4,"Well done, Putin. Top 2022 salesman of NATO. 

Before this stupid, cruel war, Germany didn't want anything to do with NATO, the Bundeswehr was underfunded and the population didn't care for soldiers, Poland started to push against the EU, Orban was openly speaking out against the entire EU project, Spain had troubles of possible sedition (catalans), the entire peace project between NATO/EU states was slowly crumbling. Europe lacked a common goal, something they could all rally behind. Financial prosperity was no longer enough. Member states didn't want to pay for military, they had their naive bubble that Europe would stay at peace, forever.

And now Putin managed to unite the entirety of Europe. NATO is stronger than ever before. Whatever Putin tried to achieve, he failed. Russia is weak. Their military is a joke, compared to the entirety of NATO. Ukraine is a relatively small country, with no Navy, little high tech gear - all they have is an iron will and the passion to defend their homeland from evil. And the 'superpower' , as some believed Russia to be , failed to defeat that. They threw everything they had at Ukraine. Their most advanced weapons. Their best troops. They used other nations to secretly attack Ukraine from the rear, against all international laws that have a meaning. They used mercenaries in secrecy, spies and traitors in Ukraine to give them unfair advantage. And still they failed. The only thing they didn't use are nukes, but those would lead to war with NATO. Ukraine is too close to the EU. Meaning they threw everything they had and could.

 Before, Putin was on one dictator level with China. Now, China has more leverage. They will dictate the years to come in that dual partnership of darkness.

It's only a matter of time until the Russian elite manage to get rid of Putin, one way or the other. He has become a liability. He is no longer giving Russia stability and prosperity. He forgot why and how he rose to power.",2022-06-27,vlvgj4,idxhl5a

411,"I'm taking you on a walk back to my original point and getting you to agree with me on everything I've said along the way, lmao. 

You've said that we're watching the border implying that our level of intelligence gathering was sufficient for deterring an attack anywhere on NATO. It implied that we would have advance warning of Russia's intent based solely on our ability to track troops movements. Keep in mind, this was in response to me pointing out that Crimea was taken by surprise and though I didn't state it, it was done by a relatively small initial force that was then reinforced over weeks by much larger forces. That initial attack was fast, successful and required relatively little troop buildup making it hard to detect via the force tracking that you implied was enough. So my Crimea point is valid. 

You then hedged and said you would need forces on high alert to handle unexpected attacks, attacks not anticipated based on the force monitoring capabilities you previously touted as being sufficient. I agree though because I don't think force tracking and intelligence are enough. If you're going to say and you should say that you can't rely on intel alone, then you have to have forces on high alert and enough of those forces given the terrain you intend to hold, the threats you anticipate facing and the sacrifices you're willing to make (how much territory you're willing to give up, even temporarily). Given the size of the border with Russia, 40k on high alert wouldn't be enough to not part with a single inch. Why? Because Russia like NATO collects intel and is aware of NATO's force posture in Europe, especially eastern Europe, giving them the advantage of choosing when, where and how to initiate conflict, even smaller conflict with limited objectives like that in Crimea, should they choose to which was my original point.",2022-06-27,vlvgj4,idymw1s

> According to data from NATO, there were 4,650 troops under direct NATO command in February 2021 or a year before Russia launched its attack against Ukraine.

> Then Russia started deploying its troops and capabilities along its shared border in Ukraine, accelerating these moves at the end of last year and in January, arguing it was a defensive move over Ukraine&#039;s NATO aspiration and the trans-Atlantic alliance&#039;s eastern expansion since the 1990s.

> Russia&#039;s aggression has also led European NATO members to pledge to significantly up their defence spending in order to reach the alliance&#039;s target of 2% of GDP. NATO members have also started a &quot;Reset&quot; of their strategy, promising to strengthen deployments and capabilities on the ground, at sea and in the air, even further.

469,"Can someone explain why we are still using troop count as a measure of military power?

There are so many other factors.

For conventional war, artillery seems to be a big deal. Capable logistics is another.

For modern warfare, training to cooperate between forces seems to count for a whole lot more than how many actual humans you have. I'm not talking about training in using your particular piece of equipment. I'm talking about larger scale training where multiple air and ground forces collaborate to achieve something they individually couldn't. Complex operations.

Never mind that technology such as cheap/abundant drones allows an ever increasing capability per human head, and we haven't even entered the age of drone swarms yet.

Feels like an overhang from some bygone era.

We end up feeding the media with these ""These guys have 40,000, and these other guys have 40,000, therefore it's on-par forces"" where in reality what one can do is a universe apart from the other. Measuring the wrong thing, all we do is misinform ourselves.

648,">Serious question here. What about the nukes? How does that factor in to all of this at this stage?

Well any firing of a nuclear weapon would probably result in a full nuclear exchange because you can't actually tell for sure if the first missile is the last or where it is heading. Especially since Russia has developed hypersonic missiles if you are the US president you have to make a decision with the information that a hypersonic missile could be on its way to New York right now. The UK has an independent deterrent so you can actually almost wait it out but the US has a lot of its nuclear weapons on the ground and they need an order to fire.

Pushing the button would mean the end of Russia as a political entity, especially the people in charge of it. It would probably also result in a global economic collapse, and the only country left with a sizeable military would be China.

Putin and the Western leaders know all this so the only time they'd choose to do it is if they were a) mad or b) this outcome was better than the alternative.

For example of NATO forces were going to actually invade Russia, Putin is done for, possibly dead. He doesn't really have much incentive to not press the button. His family are in places with bunkers as is he.

On the other hand if NATO throw Russia out of occupied territory and then keep them in Russia and don't advance... Well suddenly its not necessarily a easy choice to push that button.

This is what we will likely see if Ukraine really does start ""winning"". There won't be columns of Ukrainian military marching into Russia. At best they will retake Crimea but I highly doubt it as I don't think they have the ability to undertake an amphibious or air assault required to take Crimea from dug in Russians.

Russia was severely losing the war until it's western allies started to take North Africa back from the Axis and reduced the naval threats in North Atlantic and Mediterranean, which opened up the possibility of invasions into Southern France, Italy, Greece, etc.

Germans started withdrawing their positions in Russia in late 1942 and early 1943 because of this, which gave Russia the opportunity to turn the tide on their fronts.

For comparison, Operation Torch (allied invasions of North Africa) began on November 8th, 1942 and Operation Uranus (Russian counterattack around Stalingrad) begin on November 20th, 1943.

The only reason the Russians did so well is because Hitler forced the army to do some stupid things (read up on Operation Uranus sometime and Hitler's insistence on trying to keep the city at all costs).

In fact, the biggest reason the Axis lost could be easily argued to be Hitler himself. His decisions in half a dozen important moments during the war against advice of military leadership caused massive problems that gave a severe advantaged to the Allies many times.

But the war was won by a massive coordinated effort agreed upon milestones from each side. Russians wanted western Allies to open up other fronts to distract and weaken the Germans, and each time they did so the Russians made gains from it and vice versa.

This is a line straight from the post-war memoirs and autobiographies of the Nazis who were allowed to help write the history of the war.  Franz Halder in particular notoriously blamed every failure on either Hitler or Nazi officers who weren't in a position to defend themselves on account of either being dead or in Spandau.

The simple fact was that the German high command was incompetent.  They built a machine that was very effective in a particular type of warfare, and which worked very well in *very specific circumstances,* and then took that machine into a new environment and expected it to perform equally well in an entirely different kind of war.

The simple fact is this:  The moment it became clear that the war against the USSR was a war of extermination, Germany lost.  If they had been willing to content themselves with Poland or even perhaps the Brest-Litovsk territories, they might have won, at least short term.  However, in a war of attrition Germany was never going to defeat the USSR.  They simply did not have the stockpiles, the manpower or the logistical capacity.  German defeat was inevitable.

Whatever happens Putin is the one that caused this, the one responsible because of his notions of conquest and his vainglorious ego.

Honestly Russia's fate is similar to Weimer Germany, Putin rose on the back of the Russian Domestic Debt Default and shady tactics like the apartment bombings, the country lacked experience with Democracy, it's populace lost in Nostalgia of a time when Russia was powerful. Very Similar to how Hitler rose on the back of the 1929 crash, the ghosts of WW1 and of course the Burning of the Reichstag.

The difference though is that Hitlers Nazi Germany had the ability to wage war and actually had a disciplined Military, had developed new tactics of warfare like Blitzkrieg, it's defeat was only because it challenged too many nations and should NOT have declared war on the US. Even so the price for its defeat was catastrophic because by the time other powers acted it was too late. They failed to heed the lessons of the first world war and suffered history repeating itself.

Putin's Blyatzi Russia is a hollowed out kleptostate that literally rotted in a system of corruption of it's own making, it's leaders corrupt and system of government undisciplined, it was able to get as far as it did because it was riding on the shadow of the former USSR and hide it's real strength. It's invasion exposed the state for all to see, other nations have REMEMBERED the lessons of the 2nd world war and Ukraine's defiant defence of its homeland have ensured it will not be abandoned. This time around history wont repeat itself.

Had Russia succeeded in conquering Ukraine quickly it's likely another greater conflict could have happened down the line, now this wont happen, Russia is boxed in, it cannot fight its way out of this only withdraw, it cannot use Nukes because that would turn it's defeat into ruination. Other countries would not tolerate it as it would send a message Russia is a threat that must be destroyed at all costs. It's military is being demilitarised by a smaller nation that's better disciplined and has the full support of the major economies of 2 continents (3 if including Australia and Japan).

Whatever the future holds Russia must not only lose, it must lose so hard that it can no longer hide in denial at the actions and rot of it's society it MUST face the consequences and change itself for the better.

A formal peace treaty still has not been signed. The key stumbling block to improving relations between the Soviet Union and Japan in the post-war period has been the territorial dispute over the Kurils, which are known as the Northern Territories in Japan.

America's been producing newer and newer weapon systems every day, France is constantly researching and developing new crap, and intercept systems have been steadily researched as strongly as possible all throughout the last few decades, which have made the era of the ICBM completely obsolete.   


Go look up the MAPS system that America just rolled out. Or the laser intercept system Israel's been developing. Or Japan's Mitsubishi F3, on track to become one of the most advanced stealth fighter jets ever produced, with a missile intercept system that uses microwaves rather than traditional chaff or flares, and that can control its own wing of drones. Yeah. One pilot, one plane, several actual fighters.   


Countries all over the world put a lot of effort into developing new and improved systems every day for their armies. The countries who don't get steamrolled pretty damn quick. The countries who Do? Get to take advantage of all the tech they develop for the military in the civilian sector.

Your smartphone has several dozen technologies developed through military advancement built into it right now. The digital camera sensor, GPS navigation, photosensor amplification systems for low light photography, any number of other things. Cellulose bandages? Developed by the military.

Military spending. Software Designed Radios, as used by police radio scanners, EMS, Fire, radio astronomy, etc? Military spending. And on the most cutting edge side of things? Exoskeletal walking suits for rehabilitation of patients in hospitals. Also no military spending means Drones wouldn't exist. Which would mean that filmmakers would have to go back to chartering expensive helicopter flights to get those big establishing shots from the air they used to.   


Just because you don't hear about the new developments every day doesn't mean they aren't happening. The big arms race up to about three years ago was exoatmospheric intercept technology.

1744,"You don't fight wars for shits and giggles, you fight wars for resources.  Look at every war and behind it is a war for resources.  


The resource Russia needs is the Black Sea.  Both from an economic and military standpoint, they need access to this waterway.  Hence their invasion of Crimea.    


Ukraine was a puppet state for a period of time, and therefore Putin was OK with it being independent.  However, when the puppet government was thrown out it created a more hostile relationship with Putin.    


Inflation isn't the direct result of Russia's war with Ukraine, it's a small factor in inflation.  The bigger factor of inflation is the pandemic.  For two, almost three years, the economy around the world coped with less production and falling or stagnant prices due to low demand.  All of a sudden not only are we back to work but the cost of everything has substantially increased because demand, around the world, has increased.  


Look at the jobs market in the US.  We had the worst unemployment in US history since the Great Depression, we now have the lowest unemployment in the post-war (WWII) era, yet month after month we are still creating jobs on top of the jobs we can't fill.  For 2-3 years companies and corporations made do with fewer workers than necessary because they didn't have the business, and when demand required workers, they couldn't get them fast enough.  Not because they were slow on the draw, not because they aren't necessarily paying them a living wage (some aren't still), but because demand for workers increased in a very short period of time, making the cost of a new employee higher, making the cost of goods higher, creating inflation.  


Then you have gas.  Gasoline/Petrol is a WHOLE other issue.  In the early 2000's left and right you had oil/petrol refineries having major fires.  Instead of rebuilding those refineries and maintaining production output across several refineries rather than relying on a few, oil refining companies didn't rebuild those refineries.  In addition, they closed down some.  In doing so, they kept prices artificially high, while maintaining production.  However, since then, anytime we have a production issue, such as the fire in a southern refinery, prices skyrocket, and supplies disappear.  Our issue is not the supply of oil, yes, the price of oil has increased, our issue is the ability to refine the oil.  This is why when we released oil from the national reserves, it made no dent in the price of oil or gas.  We can flood the market with oil, but it needs to be refined and the refining capability is constrained.  


Which is why Europe, mainly Germany, relies on Russian Oil.  They aren't getting crude oil from Russia.  They get refined products from Russia via pipeline.  That pipeline literally comes from the Russian refinery.  The challenge for any country that relies upon another country for its refining capability.  You can purchase all the oil you want, what do you do with it once you purchase it?  If you don't have the capability to refine it, you need to find a country that can.

To them, this is not a battle in a foreign land with a foreign people, they are there to stay, and are selling it as ""liberation"". They can't rush without causing massive damage & loss of life, and without also suffering huge casualties thselves, so they are slowly and methodically taking one small area at a time. They can't build up a fleet in the Black sea for a naval invasion, they can't achieve total air superiority due to Ukrainian S300 systems being fed info by NATO radars and satelites, and they can't bomb Ukraine to oblivion because there goes the whole ""liberation"" story.

They've lost two ships in the Black Sea to drones, both being two of the most modern warships the Russians have in their navy!

You don't protract a war if you can afford not to, and if you have the weapons to bring a war to an end quickly you use them because otherwise the cost outweighs the benefit of the war in terms of money, men, and machines.

If you consider the Cheney Doctrine from the first Gulf War, we even achieved those goals, with one exception.

Where the mission in Iraq was a failure was that the Cheney Doctrine believed that if we installed a democracy in the Middle East the region would destabilize (which it did, the Arab Spring) and democracy would spread creating favorable relationships with the US (which did not happen).

ISIS was a direct result of the Cheney Doctrine.

That said, the 2nd Gulf War achieved its mission. It doesn't mean that anyone has to believe that was where the US should have been, I don't personally, but as far as what the mission was and did the US achieve those goals, yes we did.

Eventually its newly gained eastern territory falls back into Ukraine's hands. Ukraine desires to push even further but the west says ""that's enough"" and Russia gets to officially 'keep' Crimea.

Ukraine didn't mobilize everyone and despite russia in fact is able to forcefully mobilize more people there are three core issues with that:

1. their propaganda taught their people that Ukrainians is a weak non-existent nation, which could be easily defeated by glorious russian army in days. Meanwhile, hard brickwall of truth shows that's not the case, and publicly acknowledging it (by announcing mobilization) would break the initial propaganda-build image

2. while they do have quite a lot of people - they don't have that much extra heavy weapons, machinery and logistics capability. All of it is already deployed, there are no reserves. 

3. contrary to their 2014 invasion, this time europe, usa etc (basically whole world) is on our side. In 2014 other countries forced us to minsk agreements where we had to give up land. We had no support, we had no allies, russia had minimal sanctions they didn't care about.

> Cars: -96.7%

> Trucks: -39.3%

This leads to unemployment, the same as lack of tech parts and companies and markets in general. Unemployment leads to fewer taxes to the state and more burden on the state's social funds, it also raises risks of social unrest. At the same time the lack of trade for spare parts brings lowered production of high-tech war supplies (see recent exbibits of their _dumb_ bombs managing to miss a target 8/8 times as to why this matters). You can't just go to some global ATM where you'll insert your zombie ruble and get fighter jets back.

I am not certain of Russia's current nuclear readiness or capabilities. I know that on paper, they represent a significant nuclear threat. What is certain is that the United States maintains significant nuclear readiness and capability. Russia knows this too. The US spends $40B per year in upgrading and maintaining their nuclear weapons capabilities. I have a hard time believing that Russia has invested anything close to what the US has or that the rampant corruption we've seen evidenced in the atrocious readiness of their conventional forces doesn't also apply to their nuclear forces. 

The United States has invested trillions of dollars over the last 70 years on detecting increased potential or likelihood for a first strike by Russia or her Soviet predecessor. It is an obsession and paranoia deeply ingrained in nearly every layer of government. It is the primary reason the NSA, CIA, and DIA exist. We have expertise in that area.

If you contrast the apocalyptic ramblings of various Russian spokesholes with the utter silence and calm resolved tone of US, Five Eyes nations, NATO, and the EU, it doesn't take a genius to see that they aren't panicking.

There is a reasonable likelihood that some of those russian warheads are not maintained, not functional.

There is a reasonable likelihood that some of those russian missiles will fail to launch

There is a reasonable likelihood that the missiles will go off course, fail to hit targets

On the other hand, US missiles are maintained, functional and will land with devastating effectiveness.  

Just one leg of the nuclear triad is subs.  The US maintains 14 Ohio class submarines, the so called Boomers.  Each sub can have up to 20 Trident II D5 missiles.  Each missile can have up to 14 independently targeted warheads.  The yield for each warhead can be selected, but is limited at 475,000 tons.  Hiroshima, for perspective is 13,000 tons.

14√ó20√ó14√ó475,000 tons = 3,724,000,000,000 pounds of explosive yield.  For our Sumerian friends, that's 3 cubits.

If you've ever had a shitty boss or a shitty teacher then you already understand this. These people in authority assume it's the subordinate's fault when the subordinate's task isn't up to their code. It couldn't *possibly* be the leader's fault for failing to support the subordinate.

2504,"When I was in the Marine Corps, it was drilled into us from boot through my four years in an infantry unit, that we needed to be prepared to lead the platoon as commander, and company CO if ever necessary. Right from ITS (we used to call it Infantry Training School) I was expected to learn and understand my fireteam leader's role, squad leader's role, section leader's role (when I was in weapons platoon) and platoon sergeant. When GPS first came out I fucked around and figured out how to call in a medivac with the damn thing and next thing I know, they had me doing company clerk. Before long I was attending battalion meetings with the CO (LtCol) and SGT Major and recommending people for promotions and recognition. People like to think the US Military trains us all to be yes men and women, but it is a lot more complicated than that. When junior enlisted made solid effort but something did not work out, we were not berated. Not by the good leaders, anyway. What I heard would be, ""Good initiative, Marine. Bad judgment!"" During jungle training in Okinawa, our unit was learning how to set up and how to respond to being in an ambush. One dude kept asking, ""Why? Why should I turn into the fire and assault and not hit the deck or hide?"" No matter how many times he asked why and no matter how many times something was explained, he had a new why or why not this...? He was promoted to NCO for that. Why? The CO liked that he was willing to challenge doctrine and eventually able to fully integrate it and understand the why. The CO wanted him to be an example to the rest of us. I think it is this sort of awareness that makes it hard to defeat us on the battlefield. It helps too, that 35 years later, and my training kicks in in unexpected ways. Especially in violent or potentially life and death situations, of which I have had lots. This is probably not unique to US forces. It is likely most forces in democratic societies have this sort of expectation and latitude. The reason is because our leadership does not need to fear us.

... What price should the US pay for the hundred thousand plus dead in the Middle East?  Where does that fall on the war crimes scale?  Coalition airstrikes killed more than double the amount of children everyone is up in arms about in the last five years of Afghanistan. 

How come you're not advocating for Raytheon executives to have their assets seized, or Boeing shareholders to have their yachts seized and auctioned?  Where have you been?

On the contrary the US claims their phosphorus ***smoke shells*** (e.g. M825 155mm shells) are not used to set fire to stuff but are only used for smoke generation, to hide friendly troops; that is how they get away firing phosphorus smoke shells on civilian areas. 

That said, the smoke (phosphorus pentoxide) is highly toxic. The US military used phosphorus shells to smoke out Iraqi rebels in Fallujah Iraq in Nov 2004, and later ISIS in 2014-16. They‚Äôd saturate an area with phosphorus smoke and then bomb fighters out in the open after they exited their bunkers and foxholes for fresh air (Israel likely uses the same tactics). They called it ‚ÄúShake and Bake‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe fired ‚Äòshake and bake‚Äô missions at the insurgents, using WP to flush them out and HE to take them out.‚Äù

Using the asphyxiant effects of phosphorus may contravene the Chemical Weapons Convention, which bans using any chemical weapons to kill or injure the enemy (the CW Convention is very strict, even tear gas is banned in war (but not civilian riots)).

2904,"Everything you say shows ignorance of the current state of American society.  

The Republican Party has developed a mentality where ""big government"" is always assumed to be bad and any exercise of government power must be justified and weighed against all possible faults and arguments, real or imaginary, before that power is allowed to be given to the federal government.  If Republican voters do not have something to complain about, the Republican Party will gladly make something up and those voters won't just stare at it, they will eat it.  ""Critical Race Theory"" is a fantastic example of fabricated controversy.  So is ""post-birth abortion"".  These tactics are effective in allowing the Republican Party to implement the broad stroke policies that result in the matters you want to hear complaints about without causing too much fuss among their own voters.  In addition, Republicans have been sticking out the threat of civil war and rubbing it for so long that I'm worried they need to go see a doctor before they sustain permanent damage to the poor thing.  

The Democratic Party has the issue of trying to hold on to the last shreds of the mask of representation.  The legal framework that protected the right of women in the United States to access abortion at the federal level was revoked and the power to determine whether or not a woman can access abortion is now decided by the state she is currently in.  Many states had legislation in place to take effect only if Roe vs. Wade was overturned, so abortion was effectively banned in much of the United States immediately.  While this is shocking, it is the logical conclusion of a train of events where Republicans have used the Constitution to force their way into deciding on whether or not such rights exist on the national level.

Since you're not from around these parts, while abortion isn't exactly ""popular"" it is a pretty solid majority of Americans that believe that women should have the right to access and receive an abortion in the United States if she chooses to do so until the point of viability.  The fact that the legal mechanism that enshrined a human right was revoked against the opinion of this majority of citizens is extremely troubling and invokes distrust in the very framework of our government.

>3. It is further prohibited to make any military objective located within a concentration of civilians the object of attack by means of incendiary weapons other than air-delivered incendiary weapons, except when such military objective is clearly separated from the concentration of civilians and all feasible precautions are taken with a view to limiting the incendiaryeffects to the military objective and to avoiding, and in any event to minimizing, incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects.

>4. It is prohibited to make forests or other kinds of plant cover the object of attack byincendiary weapons except when such natural elements are used to cover, conceal or camouflage combatants or other military objectives, or are themselves military objectives.

1. No targeting civilians, period

3012,"As for military equipment, Ukraine claims to have disabled some 1,500 Russian tanks, 3,600 armored vehicles, 750 artillery pieces, and 210 aircraft since February 24, 2022. These are considerable figures according to specialists, although all agree that they are overestimated. About 800 tanks have been lost, or about 7% of the entire Russian army, even though it would be closer to 10% to 15% if we only consider the tanks ready to be sent into battle, according to military specialists.

The state of ammunition reserves also raises questions. Although the former Red Army has huge arsenals inherited from the Soviet era, they are often old equipment. Its reserves of modern weapons are more modest and have been largely depleted. According to the Pentagon, Moscow has already used 60% of its cruise missiles.

‚ÄúWe have noticed that Russia is carrying out far fewer rocket attacks and it has used H-22 rockets; they are old 1970s Soviet rockets,‚Äù noted Vadym Skibitsky, deputy head of Ukrainian military intelligence, in The Guardian on June 10, 2022. ‚ÄúRussian cruise missile stocks are probably running out,‚Äù confirmed the British Ministry of Defence in a statement published on 20 June 2022.

And reading the comments, I also have the feeling that this could be taken as propaganda and people are taking it straight away.The only good news I see is that Russia left the snake island (it was not really a ukrainian battle victory); they went back on few areas that they didnt consider important.But they are progressing, and they are following their strategy. They won Donbass battle. UKR is still not able to take back Kherson. and progress on the coast.Ukraine army is missing everything, sometimes even rifles. We can guess they have way more casualties than what they communicate. Their economy is almost ruined.They will get cannons, weapons, trainings from the west, ok. It's super slow. It will take months. And it won't be enough.

In the meantime we just read that Russia just announced they shift their economy into war economy, and introduce mobilization. This is a huge step.

They have shitloads of money, despite the sanctions. They have ''friends''countries all over the world. And those who are not their friends don't care about this war.

And people here applause? wth? We don't see the same things probably. Russia is currently winning the war. Where will they stop? No idea.I guess it will be after taking Odessa (that would be a tragedy).

I remain optimistic, Ukraine will win. but currently, they are dying. And this article is not a. good news, because the war will last longer. Which is a tragedy. My best friend who is serving in the south front (as I heard, it's difficult to have news) and my colleague's relatives also fighting are dealing with life every second.

I have a russian colleague. I discussed the situation with him. He probably will never return in Russia (he was already in trouble in Russia for years as he was not exactly a Putin's supporter and had issues). He told me, and he was very devastated when saying it: In western countries you are laughing about russian propaganda, but you do more and more the same. And you are completely wrong about what's happening in Russia. The situation has not deteriorated that much. Life is going on, almost as usual. But the hate is growing. Propaganda is doing an efficient job. Putin could realize his objective to have his population very supportive. And it will come one ay or another, when Ukraine will use a US/NATO weapon against russian civilians. Putin could even do a fake terrorist attack; he already did that for his war in Chechnya. this could change a lot of things. And remember that the entire world doesn't like Nato, and even hate USA.

The biggest mistake in a war is when we underestimate the enemy. Putin did that.I have the feeling that many people are doing the same now.

Let's be optimistic, positive, for the people outthere, for my friend Oleksii fighting there, but let's not be stupid. War is not over, ukrainian army is dying, and even lots of HIMARS and hi tech artillery wouldnt be enough.... air support, more diverse vehicles, missiles...

I personally think that Ukrainian numbers, especially about equiptment are relatively reliable, because they have huge fluctuations and also ""bad"" days when they cannot report triumphant success.

Also, oryx confirmed numbers of destroyed Russian equipment are actually in line with the Ukrainian reported numbers, because oryx only uses visual confirmation, which sometimes is a rare commodity, since so much Russian equipment is destroyed without a single photo ever being taken.

I assume that at least 66% of the losses of IFV, BTRs and MLRS are not documented, because they are either low priority targets or far from the front lines (MLRS), which will not be documented for obvious reasons. But still confirmed numbers are relatively high, and if you add another 200% on top (the 66% not visually confirmed) you come rather close to Ukrainian numbers.

At any rate, my 66% is just a rough guessimate, could be 50 or 75. But the main point is: russian losses are certainly much higher than confirmed losses.",2022-07-01,vp782j,iehzmy9

It's a matter of design philosophy. Americans/Brits replaced steel components with titanium ones, sacrificing reliability for lower weight, because as the world's biggest warmonger, they have a new war to fight in some far-flung corner of the world with fucked up transpory infrastructure every other week. Meaning, these things need to be airlifted easily, and anyways, American airpower ensures that the M777's limited ability to sustain fire is compensated for by other assets.

Ukraine isn't fucking Afghanistan. They have rail, bridges, and plenty of trucks. What they need is cold war era howitzers that are designed to fire for months with little maintenance to shred enemy mechanised divisions, not fancy modern shit like the M777 that needs a new barrel every other day because it's designed to atomise fucking third world peasants in flip-flops organised in small insurgent squads with a couple of shells from 30km aways.

Same thing with those Caesars. THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE ARMOUR. France in the 90s decided that we will never have to face a serious foe again, cut the military budget, and then realized that there is no money left to modernise our AuF1s. Solution? Design a poor man's SPG, without armour, and on a civilian Renault truck chassis, cause why the fuck not? We only have to fight colonial wars with tribes in Africa now that the Soviets killed themselves.

We are mostly responsible for the situation, even though NATO and ukrainians have done some immoral bullshit as well.

In the 2014 revolution, most ukrainians had noble intentions indeed, they wanted european wages and stronger democratic representation. The problem is that some western ukrainians used this government overthrow in order to dominate the eastern ukrainians. They were destroying soviet statues and banning the russian language for example, even if all eastern ukrainians spoke russian. You can definitely make the argument that DNR and LNR were created by the FSB, but 100s of thousands of the seperatists wouldnt have been mobilized for the Russian side, if western Ukrainians actually treated them well.

There are also the NATO and economic resources parts of the equation, which deserve entire books dedicated to them as well.

From China, India, South East Asia, to Latin America to Africa, we have seen how American and European governments are sacrificing the entire world economy and global food security  just to spite on Russia

As Dr. Subramaniam Jaishankar put it: ""Europe has to grow out of the mindset that Europe's problems are the world's problem but the world's problems are not Europe's problems"".

The fact is: 'Russian invasion of Ukraine' to countries like China, Brazil, India...etc... isn't that much different to US's invasion on Iraq, or Saudi invasion on Yemen. It was a continental or European issue, that they failed to resolve diplomatically when they have the chance, leading to a meaningless civilian suffering. Instead of trying everything to end it, Europe and America are actively prolonging this conflict on purposes and worsening it every steps of the way, leaving the entire world be damned just cause they fancy some dick waving contest with Russia.

'But... but... Russia...' Nah fk these Russian blaming bs. The Western governments doesn't give a fck about the rest of the world. If Western governments spent as much efforts to shift foods out of Ukraine as shifting weapons into Ukraine, the global food security would have eased months ago. Look at how quick the West bow down to Erdogan, a dictator demand, just to spite Russia. Or bow at the Bone Saw Prince who has been doing worse atrocities. Or Netanyahu. But can't even make a deal with Russia to ease global fuel prices or global food security

Just to remind that most of the historical bombings across Africa, Asia and Latin America have been done or supported by these same European countries.

The United States, for example, or the same Norway - do these countries sell gas at the old low prices? Certainly not. All gas sellers are rowing loot, but Putin is the zloty here. But if someone has a good memory, he can remember that the Europeans themselves, through the courts, canceled the prices for long-term contracts with Gazprom, because at that moment the price on the stock exchange was falling and the Europeans tied prices (through the courts) to the stock exchange. Therefore, now Gazprom sells gas for 5-7 times more expensive than usual.

3442,"Posted this on a different thread, but figured I'd drop it here.

Let me throw my hat in here. On every other sub ive been called a putinbot/troll/shill/etc.

I am Russian born to a Ukrainian (born in Crimea) Mother and Russian Father. I have been in the US for 30 years now, consider myself an American. I speak Russian fluently, understand Ukrainian very well, and spent most of my early childhood in Crimea (Kerch, Feodosiya, etc). I have family on both sides of this war. I have family in Kiev, Moscow, and still in Crimea. It is my family, my people being killed on both sides of this war.

It absolutely pisses me off how both countries I consider mine are being pitted against each other. I'm not going to get into the whole CIA backing of the 2014 revolution, clear war crimes in Donbas and Luhansk, and the clear actions of NATO, the EU and the US government to push the world to the edge of WW3. People have been warning about this war for decades, even the current head of the CIA said years ago that if we keep antagonizing Russia, this is what will happen.

Yes, Putin is a piece of shit, but to say there weren't legitimate reasons for the invasion is ridiculous, and I'm not talking about the denazification propaganda. There is enough blame to go around. Placing the blame 100% at Russia's feet is naive at best. Ukraine is not the beacon of democracy that the west says it is. The reason Ukraine is so important to Europe and the US, other than sticking a thumb in Russia's eye, is it is the money laundering capital of the world. Gangs, Mafia, government, all take a slice of the pie.

Why do you think Rand Paul wanted the 40BILLION dollars of aid to be audited? Because he knows most of that shit will end up in peoples pockets. Lets also not forget that what is happening in Ukraine now, America has done multiple times. America destabilized the entire middle east with our imperialistic bullshit. We destroyed Iraq, Libya, Syria. We funded terrorists and basically created ISIS. What kills me most about this whole situation is the hypocrisy of these people, blaming Russia for doing shit many other countries have done in recent history.

The only quick way out of this is a peace deal. That simple. Its not ideal, but it will stop the killing and give Russia and Ukraine a ground to work from. Problem is, when Zelensky tried to put Minsk 2 into action, Azov absolutely refused orders. There are videos of this. Zelensky was extremely close to making peace deals with Russia multiple times the last few months, yet every time there was a visit from a European leader or a US politician to get him back in line. Peace is not in the best interest of the US and Europe. They are looking at this as a way to weaken Russia permanently. Again, enough blame to go around. Unfortunately the MSM will never be honest about this war. Even after all of the lies about Iraq, lies about Trump, Lies about everything, people still believe the shit they peddle.

3453,"How would the Ukrainian people react to an announcement that Zelensky has entered negotiations with the likely result being the recognition of Crimea as Russian territory, the recognition of Donbas as autonomous/free to govern themselves, and the rewriting of its constitution so as to not join NATO ever.  Would these three terms be acceptable to them?

Likewise on the part of the Russian people, would these three terms be acceptable as a final outcome to this conflict despite having to give back all territory gained outside of Donbas and Crimea?  

Because I have a feeling that the populaces of both countries would reject these terms.  The Ukrainians would obviously be infuriated that they lost these territories and all the thousands of troops that attempted to prevent it.  

And the Russian people would likely reject them as well given that they too have lost thousands upon thousands of troops and weaponry to achieve the gains that they have currently achieved.  And it might be a slap in the face to them to ""only"" come away with Crimea and an ""autonomous"" Donbas.  They may consider everything East of the Dnipro as the only acceptable outcome given the large economic and personal costs of the operation so far.

This is likely why we have not had even a millimeter of progress on the diplomatic side since the talks in Turkey several months ago.

3458,"So I'm with another question to Russian people. Here I see that many of the Russia supporters call foreign fighters being mercenaries, so justifying for their handling of such. 

So a **question from me**: How do you define what is a mercenary and what isn't?

As I have been doing some digging, trying to justify foreign fighters being mercenaries and have come to this [definitive guide of what is and isn't a mercenary](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/WebART/470-750057).

1. A mercenary shall not have the right to be a combatant or a prisoner of war.

2. A mercenary is any person who:

* ‚ùì (a) is specially recruited locally or abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict;

* ‚úÖ (b) does, in fact, take a direct part in the hostilities;

* ‚ùì (c) is motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and, in fact, is promised, by or on behalf of a Party to the conflict, material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of that Party;

* ‚úÖ (d) is neither a national of a Party to the conflict nor a resident of territory controlled by a Party to the conflict;

* ‚ùì (e) is not a member of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict; and

* ‚úÖ (f) has not been sent by a State which is not a Party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces.

Two contentious points being (a), (c) and (e).


(a) If *recruited* is the same as *volunteered* then this is criteria stands.

(c) This is the point I see touted here the most. I did not find anything concrete about the pay in any kind of official or advertised manner. So at the very least the pay is not used to attract the fighters, yet I also haven't found anything saying that substantial pay is offered even after arrival. I asked my acquaintance how much if any is he getting paid for being there, and he said fuck-all, and after further inquiring said around $300/mo when converted. So at least in his case the ""substantially in excess of promised pay to other armed forces combatants"" criteria wouldn't hold.

(e) Some say that to be a member of the armed forces all you need to do is to join the structure of the armed forces in an official manner and be subordinate to their command, which foreigners do. But they haven't been trained by the armed forces and bring their own training. I haven't found anything regarding is this is considered a point of distinction or not. 

So I hate to be that guy who screams ***source*** with foam coming out of his mouth, but I would like to prove foreign fighters are indeed mercenaries as stated by the definition but I lack evidence. So anyone knows some sources I couldn't find?",2022-06-15,up1xmu,icgyeqh

We're seeing a violent culmination of Ukrainian denial of history and whitewashing Nazi criminals and toleration of large violent Nazi groups and Russian romanticisation of Imperialism and association with psychotics like Dugin and policy of threats of ""rebuilding"" pre-1917 Russian Empire.

From Ukrainian side, we see consequences in Russia getting into confirmation bias spiral about Nazi Ukraine.

3469,"I don't understand why Western onlooker can't look at this war without their rose tinted glasses. This is not the 19th century anymore, there are undeniable facts out there.

Like, everyone could agree that the Russia's initial plan to quickly capture Kiev failed miserably. Their attempts on Kiev and on the north led to lots of human power and resources without much to show for (other than destruction to the local population of course). Then the sinking of their flagship was a huge disaster. The loss of all of their generals too.

But for Ukraine, why it is so hard to admit that they fked it up big time here:

1. Knowing the power of Russian force now, then the fall of Kherson, Melitopol were a disaster. They could have blown up the Crimea bridge and limit all Russian operation in the south. Or blowing up the bridge leading to Kherson and could protect everything West of the Dniper.
2. Related to 1st point, losing Berdiansk and Volnovakha, leading to the encircling of Mariupol and the loss of more than 5000 experienced troops ( 3500 prisoners) were a disaster. How can anyone think the surrendering of a whole army is a success? Like if the Russians veteran fighters were surrounded and surrendered in the thousands, we would have all laughed at how much of a bunch of losers they are.
3. Defending Mariupol was a success in buying time, was it? For what? Mariupol is literally the Russian most important target in the entire Ukraine (just behind Kiev and Odessa). Russia will never be able to take Kiev or Odessa, even if they thrown all the men in Mariupol there. Even Kharkiv is not as important strategically as Mariupol. The event unfolded after Mariupol showed that the bought time Mariupol provided didn't help Ukraine much as we now knows this war will continue to be grinded for years
4. Trying to defend every single untenable position, while admirable, was frankly stupid. Why ppl think guarding an entrenched position while Russian just pounded your positions using artillery is considered as 'bleeding the Russians'? Russian current strategy is literally sending out a scouting party, probing for where Ukraine is firing from, then pound that position days and night will artillery shells till the Ukraine can't tend their positions anymore and either get overrun or retreat. The Russians are literally trading time and resources to reduce their own casualties, something the American war is all about. So what is with these 'professional, tactical retrograde' and 'holding on positions to bleed the Russian' bs. The Ukraine should have withdrawn from Sievierodonetsk, cut off the bridge, and defend/ retake Popasna to secure their flank. Now they are losing their nature defend of the Siversky river (which is what holding the Russians back all this time), lost their flank and all of the men guarding there (Zolete, Popasna, etc) and Lysychansk and all defenders gonna get surrounded.
5. Playing down losing Sievierodonetsk and soon Lysychansk as some unnamed towns, are also dumb as fk. As mentioned, they had the Siversky river ran through them, which is a proven natural barrier to defend against the Russian. And both of them are also in top 50 largest cities in Ukraine. That is like calling Tampas, Oakland, or Minami as 'some nameless towns'

There was a saying, about how the fascist will always lose in war. Cause they can't handle reality, underestimate the opponent while big up their own achievement. The Russians were guilty of that during their 1st phase of the war, and get their arses kicked badly. But now it's the Ukraine and the West turn.

3486,"The Biggest issue I have with this war, besides the War crimes that get committed(Primarily by one side) is the reasoning that given by Pro Russians on this war.   


1. Russia wanted Ukraine to be a border ground between them and NATO.   
This is a complete Fantasy  for 2 main reasons, In 2014 Russia invaded Ukraine after a popular uprising from the people towards a president who didn't want to enter the European Union, something that was wanted by a majority of Ukrainians, With that invasion this pushed Ukraine to be distrustful and hateful of Russia, Pushing them towards NATO. So no there's no NATO aggression, not like in the Cold War. In Short, You can't get mad that the person you punched ends up not liking you and wanting to be in a group with your enemy's    
2.  Russia feeling threatened.  
This one is the only one that actually has merit mostly because NATO is a Threat to Current Russia. Not because NATO is Going to Invade Russia but because NATO wants to Curb Russian Expansion so they are in the way of Russia having a larger sphere of influence. Mind you NATO is not planning to invade Russia any time soon, at least in a first strike sense. NATO has always been a more defensive alliance rather then Offensive one. Just look at the response to the IRAQ war and Afghanistan sepretly, one was more condoned because one was for aggression and the other mostly a defensive reaction. Did Ukraine Drop bombs into Russia before the war began?? Did Georgia Commit terrorist attacks against Russia before its invasion??  ITs a flat out no to both questions. And just like America's invasion of Iraq, Russia's invasion of Ukraine is unjustified and has no moral standing and should have never happened.   
3. War Crimes done by Ukraine.  
I am not gonna sit here and say that Ukraine is innocent in the war of Donbass before this current conflict. But I am not going to blow it out of proportions. There is no Genocide of Russians being committed, there never was, especially when half of the country itself is either Russian or a mix of Russian and Ukrainian. Just to give you an idea of what the Ukrainians where doing prior to war, I'd say in some ways very similar to Ireland in its attempt to reclaim its original language. They were never outlawing Russian all they were doing was encouraging the return of Ukrainian alongside Russian, so that the history and Language of Ukraine wouldn't be lost to time. So no there is little to no evidence for a Genocide, or even the implementations of one. so this reason is a mute point.  
4. Denazification.  
This ones been thrown a lot, especially with the Azov battalion, The Azov battalion are neo Nazis. That is a fact. But Russia itself has an actual disturbing amount of Neo Nazis as well,  and in Russia it is way more prevalent then Ukraine. The same goes for the US. The US and Russia have more of a Nazi Problem then Ukraine had at the start of the war. The far right Party in Ukraine which is supported by Azov got only 2 percent in the last election. while both Russia and the US have at least 5-10 percent of their population depicting nationalistic Nazi tendency's. Many genuine Far right/ Nazi Political leaders where actually kicked out of office by both Porchenko(honestly I forgot how to spell his name) and Zelensky. Many were Fired or Voted out of office in the last 5 years. Ironically Zelenskys Party in Ukraine is a center left liberal party who won over 70% of the vote. So no this wasn't even for Denazification.   
5. Its the US's fault all a long(no it wasn't.)  
I propose a scenario for you one that will portray the situation but in the NA region. If Mexico were too try and join the CSTO. The US would feel threatened by that, having a Russian Ally on their doorstep would scare many Americans and the US itself. However the US would never do a pre emtive invasion of Mexico. For 2 Simple Reasons. One, the US has to much economic infrastructure to risk a war with Mexico, and Two. Because unlike Russia the US is not a one Party Far Right Reactionary Dictatorship. So there would never be a consensus on the issue, if the Democrat's were in power during this situation the Dems wouldn't do anything. If the Republican's where in Power they also wouldn't do anything, not because they don't want to but because they can't, It would be political suicide, would cause a recession and would likely mean the other party taking over, The US would loose massive amounts of credibility within its own country and around the world. Many Allies of the US would probably leave them in that situation and it would put the US in a worse position. and even then after all this the US still invades. The US has no Justification for it, because the Mexican people choose to join the CSTO. The same Way the Ukrainian, Finish, and Swedish now wish to be in NATO, and should be allowed to because its their wish and after a subsequent invasion of a neighbor of Russia's (in the case of Finland and Sweden) and for Ukraine, well getting Invaded is a good fucking reason to join a defensive alliance.

&#x200B;

SO My conclusion is. If you are Pro Russia that is fine, I disagree with you on every level on this conflict but that's your choice. However Do not go spoutting lies and propaganda about why Putin Started this war. WE already know why. Putin Wants to  Improve Russia's World standing. He wants to have Control over Ukraine and Belarus, Weather as a genuine ally, Puppet, or Directly. He himself said. 'Ukraine is not a sovereign Country' Its ok to support either side, but do not lie to your self that Putin was only trying to protect from scary NATO. He Invaded a sovereign country because they were trying to befriend a Foreign Enemy.   


(Epilogue) So when  you say why doesn't Ukraine beg for Peace, or Why doesn't the US and the West stop supplying Ukraine with weapons. Remember to tell yourself that it wouldn't bring a white peace for both sides to enjoy, its your Pro Russia Side getting a victory. so do not blame the west for supplying Ukraine, the same way the US couldn't blame Russia for supplying the Taliban in Afghanistan. You can get mad that they are but do not whine that its warmongering, because if the situation was reverse You would be saying the same thing to me about Russia Supplying (insert US Enemy Here) because its Geo politics.

* a) Recruited and volunteered is the same. This condition is checked if you where given a new position for this conflict. Opposed to contract soldiers or contract security that are on payroll before the conflict.
* c) This is completely up to the court's interpretation. First salaries are probably hidden for the purpose of dodging being called a mercenary. And *private gain* does not refer to only direct salary, but also fame or indirect money (sponsors, plan to give conferences later, write a book, etc...). So the judges could decide whatever they want here.
* e) Any court examines conditions for crime characterisation and immunity **at the time the crime is committed** (or planned the crime if planning the crime is also a crime). Not at the time of arrest, and not at the time you gain immunity. At the time these soldiers planned to become mercenaries in Ukraine, planned to train and fight, they where not yet in UAF.

Answer: The elite of the West explains to its layman: Russians are bad, you can't buy anything from them, but it's impossible to survive without their resources, which means that these resources must be taken away, especially since bad Russians don't deserve them; this is just a large-scale preparation of Western public opinion for a third world war, including a nuclear one.

3662,"While I do think that some Russian concerns about the region are legitimate (in particular I consider it in the long-term interest of everyone that Crimea remains Russian, even if disagree with how the transfer was effected), Putin‚Äôs statements that the war was absolutely necessary are in my view, purely fictional. The conflict was frozen; in the entire year prior, by LPR/DPR statements, you had less than 40 civilian casualties, which thanks to the invasion you now see multiple on a daily basis if not more. I don‚Äôt consider preemptive strikes to be legitimate in the first place (mostly due to the slippery slope and easy excuse it provides), but the evidence provided for the pretext in this case is very much unconvincing. From what I can see, Putin is also heavily underplaying the willingness of EU countries in particular to diplomatically work on the concerns that Russia had; there were efforts by many EU members to a) keep negotiation open with Russia (Merkel, Macron, and others) but also efforts to pressure Ukraine on problematic stances (the EU had pressured the country to remove discriminatory language laws (partially already successfully), and also working on the removal of far-right elements from the Ukrainian army, as conditions to further economic integration). 

As a whole; I believe Putin‚Äôs decision to solve the issue with a large-scale invasion to be completely unacceptable. As a result I believe it to be important that he should not be allowed to achieve his objectives in the country, because that would set a very dangerous precedent of force being a more effective tool than diplomacy, setting future world stability into jeopardy.",2022-05-13,up1xmu,i8ig5by

This gonna do more harms than good

They should have organised their troops into defensive lines and withdraw the defenders back at every potential encirclement. Sure they will give up more town and cities, but that is how they could preserve their main/ experienced fighting force, waiting for Russian mistakes to counter-attacks

As it is right now, most of their frontline experienced troops in Donbass are either dead/ fatally injured under shelling, or encircled and imprisoned. The new inexperienced troops will be much less experienced, and much less willing to fight back and hold positions. Means the more battle harden troops would eventually be surrounded when their flanks retreat (kinda like the case of Lysychansk now)

OK again another instance where other countries do it too, the USA does preassure others to sanction Russia, but have you seen the USA invade a country because of not implementing sanctions?? no and countries have not been threatened with sanction on them for not having sanctions on Russia, look at US Israeli relationship, or all of Africa, or even most of Asia. 

One the Dollar is not forced upon anyone besides those in the Americas, and in most cases its not because they are threaten by it, but because its a more stable currency then their own. And in fact idk if you knew but Europe uses Euros for the most part not the US Dollar.  
Russia obviously opposes that, because Russia wants to be a superpower again, so why in gods name would Russia ever have the US dollar as their currency, that was never brought up anywhere in the last 40 years, and if it was its stupid.

So your saying that a Nation who's had Luke warm relations at best and borderline hateful rival, broke a promise, one that was made verbally not on paper, to a nation that doesn't exist anymore?? this points the dumbest one and is just to placate no fault. 

That revolution had nothing to do with the US, in fact it was about the European union, Ukraine had wanted to start the process of integrating into the EU then Russia pressured their president at the time to cancel the deal for more economic deals with Russia, the People got upset and revolted. Because the PEOPLE WANTED TO JOIN THE EU OF THEIR OWN VOLITION. It had nothing to do with the US, in  fact the US didn't give 2 shits about Ukraine until around last year. there was no CIA plot to instigate a revolt, when Russia caused it themselves. with decades of unwanted involvement in the region  


what do you mean take Crimea through Ukraine??, You mean Rightfully give back land that was Ukrainian is the 50s under the Soviet Union??? and was unlawfully annexed by Russia??

The anti Russian sentiment is self inflicted, They constantly meddled in Ukrainian Politics, Invaded then on 2 separate occasions in 10 years, considered Ukraine as having no sovereignty. Threaten them with war for wanting to protect themselves. In what way is that the US's fault. And of course the US is gonna help Ukraine with training, its basic strategy. SO now your mad that Ukraine wanted protection so they started seeking help from the enemy's of the nation they were most afraid of??? And asked for training, and wanted to enter into the said alliance, in which over 70 % of the population has to agree on in order for them to even start the process.

>Russia must continue to advance to keep its momentum

How far do you think Russia could advance in Ukraine?

Even though Russia does have the upper hand in Donbas at the moment and will likely make further gains in the East at this rate, the deeper they advance into Ukraine, the more challenges they will face logistically in territory where Russia is not as popular as Donbas.

If no one interferes with the development of Russia, then we have no interest in other countries, we are quite large and self-sufficient. Not like China now, of course, but enough to live well. That's why the United States and its satellites hate us. It's my opinion.

I don't know if you know how much pressure the US has put on other countries over the past 80 years. And this has increased greatly over the past 30 years after the collapse of the USSR. Economically speaking, the US has the ability to earn one dollar to spend five thanks to the current global economic system that they maintain by bullying and destroying other countries. That is, the powerful economy of the United States is paid for by all other countries.

The United States gained this opportunity during World War II and the subsequent Bretten Woods Agreement (fixing the dollar as the single currency and pegging its value to gold at $35 per ounce), which created a huge demand for dollars and a booming US economy. At that time, the US was consuming too many resources and was simply devouring its (global) economy. Then, by 1971, Europe and Japan had recovered from World War II, and it became clear to everyone that the dollar was grossly overvalued. The US carried out the so-called Nixon shock. They simply refused to pay the gold bills. And six years before that, there was Degaulle's demarche (this is also a very good indicator)

And since 1971, the United States has put great pressure on all other countries with its military potential and the establishment of puppet political regimes to maintain the role of the dollar as the single world currency in order to maintain demand for the dollar. Since 1944, the US has directly invaded 33 countries (in the end, this led to the death of about 11 million civilians). This is not counting how many political puppet regimes they have established in other countries by paying for and conducting ""revolutions"" by replacing real national governments with their corrupt puppets!

and in response to your question, the Russians simply want to cooperate while maintaining their sovereignty and national interests. We don't want NATO on our borders, we don't have nuclear missiles in Cuba. We're not going to attack anyone. We have everything we need. Huge territory, huge reserves of energy and natural resources.

 From the US perspective Europe is not a priority, Asia is the priority for commercial and security concerns in the 21st century. The US has little interest getting bogged down in European problems when we should be focusing in the pacific. The US does not benefit from Ukranians wanting to join NATO but it can't well stop them either. 

 Their people widely support further integration with Europe. They see the standard of living in Poland, the baltics, and Finland and would take that anyday over being a vassal of Russia like Belarus or Kazakhstan. Both of which their people have revolted similarly to Ukraine only to be put down by Russian security forces. The integrity of Russian influence relies on squashing self determination, something they have failed at and continue to fail at in Ukranie just like the USSR did. The ""democratically elected government"" that was suspiciously pro russian ignored a popular referendum in favor of trade with the EU. Their government influenced by Russia was acting against its people's sovereignty, when the people protested they shot them in the streets.

 Russia could have reached out for commercial ties, it could've sweetened the deal and competed with the west for Ukranie's favor instead their matra is ""love mother Russia or else...."" they cannot fathom treating Ukraine like an ally and an equal instead they need a vassal. Ukranians are tired of being vassals.

The US did not force the UK, Germany, or France to join NATO they did so based on mutual benefit and the will of their people, if any of those countries withdrew from the alliance it would be a blow but the US wouldn't invade them to overthrew their government because we know what's best for them.

Crimea was annexed to the Ukrainian SSR at the whim of Khrushchev. There was a Russian majority in Crimea. Then it would not cause a sensation, because, it would seem, we live in the same country! It doesn't matter that something is given to someone, we are in the USSR!  
But when the USSR collapsed, Khrushchev's gift was reflected.  
Maidan began in 2014.

It's really a huge pro-Russian region. No fifth column happened when Crimea returned to Russia.  
Same thing with Donbass. Donbass was annexed to Ukraine by Lenin's decree to form the Ukrainian SSR, until that moment there was always a Russian majority in the Donbass.  
If there had not been a pro-Russian majority in the LPR or DPR, I think that these quasi-republics would not have been formed in principle.  


\>The anti Russian sentiment is self inflicted, They constantly meddled in Ukrainian Politics, Invaded then on 2 separate occasions in 10 years, considered Ukraine as having no sovereignty. Threaten them with war for wanting to protect themselves. In what way is that the US's fault. And of course the US is gonna help Ukraine with training, its basic strategy. SO now your mad that Ukraine wanted protection so they started seeking help from the enemy's of the nation they were most afraid of??? And asked for training, and wanted to enter into the said alliance, in which over 70 % of the population has to agree on in order for them to even start the process.

\>OK again another instance where other countries do it too, the USA does preassure others to sanction Russia, but have you seen the USA invade a country because of not implementing sanctions?? no and countries have not been threatened with sanction on them for not having sanctions on Russia, look at US Israeli relationship, or all of Africa, or even most of Asia.

Have you ever visited WikiLeaks? Have you read the Afghan War Diary to say that the US is not at the level of Russia?  
Intimidating Finland and Sweden is a common geopolitical move against Pax Americana. Perhaps I need to explain that the world lives on Pax Americana, but there are countries that do not want to live on Pax Americana. There is another question for the US. 9/11 was arranged by two people on student visas from Saudi Arabia. Why did the US attack Iraq? And further. Why did the US support the Syrian Opposition, which differs from the terrorists only by a shoulder patch and which soldiers killed an 8-year-old boy because they considered him a spy for Bashar al-Assad?  
Needless to say, one hegemon is purer than another, for every superpower has its skeletons in the closet. The US could not pressure countries for not implementing sanctions, but they could well afford to bomb Yugoslavia or invade Iraq.

\>That revolution had nothing to do with the US, in fact it was about the European union, Ukraine had wanted to start the process of integrating into the EU then Russia pressured their president at the time to cancel the deal for more economic deals with Russia, the People got upset and revolted. Because the PEOPLE WANTED TO JOIN THE EU OF THEIR OWN VOLITION. It had nothing to do with the US, in fact the US didn't give 2 shits about Ukraine until around last year. there was no CIA plot to instigate a revolt, when Russia caused it themselves. with decades of unwanted involvement in the region

And further. About Maidan. Maidan was primarily against the president and only after his resignation for joining the European Union. And imagine, there really were and are people who did not want to join the European Union and wanted to be with Russia. Imagine, there were people who were against the crimes in Iraq, taking place with the tacit connivance of the European Union.

USA has the biggest invasion army because USA is the biggest invader and the biggest bully, it's not to defend itself. It's literally USA's business model.

\>First off... that's not what a Nazi is. I even think most people in Russia are white supremacists given the ""Western liberal"" definition.  


  
You, apparently, do not know the history of the Azov, Aidar, Donbass battalions at all. For you, even Nazi stripes are not a sign of sympathy for the ideas of the nation. Maybe even their own words are not a sign? Completely blind vision of the situation.  
Azov and Aidar were known just for torturing people, you can find a lot of information about this on your own. You literally justify the terrorists, who do not differ in methods from the terrorists in Syria. They themselves called for the Russians to be slaughtered and allowed them to shoot at those who were ""without a bandage."" I also advise you to look at the emblems of these battalions and the symbols on them, which ""mean nothing.""  


  
The definition of ""Western liberal"" has no problem. There is liberalism in relation to the Western model of the state and liberalism in relation to the Russian model of the state. I need to explain that there are things that have certain properties relatively? There is a liberal in relation to the Western state and a liberal in relation to the Russian state. Moreover, there is not a single armed Nazi formation at the state level.  
\>Classic Nazism is an ideology that believes war of expansion is necessary to keep the nation strong, that the nation should be ruled by a dictator with disregard to the parliament system. Kind of sounds like Russia.  
  
You came up with a new definition, which is also logically contradictory. In the definition of Nazism, there is no expansion to preserve the nation, this comes as a consequence. Nazism itself is the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe superiority of one nation over another. If you had said about militarism, this could still be understood. Russia invaded Ukraine to save citizens of the LPR and DPR. And you're a racist if you don't recognize them as human beings.

I think that's part of the bigger picture of why Russia is acting do insecure. I would wager its due more to internal than external factors. For instance their terrible life expectancy, crumbling demographics, and crashed educational system. Russia is essentially incompatible with modern service based economy. To adapt much less reverse any of these problems it would take a massive overhaul of Russian society which is not compatible with Putin staying in power. 

Still he has to make something happen because in relative terms Russia's power is shrinking fast. So he has fomented discord in democracies, and as you say relied on hard power. The issue is there's only so much you can do there. This is IMO Putin's greatest blunder due to his background, he very much took the easy route and is now running into a dead end.

It's not a real criticism. You are also free to say fuck Russia in Russia. There are several subjects you can't mention on any US platform, or publicly in EU, and guess what, I won't mention them.

But seriously, there are so far no overwhelming evidence of Russian troops atrocities, hell, I can say there is no evidence at all. All ""evidences"" they provide are either faked videos, like that one video of ""two Russians shooting in the back civilians"", or again that ""Bucha massacre"", which still is the strangest provocation ever done by Ukraine (mayor confirmed Russian troops were outta the city, yet after several days bodies are noticed on the streets; most of the bodies are with white armbands (identification mark for Russian troops or Russia supporters), that one video of Ukrainians where the soldier says ""are we allowed to shoot people without blue armbands?"" and the other replies with ""sure we are"").

In your replies however, you still missed the point of the guy you were replying to. He was trying to prove you that Russian imperialism is better than USA's and pretty much he'd love to live in Russia, and you reply with ""still Russian troops kill civilians"".

Dude, I can definitely say that no Russian would ever kill civilian on purpose. There is no point in doing that. I say that as a Russian person. You wouldn't kill slav if you are a slav and that slav is neutral to you. There is no point to kill civilians aswell just because most Russians are Christians and try not to sin, killing people is the last thing a Christian would do. Heck, even atheists are morally ok in Russia. Doing crimes in war would get you in prison in Russia. 

Do I think Ukrainians are killing civilians on purpose? No, of course not. The only one here killing civilians here are either nationalists from ""Azov"" and ""Aidar"" (for provocation against Russia), or regular soldiers who were obliged to do that by their command (if they don't do that, they are simply killed) (again, for provocation). They do everything the want against civilians, and nobody would investigate it. But civilians all remeber that (tons of videos where civilians say what was done to them by Ukrainian nationalists. Then Ukrainians would say it was done by Russians and everyone would believe them, yet the real bombings of civilians with cluster bombs by Ukrainians are simply forgotten after a day or later or they say that it was done by Russians (even when they are proven wrong because these rockets are used only by Ukrainians).

Optics matter for the west, and yes, that‚Äôs a much more difficult narrative to spin; the 40B would‚Äôve been much harder to get through the American public, and I genuinely don‚Äôt see continental wester Europe providing any military aid at all if Zelensky was the one to declare it, neither the strict sanctions that are harming their own economies.",2022-05-14,up1xmu,i8j0jz3

>A positive void coefficient means that the reactivity increases as the void content inside the reactor increases due to increased boiling or loss of coolant; for example, if the coolant acts predominantly as neutron absorber. This positive void coefficient causes a positive feedback loop, starting with the first occurrence of steam bubbles. This can quickly boil all the coolant in the reactor, if not countered by an (automatic) control mechanism, or if said mechanism's response time is too slow. This happened in the RBMK reactor that was destroyed in the Chernobyl disaster as the automatic control mechanism was mostly disabled (and the operators were trying somewhat recklessly to rapidly restore a high power level. Due to poor control rod design, the operators were unaware that there was a maximal level of neutron poison in the core).",2022-07-02,vp5wie,ieipmlb

thats so weird. during the time, even in electronics people would be aware that higher temp contributes to faster degradation and they had to be cooled, same with motor mechanics, and even physics - that low temp reduces electron activity. why would higher temperature reduce activity - be it radioactive or physical properties? most of things slow down in cooler temperatures, right? or is it different with reactors?",2022-07-02,vp5wie,iekjlr9

4101,"Great question! 

Many nuclear reactors work by creating neutrons through nuclear fission. These neutrons interact with a moderator that flows through the core. By interact I mean they impart their energy on the molecules that make up the moderator. This heats up the moderator which can then be used to create steam in a steam generating system which can turn turbines to create electricity. This also results in more neutrons returning to interact with the fuel which causes more fissions and produces more high energy neutrons. If that doesn't make sense, think of it as the neutrons leaving the fuel, bouncing off of the water molecules, and going straight back into the fuel. I'm specifically describing the function of pressurized water reactors because that's what I have experience with. 

As the temperature of water changes, its density changes as well. If it heats up, it becomes less dense -> more space between the water molecules. This results in less neutrons imparting their energy on water molecules and less neutrons ""bouncing"" back into the fuel which results in fewer fissions. The vise versa is true with cold water. Greater density means more neutrons returning to the fuel to cause more fissions resulting in an increase in reactivity. 

This makes reactors with a negative Œ±T ""inherently stable"" because a slight decrease in temp will cause an increase in reactivity. This will result in temperature increasing due to more fissions occurring and reactivity in turn decreasing. That's only during normal operations though. A rapid introduction of cold water could still result in an uncontrollable increase in reactivity and cold water casualties could still result in a core melt down if no automatic safety or operator action was taken. 

I'm not a nuclear physicist by any standard so I hope that makes sense.",2022-07-02,vp5wie,iekpy3x

Corruption is absolutely everywhere. It's literally a feudalistic system where >90% of the people are slaves with no hope of ever becoming free. It's all a huge piece of garbage.

Ukraine is one step better off and recently started to actively improve and become a civilized, modern, European country with a strong and free middle class, decreasing corruption and improving standards of living. That is why russians are so envious of Ukraine. They hate that the ukrainians are now living better than them. So that is why they have decided to destroy Ukraine and drag it down to their own level, or even beyond. And destroy the Ukrainan culture, language and nation as well, because those remind them to the fact that their country is inferior to Ukraine. 

I think Russia will not succed in destroying Ukraine. On the contrary. Russia will get destroyed and dismantled even more, like the Soviet Union was.

I don't know, but **Wikipedia says**:





Masculinity (also called manhood or manliness) is a set of attributes, behaviors, and roles associated with men and boys. Masculinity can be understood as socially constructed, and there is also evidence that some behaviors considered masculine are influenced by both cultural factors and biological factors. To what extent masculinity is biologically or socially influenced is subject to debate. It is distinct from the definition of the biological male sex, as anyone can exhibit masculine traits. Standards of masculinity vary across different cultures and historical periods.

Europe isn't ready yet to contribute much more, and I believe they will. They see how much of a threat Russia is now, which is exactly why they'll be hesitant to part with much more of their stocks: they're hedging their bets against Russia winning until their own military industries can get into gear.

The real onus is on the US here, who I think should be doing more. There's something like 500 MLRS and close to 500 M109 Paladins in storage...why aren't we sending more of those? There are legitimate reasons to not send over Abrahms tanks I understand now, but I don't think those same reasons apply to the MLRS and self-propelled artillery we got in storage.

For the record, I have mad respect for countries like Slovakia, Poland, and the Balts for standing up to the Russians as much as they have.

To be fair, Poland does expect an upgrade in the form of Leopard 2's from Germany for that, same as with the ring swap involving the Czech Republic.

The explanation for not sending more PzH2000 was that the others are needed to fulfill NATO obligations. In terms of risk, it's not like either Poland or Germany stand alone; if push comes to shove, the entirety of the EU is at war one way or the other.

From reputable russia analysts, like Michael Kofman or Konrad Muzyka we know that Russia will not be able to perform major military operations for the next few years, their estimates range from 3 years to seven-ish, depending on lifting of sanctions, general mobilization and post-conflict approach to rearmament.

Poland is on the frontline, with no NATO allies between it and Russia, with two land borders to Russia (Kaliningrad and Belarus) and has to perform a QRF duty to the baltic states. At the same time, it found it reasonable to create a large gap in its capabilities. Other states, who simply do not have those concerns, can essentially leave themselves significantly disarmed if they wanted to. I'm talking about France, or Spain, or Italy, or a number of smaller countries. There's simply no risk in the coming years.

Germany has the time, money and expertise to literally send all it's PzH2k, scrap all the parts in storage and bomb the factory, then rebuild that manufacturing capability from the ground up, before first PzH2k come back for servicing. By the time Russia would be ready for another operation the fleet would be back in play. Obviously this is idiotic and I'm just writing it to insist on how good the german position is at the moment.

Concerns about German power was a real issue when the Wall fell. Back then, Germany still hadn't regained full sovereignty and needed the Allies' approval for reunification. Thatcher rather openly opposed, and famously said ""I love Germany so much I'm glad there are two of them."" Mitterand apparently wasn't entirely comfortable with the idea, either. You can read a short paragraph with some choice quotes of the two [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_reunification#Britain_and_France), if you can't imagine this having been a concern not too long ago. It's no coincidence that this was when Bundeswehr's decline began.

When their own strategists are saying something akin to, ""Hey, we're kinda fucked"", and then a war pops up on your borders, do you think politicians are going to be more or less likely to send over military kit when they already have so little? 

Again, hedging their bets. I don't agree with it, but it also seems to be a part of their calculus.

4536,"I guess whether this was a long time ago is a matter of perspective, but (West-) Germany's position in (Western) Europe was quite similar to that of Germany today, with France and Germany being an iconic duo and all that. The German military used to be much larger due to the Cold War, but if anything, pacifism used to be much stronger in Germany. I still remember how German participation in *unarmed* UN peacekeeping missions was a hot political topic. Armed missions during the breakup of Yugoslavia a few years later broke a political taboo, and caused a major domestic backlash. If Germany had reinvested into its military in, say, 2000, it would have seemed to confirm the worst fears people had when it Reunified.  
In Europe, there weren't any complaints about German under-investment into its military before Russia occupied Crimea. And that was in the middle of the Eurozone's Sovereign Debt Crisis, hardly a great time to increase the defense budget, hopefully obviously a very recent time.

In any case, maybe nobody is scared of Germany starting another world war *today*, but it's not ridiculous at all to say that such fears existed at the time when Germany reduced the size of its military thirty years ago, and they certainly didn't vanish over night, either.

4811,"Just a heads up, the raw income number on fossil fuels is *much* higher than what's going to the war:

1. Remove what cost you incurr from shipping fuels. Judging by Gazproms public numbers that's about 80%. This number assumes there's no interest payments going on (due to Russias warm relationship with global finance), and ignores all non operational parts of business.

2. From the remaining 20% not everything goes towards Russia. **Very roughly** estimated, Gazprom pays somewhere around 15% taxes. Add to that that it directly owns just about half of Gazprom, and again assuming Gazprom is a perfectly average example of the entire sector, Russia receives only about 57% from those 20%

3. Russias defense expenditure was at somewhere around 10%. Assuming that doubled due to the war, what's arriving at Russia's defence ministry is only 20% of the 57% of the 20%.

4. Corruption is another definite factor over there. Good numbers are impossible to come by, I've seen estimates ranging from 10-90%. Remove that from the total.

it would not break EU economy, it would incentivise saving the ressource and increase demand for competiting oil/gas.

and all the money form the tax would negate the advantage russian get form this business because 15-20% is likely about as much as they can extract to finance their military..

Ukraine will be able to buy whatever equipement they think is best and not rely on donations (slow and unreliable, my understanding only a small share of the military help has been delivered)

There are two target dimensions to any tax: to shape behaviour and to generate revenue.

We are currently in a global energy shortage (Russia helped exacerbate this, but isn't the only cause^(ie orcs got lucky with their timing)). As a result, sellers can effectively dictate prices. For the EU there is no alternative supply available at the moment. As a result, you can't shape behaviour away from Russian energy, as there simply is no alternative in the short term.

This also means that any tax would simply be added to the end price EU consumers would have to pay, not costing Russia a dime.

-------------

>Ukraine will be able to buy whatever equipement they think is best and not rely on donations (slow and unreliable, my understanding only a small share of the military help has been delivered)

There are a few points to unpack here, revolving around what you mean when you say only a small portion has been delivered?

What Ukraine requested? What the western world is in the process of checking feasibility? What has actually been promised? 

Those have unfortunately been thrown together by alot of journalists with more enthusiasm than brain. We have several limitations here of what can be sent when. To start with the western military side: European armies are not on a war footing. Meaning they have comparatively very little combat ready equipment. 

 Judging by the official list, Germany has sent, or is in the process of sending, pretty much every light weapon in the country that hasn't been issued to a specific soldier (I'll have to ignore other armies here, since I don't know enough about them).

On heavy weapons, besides the agreement not to send specific in service contact line material like tanks, we largely have two issues:

First off, we can't actually bring all that much into Ukraine. Harbour and airports are closed and street capacity is comparatively tiny, meaning everything has to be shipped by rail, which is largely limited by having to retool to a different rail gauges between Poland and Ukraine. There is a limit of how much can come in per unit of time and weapons are in rivalry with things like ammo, medicine and other humanitarian aid that also needs freight spots.

Second, heavy system actually involve a lot more than just the vehicle I'm question. Building a unit that can use them effectively does take sometimes years even when starting with well trained soldiers. You will have issues when first adapting and alot of these issues will be specific to your specific country. The reason why even proven equipment is always introduced peacemeal in all armies across the globe is precisely that to find the kinks in the system and your whole organisation. And be it just that a specific type of screw isn't commonly used in your country and no shop has the required screwdrivers or that the cleaning agent xy is attacking the specific material your rubber seals use.

Then there also is the issue of multinational coproductions always having had restrictions that have served in preventing a country going rouge but are now biting us in the butt (-->Gepard saga).

On the side of the industry (excluding the US, which is both sitting on large stockpiles and keeping its lines running precisely due to this) heavy military equipment is an artisan good, for which production lines aren't kept open without specific orders. Meaning it takes somewhere between 24-36 Months between a placed order and the first shipment of the batch. This number comes from the German General in charge of reporting on the war directly, as stated yesterday on ""Nachgefragt"" on YouTube. If the auto translated subtitles are any good I'd strongly recommend watching, there is a lot of detail given.

To bring my rambling to a conclusion, everything together means that equipping Ukraine with heavy weapons is actually pretty damn difficult, meaning supply will be comparatively slow no matter which way around you take.",2022-07-02,vpm7nn,iekyrou

It will.
By making Russian gas less attractive and therefore increasing demand form alternative source.

other alternative source will then invest to increase their production (suddendly they have a competitive advantage) and EU user will restrict their usage in reaction to price.

* **‚ÄúFor the rejection of the world‚Äôs third largest nuclear potential, Ukraine received security guarantees. We do not have those weapons, there is no security either.** There is no part of the territory of our state, and most importantly, there are no millions of our citizens,‚Äù Zelensky said.
* According to Zelesnky, Ukraine demands to move from a policy of appeasement to ensuring security and peace guarantees in Ukraine.
* Zelensky noted that he instructed the Foreign Ministry to convene a summit of the countries participating in the Budapest Memorandum, and if **it does not take place or does not provide Ukraine with security guarantees, it will be recognized by Kiev as invalid along with the clauses signed in 1994.**

The Budapest Memorandum:

>*The Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances refers to three identical political agreements signed at the OSCE conference in Budapest, Hungary on 5 December 1994 to provide* ***security assurances by its signatories relating to the accession of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.*** *The memorandum was originally signed by three nuclear powers: the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States. China and France gave somewhat weaker individual assurances in separate documents.\[1\]*  
>  
>***The memorandum included security assurances against threats or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan.***  
>  
>***As a result, between 1994 and 1996, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine gave up their nuclear weapons.***

* Given the fact that all previous attempts to accuse Ukraine of violating agreements failed, the RF leadership is considering the possibility of organizing a terrorist attack in the so-called DPR and LPR, which would create a pretext for an attack, the so-called ""casus belli""

5337,"ANYWHERE YOU turn in Moscow, it's easy to find members of the Russian elite who wonder why the West thinks that war in Ukraine is the Kremlin‚Äôs preferred course of action. Even if the Russian army managed to force Kyiv into a swift and humiliating defeat without too many casualties, the damage to Russia‚Äôs national interests would surely outweigh any potential military gains.

The problem is that the same logic was just as true eight years ago when the fateful decisions were made to annex Crimea and to stir conflict in Ukraine‚Äôs Donbas region. The fact that Russia has been able to endure the international fallout for all these years helps to explain why the region finds itself again on the brink of war.

When it comes to Ukraine, people in Moscow and the West can be forgiven for assuming that the Kremlin‚Äôs policy is informed by a dispassionate strategy derived from endless hours of interagency debate and the weighing of pros and cons. What actually drives the Kremlin are the tough ideas and interests of a small group of longtime lieutenants to President Vladimir Putin, as well as those of the Russian leader himself. Emboldened by perceptions of the West‚Äôs terminal decline, no one in this group loses much sleep about the prospect of an open-ended confrontation with America and Europe. In fact, the core members of this group would all be among the main beneficiaries of a deeper schism.

Consider Mr Putin‚Äôs war cabinet, which is the locus of most decision-making. It consists of Nikolai Patrushev, the head of the Security Council; Alexander Bortnikov, the head of the FSB (the main successor agency of the KGB intelligence service); Sergei Naryshkin, the head of Russian Foreign Intelligence Service; and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu. Their average age is 68 years old and they have a lot in common. The collapse of the Soviet Union, which Mr Putin famously described as the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century, was the defining episode of their adult lives. Four out of five have a KGB background, with three, including the president himself, coming from the ranks of counterintelligence. It is these hardened men, not polished diplomats like Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who run the country‚Äôs foreign policy.

In recent years members of this group have become very vocal. Messrs Patrushev and Naryshkin frequently give lengthy interviews articulating their views on global developments and Russia‚Äôs international role. According to them, the American-led order is in deep crisis thanks to the failure of Western democracy and internal conflicts spurred by the promotion of tolerance, multiculturalism and respect for the rights of minorities. A new multipolar order is taking shape that reflects an unstoppable shift in power to authoritarian regimes that support traditional values. A feisty, resurgent Russia is a pioneering force behind the arrival of this new order, along with a rising China. Given the state of affairs in western countries, the pair contend, it's only natural that they seek to contain Russia and to install pro-Western regimes in former Soviet republics. The West‚Äôs ultimate goal of a colour revolution in Russia itself would lead to the country‚Äôs conclusive collapse.

Washington sees unfinished business in Russia‚Äôs persistence and success, according to Mr Putin‚Äôs entourage. As America‚Äôs power wanes, its methods are becoming more aggressive. This is why the West cannot be trusted. The best way to ensure the safety of Russia‚Äôs existing political regime and to advance its national interests is to keep America off balance.

Seen this way, Ukraine is the central battleground of the struggle. The stakes could not be higher. Should Moscow allow that country to be fully absorbed into a western sphere of influence, Russia‚Äôs endurance as a great power will itself be under threat. On a personal level, the world view of the hard men is an odd amalgam of Soviet nostalgia, great-power chauvinism and the trappings of the Russian Orthodox faith. The fact that the new elite in Kyiv glorifies the Ukrainian nationalists of the 20th century and thumb their noses at Moscow is a huge personal affront.

Why then are the people around Putin not scared about possible fallout from a new round of far-reaching economic sanctions? In their eyes, the sanctions that the West imposed to punish Russia for the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas were intended largely to check Russia‚Äôs rise. America and its allies would have found a way to introduce them one way or another, they were just looking for an excuse. Since 2014 such views have solidified. Messrs Patrushev, Bortnikov and Naryshkin all find themselves on the U.S. Treasury‚Äôs blacklist already, along with many other members of Mr Putin‚Äôs inner circle. There is no way back for them to the West‚Äôs creature comforts. They are destined to end their lives in Fortress Russia, with their assets and their relatives alongside them.

As for sanctions by sector, including those that President Joe Biden‚Äôs team plans to impose should Russia invade Ukraine, these may end up largely strengthening the hard men‚Äôs grip on the national economy. Import substitution efforts have generated large flows of budget funds that are controlled by the coterie and their proxies, including through Rostec. The massive state conglomerate is run by a friend of Mr Putin‚Äôs from his KGB days in East Germany, Sergey Chemezov. In a similar vein, a ban on food imports from countries that have sanctioned Russia has led to spectacular growth in Russian agribusiness. The sector is overseen by Mr Patrushev‚Äôs elder son Dmitry, who is Mr Putin‚Äôs agriculture minister.

Similarly much-touted financial sanctions have led to a bigger role for state-owned banks which, unsurprisingly enough, are also filled with KGB veterans. If anything, further sanctions wouldn‚Äôt just fail to hurt Mr Putin‚Äôs war cabinet, they would secure its members' place as the top beneficiaries of Russia‚Äôs deepening economic autarky. The same logic is true of domestic politics: as the country descends into a near-permanent state of siege, the security services will be the most important pillar of the regime. That further cements the hard men‚Äôs grip on the country.

After two years of covid-induced self-isolation for Kremlin bosses, there is a clear tendency toward tunnel vision and a dearth of checks and balances. Russia‚Äôs interests are increasingly becoming conflated with the personal interests of the people at the very top of the system.",2022-02-19,swb4mv,hxleblx

Russia sees Ukraine as a former client state which broke free of their control.  They are supporting the separatist movements in eastern ukraine (also home to much of Ukraine's industry).  Russia also invaded Ukraine an seized the Crimean peninsula in 2014.  

Expectations are that Russia will recognize the 'independence' of the separatist regions and potentially absorb them into russia, or establish them as semi-autonomous nations similar to Belarus.   At the minimum this would cripple Ukraine financially and effectively neuter them as a country.  (The West of Ukraine is highly agrarian and not competitively economically).   It is also possible that Russia will seize the rest of the land surrounding Mauripol and cutoff Ukraine from the Black Sea.  A landlocked Ukraine with the Eastern regions removed would basically be a financially strapped country ripe for easy manipulation via corruption, restriction of access to ports, etc.",2022-02-19,swb4mv,hxm9kii

Just straight-up invading, unprovoked, with no workable justification in place, with the eyes of the world on him, and the entire western world telling him don't fucking do it.

Excerpt: 

> When I returned for dissertation research in 2012, the default language was still Russian. Whenever I told people that my Ukrainian was stronger than my Russian, though, most people switched to Ukrainian. This was especially so with young people, who had mostly been educated in Ukrainian after 1991 (before 1989, Ukrainian-language schools were quite rare in the city). They chatted and cursed in Russian, but when I asked if they spoke Ukrainian, their beautiful...... slightly formal Ukrainian would come out. ""Of course! We learned it in school! We are Ukrainian citizens, and no one speaks Ukrainian better than Kharkivites!"" And of course no one in Ukraine spoke more idiomatic, sarcastic, and hilarious Russian, either.

[...]

> A new war would prove quite different from past Russian offensives during the summer of 2014 and winter 2015. Those battles resulted in the Minsk I and II ceasefires, imposed on Ukraine at gunpoint, but the deals are widely acknowledged in Moscow to have been failures that did not achieve Russia‚Äôs political aims. Repeating such operations‚Äîlimited wars to coerce Ukraine into a deal‚Äîwould come at great economic cost in exchange for no tangible benefit. Ukraine‚Äôs armed forces have improved and expanded considerably since 2014. A smaller war confined to the Donbas would incur higher casualties today, without good prospects for achieving any political objectives. If Russia seeks a quick and decisive victory, it will therefore have to dramatically expand the scope of the conflict‚Äîand the types of forces employed.


> Russia has positioned more than 150,000 troops to surround Ukraine from Belarus in the north to Crimea in the south. Together with Russian-led forces in the Donbas, and auxiliaries including Rosgvardia, Russia‚Äôs national guard, this figure may exceed 190,000. These ground forces are supported by hundreds of tactical aircraft, forward-deployed attack helicopters and the Russian navy. This is not a force for a limited campaign, but one designed to pursue maximalist political aims. Russia will seek to surround and isolate Ukrainian forces in pockets of territory, forcing them to surrender, and attempt to impose regime change in Kyiv.


> The Russian disposition of forces suggests that its general staff intends to conduct two major pincer movements into Ukraine. The lesser of the two will advance from the north on the capital, Kyiv. The larger attack will seek to encircle Ukrainian forces near Donbas. Russian-led units there may serve as a pinning force, while the main Russian grouping would advance from the north-east by Kharkiv and from Crimea in the south. In this scenario, Moscow would try to prevent Ukrainian forces from being able to conduct an organised retreat to more defensible terrain west of the Dnieper river.


> This war would begin with air strikes, missile strikes and use of electronic warfare and cyber-attacks. Their goal would be to degrade, fragment and paralyse the Ukrainian armed forces along with its political leadership. This air campaign would be brief, followed by a combined arms ground offensive. Russia‚Äôs ground force is an artillery army with tanks and mechanised infantry. It emphasises decisive use of firepower. These formations would be backed by attack helicopters, tactical bombers and missile brigades. Those supporting elements would dramatically increase the effectiveness of Russian ground formations in combat.


> Although Ukraine‚Äôs armed forces have improved since the fighting of 2014-2015, so have Russia‚Äôs. The units surrounding Ukraine are largely staffed by contract soldiers‚Äîprofessional servicemen, rather than conscripts‚Äîwith high levels of readiness, modernised equipment and officers bloodied in several conflicts, such as the war in Syria. Ukraine‚Äôs military is understaffed, poorly supplied, and inexperienced in manoeuvre warfare. Russian forces therefore have considerable quantitative and qualitative superiority.


> Much is contingent in war, but Ukraine‚Äôs odds are grim in a conventional fight, even with Western-supplied weapons. Its forces might convert into partisan warfare, or take to the cities. The latter would prove a difficult decision as urban warfare is immensely destructive. Moscow probably hopes to organise local security forces, or to co-opt political elites, to avoid being dragged into urban combat. The current Russian force may be enough to occupy Ukraine‚Äôs eastern regions and the capital, but if Russian leaders believe they can control large parts of the country, they are likely to be walking into a sustained insurgency.


> Although Moscow has the military advantage, Russian pronouncements on Ukraine suggest that the Kremlin suffers from a high degree of war optimism‚Äîa common mistake made by aggressors throughout history. These conflicts tend to drag on well beyond the initial campaign, or escalate into regional wars. America‚Äôs experience in Iraq was hardly an aberration. Using force is always a gamble.

> If Russia tries to conduct regime change, it will likely try to install someone who would reach out to elites in other cities. But if Russian forces go into cities, a lot of civilians could die. That would only increase resistance and make conflict termination more difficult.

> The big question is whether Russia can translate the use of military force into achieving its political goals and what will it do if it can't? A Russian invasion now would be an attempt to achieve what 2014-2015 failed to do, so more force is likely and compromise is less likely.

> Moscow says it is effectively at war with NATO - and has warned that Western weapons are inflaming the conflict in Ukraine.

> Speaking on the 61st day of the war, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said continual deliveries of supplies and weaponry to Ukraine means the NATO alliance has positioned itself as &quot;In essence engaged in war with Russia&quot;.

Not only that, Putin has shown his hand and gone all in on tyranny. Now no one can pretend they don't see what he really is - except of course those people that are the same kind, and now we can see who they are too.

6748,"I don't know about the other Western European powers. France, maybe, Britain holds up in a coalition with a water channel between them and Russia. But Western Europe has spent the last three decades disarming itself, like much of the West. 

Ukraine is holding up, after 8 years of preparation, training and as much armament as they could sneak under the nose of a nuclear power. The Ukrainian Army had 135 000 active ground troops at the outbreak of war, and 900 000 reservists.

Germany's entire Armed Forces has 183 000 troops, 15 000 reserves. 65000 of that is the Army. 27 000 in a logistics support service branch. 

The French are sitting at 208 000, with 35 000 reserves. 118 000 of that is the Army. 

Britain has 194 000, 37 000 reserves. 86 000 in the Army.

Those are the three biggest Western European powers. Germany, France, and Britain combine for less than 800 000 total troops. Honestly it is wonderful from a philosophical perspective, and if you told a soldier in 1945 those numbers, they'd think it was all worth it.

6749,"I have my doubt. (Not saying you're wrong, you may be right.) 

China has a severe lack of ability to project power and I have doubts about the ability for themselves to sustain their military and how well it's trained. I also have doubts about the quality of the equipment or at least the amount that would be needed to sustain a soldier base of that size.

I think their military may be a show pony.

I lean towards thinking the EU may be the second strongest military force. France actually pulls a lot of weight, toss in Germany who's no slouch and then the combined skills, training and technology of the rest.

If we're excluding the EU because it's a treaty defense force similar to NATO. I lean towards France or India being number 2.

I say this knowing that China outspends and out mans both but France trains and equips their military exceptionally well and works with all NATO and EU countries to maximize skills and they're up on the latest strategies and best practices. I think France and India punch well above their weight and they're almost always in the top 10 military forces anyways.

I say India because they have a very large force, that is reasonably trained with a lot of special forces that are exceptional and they've had a mindset that they may have to invade or be invaded since Pakistan split off. They're trained under the mantra of 'when' rather than 'if'. It's an intangible but I think it's actually important.

2 months ago I would have said U.S., Russia, China but Russia's failures have made me look hard at China and I think they may have some of the same issues but also have a perspective of they never want to get involved in a war so they only need to defend but they don't really need to defend because they have nukes.

This is similar to the UK's defence approach to the Falkland Islands.

1) It relies on good intelligence and a belief that it is necessary to ""pull the trigger"" and commence the operation. We saw with Ukraine that European intelligence was shoddy and actions were delayed so as ""not to antagonise"" Russia even as it completed its own build-up.

2) Without sufficient missile defence Russian strikes could take out the airfields and any pre-positioned equipment sitting in warehouses before NATO soldiers arrive to disperse it. At which point you're back to racing to the Suwalki Gap.

Because economic ties between Russia and UK is only money laundering, not an actual energy market that they depend on. Shell/BP still buy Russian oil, tho.

It also isn't recent. UK and Russia were competitors since Empire times. Churchill wanted to invade USSR right after WW2, etc.

UK however just like Russia pretty much paper tigers. 

Yeah, Russia wrecking Ukraine and it could've been in my opinion avoided if only all parties actually worked on mutual solution and not shitface diplomacy, but expecting any kind of high class diplomacy since 90s is kinda naive, i guess, but Russia can't hold Ukraine. Simply no military personal and % of Ukrainians that would align with Russians are lower than those that won't.

UK on the other hand may support Ukraine publicly and with credits, but i doubt they military capable of active fight against Russia. IIRC Naval Battleship gone to repair after 4 years in port?

Majority of the countries that invaded ME were fighting locals that were far behind in tech and Ukraine-Russia conflict is the first conflict of more or less equal combatants. Considering that Russians started with the idea that they will capture Kiev and Zelensky will flee and not with the idea of actual full on attack destruction plan that US utilized in Iraq - we can't really be sure what would've happened if preparations were better.

Air superiority is crucial, but without land forces it can't win wars against a relatively modern army.

If you're a NATO defense planner right now, your #1 priority is how to avoid the Baltics becoming Donetsk/Luhansk -- once the enemy has a foothold there, it's not a guarantee that you'll be able to dislodge them. 

The traditional doctrine is ""we put a bunch of NATO tripwires there, so if they try anything, you have dead Americans and a direct confrontation between US/UK and Russia"". But I think that plan of ""we only call in the cavalry if something goes wrong"" is being rethought now, because what it implies is that the Baltic would have to be ceded and then retaken, and it's not a certainty that they'd be able to be retaken. So what you really want is never to have to retreat out of them at all.

Everyone has had ""a presence"" for years in eastern countries as part of NATO's eFP. The US often led troops in Romania and various NATO countries have rotated in the past, including France, with the warship patrols in the Black Sea and the air policing you're talking about. France took the lead there this year.

I don't think we've got anything similar in Estonia for example) and the increase of forces, all of those to be permanently stationed in Romania does actually show a high level of commitment.

> Likewise the UK's battlegroup in Estonia has been there for almost a decade already (although recently increased in scope). It's not just 'more media attention'. 

The UK-led (Operation Cabrit) battlegroup in Estonia is there since 2017 yes. The French contingent (Operation Lynx) in the Baltics belong to this one. It was deployed there in 2017 and has been based there since then just like the UK (beyond the switch to Lithuania for the year 2018 before being back in 2019).

De Gaulle, Monnet, Vansittart, and Pleven quickly agreed to a document proclaiming a joint citizenship, foreign trade, currency, war cabinet, and military command. Churchill withdrew the armistice approval, and at 3 p.m. the War Cabinet met again to consider the union document. Despite the radical nature of the proposal, Churchill and the ministers recognized the need for a dramatic act to encourage the French and reinforce Reynaud's support within his cabinet before it met again at 5pm.[2]

>The final ""Declaration of union"" approved by the British War Cabinet stated that[2]

>France and Great Britain shall no longer be two nations, but one Franco-British Union. The constitution of the Union will provide for joint organs of defence, foreign, financial and economic policies. Every citizen of France will enjoy immediately citizenship of Great Britain, every British subject will become a citizen of France.

>Churchill and De Gaulle called Reynaud to tell him about the document, and they arranged for a joint meeting of the two governments in Concarneau the next day.

Yeah no lol 4 + 2 Vertrag, read up

>>Can you blame them? The US is bombing and murdering civlians from the air base in Ramstein so that makes Germany complicit in war crimes. Not to mention the unjustified Iraq war and tons of other ‚Äûinterventions‚Äú of the US in other countries which were not received well over here

No, I can't blame them - I outright admitted the US played their own part since the early 2000s. One of the *few* problems that I have with modern Germans is that there is this ultra pacifist mindset, the polar opposite of the fascists that preceded us. It's good to have moved away from that but this *ultra* pacifism mentality is an issue. You see it in every bus, at every Bahnhof, in the parking lots, at parties and clubs - these people carry a ""not my problem"" attitude, from women harassed in public to babies left alone in cars. It's good to be rid of fascists but the pendular swing has led to the broad death of civil courage and even standing up for what's right (although they're very capable if it's a social gathering with picket signs about something far away - makes it seem more like cowardice than anything else).

>>From my experience they just fall into the pacifist category, no one wants the DDR back as the ‚Äûgood old days‚Äú.

Then your experience is limited, but at least you're acknowledging it's anecdotal rather than speaking for all of Germany. Given that the East is where the most neo Nazis congregate it's kind of hard to say they're also a bunch of pacifists, something draws them there. If anything the general Art und Weise of
 people out east have seemed more assertive to me, personally, but for obvious reasons had much more Russian than American influence in the last 70 or so years. The money > weapons idealogy doesn't seem as strong in the east.

>>From your sarcasm you seem to disapprove of people criticizing the US killing over a million Iraqi for no reason other than oil control? Average American lol

No, not at all, I think Iraq was a tremendous misstep, I'm just pointing out that it's not hard to play connect the dots with this portion of the population. As I said, America has played its own part. They certainly don't deserve the degree of enmity they get today, though, and the ultra pacifists are very black and white thinkers, there's no acknowledging the good and the bad with the majority of them.

>>Arguably true but there‚Äòs a difference between dismantling and just decreasing the size of the Bundeswehr

Given the status of the Bundeswehr in recent years decreasing its size is functionally dismantling. Not to mention I've heard from more than a couple people that they would like it dismantled, or is ""komplett abbauen"" ambiguous to you? To me it was clear. I do live in an extremely liberal university city, and cannot say I've heard this sentiment elsewhere.

>>True, but most people are anti nowadays

Scroll up, I said Germans in general have a problem with Americans nowadays. The sentiment grew exponentially in the last 20 years, again with the advent of Putin and America's involvement in the middle east.

>>NRW
I'm only familiar with K√∂ln and Dortmund personally, in terms of spending any time there; beautiful area.  Meantime in guessing you're a pacifist rather than an Ossie ;)

>>The few thousands US troops wouldn‚Äòt make a difference, if Putin would attack EU and NATO countries are all required to help defend the attacked country. No to mention, Germany would never be the first target because it‚Äòs in the middle of Europe so there would be enough time to ramp up the military since a conflict like that would last years

35k troops in Germany, about the same number Ukraine started this mess off with but heavily armed and hosting an arsenal of heavy weaponry, more than 1/10 of the current Bundeswehr combat readiness - it would make a difference. I agree Germany would be a strategically impossible first target according to current geopolitical borders, but it just takes one wrong leader in a neighbor country to change that. Personally I'm very thankful Poland has such long standing animosity toward Russia. Not to mention one has to ask how peaceful Europe in general would be if America weren't involved and there were fat, wealthy countries not spending on their militaries, a nonstarter since in that situation *those countries would necessarily spend on their militaries* and the comfy anti military stance we have now wouldn't exist. 

>>But yeah mate you seem to have a lot of hostility towards Germany, doesn‚Äòt seem like the cultural exchange you praised had any effect on you. Still with them exact same rhetoric I see from the average Fox News viewers

Oh no no friend, it's not towards Germany, just towards you. I was acknowledging the two sides of the coin until you started getting hostile towards Americans in comments above. There are (very few) aspects of modern German culture that I dislike, actually I've identified most them in this very comment. Overall I love Germany, but think some pride and patriotism, within reason, would be appropriate, and as far as I can tell there are a lot of Germans, of all colors and backgrounds, even here in my little super liberal city, that feel the same way. No one wants to see red, white, and black flags flying, but it seems most of us are tired for being accused of such when we want to see a black, red, and gold, and there's a trickle down, shame based mentality that belongs to this same line of thought that leads to this ultra pacifism. As to Fox News, I dunno, I haven't seen it since probably 2010 or so. Seems like you're extrapolating to put me into a little box to show how not German I am because you don't like that I represent an opinion different from yours from right here within your country and so you want to invalidate it, but at the same rate I'm not throwing anything at you that I haven't *at least personally* found consensus with among Germans raised here for their whole lives. Und zwar wenn du dich nur mit einem anderen Deutschen unterhalten w√ºrdest, der die gleiche Meinung wie ich hat, h√§ttest du eine andere Begr√ºndung, warum deine Meinung die einzig m√∂gliche ist. Es als ""amerikanisch"" abzutun ist halt faul.

Not really. That was mostly just the invasion of Finland and WWII. 

Russian forces in the French Revolutionary Wars/Napoleonic wars were not excessive. Napoleans invasion army was a similar size to Russian forces, and the French lost due to attrition.

They lost the Crimean War, despite deploying a larger force. They lost the Russo-Japanese war, despite having a significantly larger army compared to Japans. They lost WWI because they did so poorly it triggered a revolution that let the Soviets take control and capitulate to every German condition.

That was also not the case for the Russian Civil war by either the Reds or the Whites. Nor the Polish-Soviet war, which went to a standstill.

As a Finn, I just want to say that if Finland becomes a NATO member state, I hope that Finnish NATO membership will look similar to Norway's in that, that there wont be any nuclear weapons in Finland. I don't think that would serve NATO alliance, either.

It would create even more unnecessary tension. Besides, with nukes, I'm sure there's some difference whether the distance is 250km or 1000 km, but I don't it would be make much difference at that point. Finland is not joining NATO to threaten anyone. That's why I truly hope our membership status will be like with Norway's.  Our military is called *puolustusvoimat* \- a defensive force - much like with Japan's - it's not meant for invasion, but defense. (And guess defense what for, lolz)

At times like these, while I really, really would like all the Russian aggression to stop, I do understand the point that they don't want nukes any closer than there is.

**And I actually sincerely think that's the ONLY REASONABLE THING KREMLIN can ask for. Really.** I'd be really happy, that in 2-5 years from now on, we somehow move on this- and the stance of Russia would be - ""okay fine Finland, be in NATO then - but no nukes! ONLY WE CAN HAZ NUKES ON THE BORDER!!!"" - and that's that. I can live with Russian threat, like Finns have always lived with, as long as it stays only as that. We aren't as insecure as Russia is.

8153,"I don't think NATO is interested in utilizing Finland for that. 

But right now, nothing the Kremlin asks is reasonable because Russia is the aggressor. Everything done here, including joining NATO, is done as a defensive response. When you're the aggressor, you don't get to ask for ""reasonable concessions"" from the people defending themselves from you, and it's important to keep that in perspective.

If Finland had decided to join NATO while Russia was minding its own business, it would be perfectly reasonable for Russia to not want Finland to host nukes. But because Russia has literally driven Finland into NATO's arms while trying to genocide Ukraine, Russia doesn't get to ask anything. That doesn't mean I think Finland should host nukes. But I am telling you to stop viewing anything the Kremlin asks for as ""reasonable"". Everything the Kremlin asks for is designed to give Russia the room to maneuver militarily into its neighbor's lands, it's not a matter of reasonable self-defense. If they cared about reasonable self-defense, they wouldn't have invaded Ukraine or driven Finland into NATO in the first place.

NATO isn't looking to start a nuke war with Russia. NATO is a defensive pact, and it's explicitly designed to *not* allow itself to be used for aggression-- for example, if you're a member of NATO and initiate conflict with another country, the rest of NATO is not obligated to assist you even if the other country attacks back. Your post seems to indicate you think that NATO is an aggressor and that you want Finland's membership to be special and comparatively ""not"" aggressive, but NATO is not and has never been an aggressor, and its membership obligations are designed to prevent the alliance from being used that way.

The European countries that allegedly (I say ""allegedly"" because NATO has never confirmed) host NATO nukes are not aggressors, either. They are Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey. 

Again, it's unlikely Finland would be asked to host nukes. But if they were, they'd be hosting them for the same reason we used to dig moats around a castle and fill them with sharpened pit-spikes. And it would be because we're trying to leverage Russia into backing off, not because we want to initiate a nuclear war with them.",2022-05-14,uppube,i8mvbor

8198,"No nukes need to detonate in a very specific pattern to cause a fission chain reaction. They can still be very dirty radiation bombs though if shot down above a city. 

The chances of stopping a nuclear strike are very slim (unless the US have some uber secret amazing defense tech that no one knows about). 

It's impossible to shoot in the early stages because you'd have to be in very short range when it's launched (most likely in Russia) and that time window is absolutely tiny (~2min). This is why all states announce to governments that they are testing their nuclear launch systems (Russia & China) even to their enemies during wartime. 

You could shoot it in mid-flight but that is also very, very difficult. You have like ~20 minutes (I think) to shoot it down and it releases decoys. One ICBM has something like 40 decoys and 10 warheads. By that point, the defense systems have to correctly identify the real warheads quickly and then hit them dead on with interceptors that have something like 70% chance of hitting. You'd have to shoot four interceptors at 1 warhead just to be sure and have the chances be 99%. And there certainly are not enough interceptors for so many warheads. Not to mention the 526 other ICBMs that could launch from anywhere or the hypersonic nuclear rockets.",2022-05-14,uppube,i8mgd21

Obviously, you can only estimate the direction because the warhead redirects on second stage release, but maybe stop the ICBM or be ready for the release stage? Lastly, what ability do they have to disable or destroy tracked missiles? Obviously they have short range systems with reasonable success. Of course ICBMs are much faster, farther and have additional complications. I'm just wondering what the military has developed in secret for that type of situation. Advanced lasers to malfunction missiles? Always ready defense ships with AEGIS? 5th gen fighter jets or bomber drones with missile defenses? May not be much, but knowing the US military it's not nothing.

You‚Äôd have to be very close to the missile, or have a warning that it was about to be launched. Intercepting mid-flight would be challenging too because of the speed, you‚Äôd need equipment along the pathway to accurately track it to guide the interceptor. And intercepting during the re-entry phase is almost impossible to intercept every weapon, because each missile carries multiple independent warheads. Each warhead can have the same or different targets, and these don‚Äôt even need controlled flight to completely fuck up wherever they‚Äôre going to land. They‚Äôre basically just falling debris, so infrared tracking is difficult, making intercepting more technology dependent and failure prone.",2022-05-15,uppube,i8nkfdu

I don't think that's necessarily true. Obviously a direct hit would basically melt or vapourize a spherical chunk of earth directly around the Ground Zero, but most nukes are set to be airburst weapons to cause as much damage to infrastructure around them as possible.

However, the actual effect on reinforced, nuke-hardened structures may be smaller than you think. There's the famous example of a Centurion tank being left about half a kilometre from a 9.1 kiloton nuclear bomb test (which, granted, is small even for a tactical nuke these days). But the only things wrong with the tank was that the antennae were ripped off, optics were abraded, and the mantlet cover cloth was burned off, but other than that the tank had just ran out of fuel and turned off. That said, if the tank had been crewed, the speculation is that the people inside probably would've been killed by the shockwave - but then again - it's a lot easier to reinforce a bunker or a missile silo, than a tank.",2022-05-15,uppube,i8nf8xq

8357,"True, I would think that's why Russia has been putting nearly all their newer generation ICBMs on mobile platforms, it must give them better odds at avoiding interception. But, i doubt it's a complete solution for them. Mobile systems and nuclear subs have been around for decades and yet both sides have still openly put huge emphasis on securing allies to host missiles and defence systems (see: Cuba, Turkey, Ukraine, the Baltic states, Korea). Proximity and first strike capability has always been a huge part of nuclear strategy for a reason.

Nuclear subs are likely still the retaliatory trump card, given that both the UK and France have moved to rely on them almost exclusively. But, Russia also lacks warm water ports that can access the big oceans in the winter without passing through NATO controlled chokepoints. They're effectively surrounded navally and can't risk relying on them alone. 

So yes sure, MAD still exists. But every time NATO achieves its objectives they chip away at it. That is their absolute number one strategic goal after all. And year by year, [NATO gets more capable](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/usmissiledefense).

The threat of that is why an economically struggling russia has been investing huge in developing and parading about technologies such as the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle and the RS-28 Sarmat ICBM which is supposedly designed to have a shorter boost phase so that it is more difficult to intercept, and partly why they felt pressured to secure a buffer zone through both puppeting Belarus and doing such a reckless and expensive a thing as invading Ukraine.

They operate in a location referred to as 'The Bastion', a ring of islands protected by ASW ships to prevent their tracking and destruction by US attack submarines. Subs aren't invisible, and if enough are located and tailed, they can be wiped out.

This is for their own protection, to get within rapid striking distance of Washington means sailing in waters heavily patrolled by USN Maritime Patrol, Submarine, and Antisubmarine assets. America categorically has better overall acoustic systems and has for some time, and its submarine force is easily the most modernized portion.

The threat to Russia is really stealth aircraft. The F-35 can carry 2 B-61 bombs to any target in combat radius, and they're based in the Baltics and across Poland right now. A low-level stealth attack on Moscow would take them 24 minutes from Vilnius. Assuming they're detected at half that range, that's twelve minutes to react and conduct a launch order. We don't know the relative parity on spotting a fully stealthed F-35. It could well be they would have less than five minutes. 

An Alpha Strike of F-35s targeted at Dead Hand communication launch sites could destroy those ICBMs on launch, preventing failsafe orders from reaching missile silos and submarines.

Putin keeps throwing these threats around because he is *very* desperate. It is entirely possible in his calculus right now that at the moment he suggests conducting a real nuclear war NATO will conduct a coordinated SIOP-style nuclear strike that annihilates the country and leaves it a smoldering ruin in trade for several million Americans and Europeans.

It would most assuredly be the death knell of the governments that launched it, subject to colossal war crimes tribunals, be the resulter of massive cancer increases, possibly collapse the world economy from EMP, and may not even work.

8414,">Why would a nuclear first strike involve 1 or 2 ICBMs 

An extremely high yield, probably 1+ megaton nuclear weapon, acting as an EMP. That‚Äôs quite literally the only reason to open up a full scale first strike with a single ICBM, and that‚Äôs still **extremely** risky, especially with the better technology when compared to previous false alarms in the 20th century. 

In a first strike scenario, the more likely method of attack would be a counter force strike (targeted at the enemy‚Äôs missile fields, submarine bases, early warning sites, command and control bunkers, SAC bases). It would probably work against a country such as North Korea, Pakistan, India, and *maybe* China, but not against a target with massive second strike capability (aka Russia/America)

In a real, active, nuclear exchange, the second the first nuclear weapon is confirmed inbound (for the US that would be the Cobra Dane radar in Shemya, Alaska detecting the ICBM during its cruise phase in LEO, which combined with the thermal bloom of a valid launch would be nearly impossible to be a false alarm), everything that is exposed (ICBMs in silos, nuclear capable aircraft on the ground) is going to be launched, while second strike weapons (SSBNs) will be held in reserve incase counter value (nuking cities to nuke cities) is necessary. 

God I really fucking hope that never happens.",2022-05-15,uppube,i8nmlly
8415,"Because in a case like this, Russia still wouldn't want mutually assured destruction. They could respond to what they claim is a nuclear threat with a ""measured"" nuclear response of a few missiles. Launch 1000 and both sides get wiped off the map. Launch 2 and you make it clear that you intended it and won't hesitate to do it again, while making it likely you only suffer a few being fired back.",2022-05-15,uppube,i8nlu9y

8708,"In my experience (ex-Army, artillery, got out 20+ years ago) 200k rounds is not that much when you consider that Russia is hitting Ukraine with an average of 60k artillery shells/rockets PER DAY:

https://taskandpurpose.com/news/russia-artillery-rocket-strikes-east-ukraine/

With unguided rounds your talking at least 3 rounds (average) to try and ""walk in"" on a target and no decent commander would spend what looks like a a few dozen rounds on that farmland (at least, probably more) to hit a single tank. It would be a waste when your better off going for more strategic targets like ammo depots. 

If it was a guided round that they could do in a single hit, then ""maybe"" I could see it if the tank was heading towards a valuable area but still usually you don't use artillery on a single tank like that. 

Your better saving your artillery rounds for targets that will take out large groups of men/equipment, especially if it will do so through secondary explosions.  

This is one of the reasons why Ukraine has hit so many ammo depots with Artillery, not only do they take out large areas with secondary explosions with minimal use of shells but they also cut off supplies to front line Russian units.",2022-07-03,vprnbw,ienlxvy

8714,"No that's not the reason for Top-Attack munitions.

You can only put so much armour onto a tank or you increase it's weight so much that other factors have to suffer, like mobility, logistics etc. 

You can't bulk up every spot the same and obviously all tank manufacturer decided that the best spot for that limited amound of impactfull protection has to go to the fron. which is logical since you want to engage your enemy from that direction. The sides are also armoured to various degrees but in general the top of a vehicle is the weakest part.

You have to remember that most tanks that are the backbone of most armies today were designed in the 70's to 90's, in a time where top attack wasn't really a thing. Normal ATGM's or in general shaped-charge warhead could be defeated by the composite armour and by ERA which also helped protect the sides of a tank for relatively low weight from those weapons.

Top-Attack was not designed to specificacly detonate Russian style autoloaders but to penetrate the weakspot every tank has by design where also most of the crew is located: The Turret",2022-07-03,vprnbw,ienfne3

""The Russian Federation has announced the closure from next week to October 2021 of part of the Black Sea in the direction of the Kerch Strait for warships and state vessels of other countries under the pretext of military exercises.

 Such actions of the Russian Federation are another attempt in violation of the norms and principles of international law to usurp the sovereign rights of Ukraine as a coastal state, as it is Ukraine that has the rights to regulate navigation in these areas of the Black Sea.

 This step is also a gross violation of the right to freedom of navigation guaranteed by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.  According to the Convention, the Russian Federation must not obstruct or impede transit through the international strait to ports in the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov.

 Against the background of the ongoing increase in its military presence along the border with Ukraine on land, Russia has begun to intensify the escalation at sea.  It transfers warships from the Caspian Sea and strengthens its military potential in the Azov-Black Sea region, and, despite the lack of legal grounds, decided to close this area to warships of other countries, including Ukraine.

 The behavior of the Russian side indicates the absence of any intention on its part to refuse to continue the aggression against Ukraine using military and hybrid methods.

 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine strongly protests against these actions of the Russian Federation and demands the immediate cancellation of the decision to illegally close certain waters of the Black Sea.

 We call on international partners to increase political and diplomatic pressure on the aggressor state in order to cancel the decision to close the waters and stop the escalation in the Azov-Black Sea region.""",2021-04-15,mrh8sa,gum74us

RuSSia wants to occupy Ukraine and/or the geographically important parts to the south and east. It would have been quicker & easier to level an entire city like Mariupol with one atomic WMD than the 2 months of constant shelling and bombing... but nuking something into submission is counterproductive to any plans of setting up shop in the coming decades.   


The wildcard in this current situation is the respect, sympathy, and compassion of innocent people and all human life that Putin obviously lacks. I really think it would take a direct attack on Moscow or other large culturally or militarily important places on RuSSian soil in order for Putin to go all-in on proving how big of a douchebag he is.

Russia doesn‚Äôt need to launch nukes in order to wipe out all life. This is a military power which actively targets civilians and civilian infrastructur, uses cyber warfare to interfere with and extort hospitals and electrical grids, expertly uses infowar to destabilise societies, and suavely bribes politicians in order to get favourable foreign policy. As a sweet maraschino cherry bonus, Russia uses the threat of nukes as a deterrent against bystanders wanting to stop Russia from raping and murdering children. 

Many of Russia‚Äôs nukes probably only exist on paper, the budget having been pocketed years ago, but that‚Äôs somewhat irrelevant cause they do have nukes. But the western powers are probably somewhat able to interdict some of the nukes. Russia has fewer cities of measure, and really the western powers only need to nuke one city in Russia. And in the event Russia nukes the west, the west is more likely to come together to rebuild, whilst Russia, being the belligerent that started this holocaust, won‚Äôt have many friends to call on when they try to rebuild. Russia knows they can‚Äôt survive war with NATO. Russia only demands no further countries join NATO because once those countries do, they effectively become nuclear powers Russia cannot touch.

He might have Lewy Body like Robin Williams. I feel though that if he has Parkinsons and his mind is presently intact then there is little reasons for his inner circle to take him out. 

it has been suggested if he gets Mariupol, and then moves onto Odessa, then there is the Russian enclave in Moldova. Noise has been made that was his intention to take over that territory. That would engage NATO immediately.

He has moved troops in the past years up to the border of the Baltic states and then brought them back. Is he playing chicken?

It seems evident from this disaster in Ukraine that the Russian army is not up to the task. More importantly the work in the background regarding sanctions that include countries like Switzerland implies that for some time powers that be have been reaching out to all to get a united front against Russia or more specifically Putin. Killing Russians in other countries is so offensive. Bill Broder has done a wonderful job to get the Magnitsky Act accepted around the world.

9047,"It's actually a bit different these days, as SLBM's are really the most important part of the ""triad"".  The most dangerous period was earlier in the cold war during the land-based ICBM days.  At that time, the thinking was that the aggressor could land lots of nukes on your silos to soften the blow from a counter-attack, meaning it was necessary to get your nukes off the ground before they were destroyed by your enemy.  These things take about 30 minutes to reach their targets flying over the north pole and would only be detected by radars staring ceaselessly into outer space about 15 minutes before impact, so your entire military apparatus had to be geared to go from zero to all missiles launched in that amount of time.  Literally global destruction on a hair trigger 24/7.  On top of that, guidance systems weren't as accurate so you couldn't guarantee a direct hit, so you'd use monster multi-megaton bombs capable of blasting mile-diameter craters a hundred plus feet into the ground.  Ground bursts like this would be sufficient to collapse any silos within a mile or so from ground zero at each location.

These days, the US, Russian, and British (at the very least) arsenals include something like a thousand nuclear warheads silently cruising beneath ocean waves at random undisclosed locations around the globe, so even if your first strike was effective at eliminating all of the enemy's land-based missiles and bombers, you have to worry about full blown thermonuclear retaliation regardless.  This provides less incentive for a massive early strike and makes putting your strategic forces on a hair trigger less useful.  It's possible for it to turn into a protracted thermonuclear slugfest that slowly escalates and/or de-escalates.",2022-04-29,u7s139,i6nmlu9

Russia is not a superpower. They are failing to take a weak, dismembered and notoriously corrupt country right next door that has 1/10th or less of Russia's conventional forces.

So any nuclear arsenal is only a factor in determining military strength, but will never be sufficient for declaring a nation as a super power.

A superpower denotes something beyond the simple citeria you believe it requires, the posession of nuclear weapons.

The ability to project militry strength globally (US is unmatched). Russia support kleptocratic and other failed state nations that make poor trading partners and less reliable allies. The US operates NATO backstopping security and peace for 70+ years on the European continent. It operates various security pacts with countries such as Australia, Canada and others to promote free trade and the peace and security necessary for global commerce and trade.

The size and resiliency of its economy (US is again unmatched). In this realm only China rivals the United States in terms of the size of the US economy in the near or distant future. Russia is nowhere near either. Its economy rivals that of tiny Italy today, and less given the events of 2014-2022+.

Coupled with its international reach (culture, achievements in science, its cultural exports) here again the US dominates but it is strongly being again challenged by both rivals and friends. 

It is fair to say however that European cooperation (the EU European Space Agency - ESA for example) coupled with that of the United States' NASA has humanity on the actual roadmap to colonization of the solar system. Whereas the Russian space agency is in turmoil, Soyuz as dead-ended as much as the shuttle was. Russia is 20+ years behind and doesn't have the cash to fund development of new heavy lift rockets given sanctions. China is at best 8-10 years behind the US in space technology.",2022-04-20,u7s139,i5iich3
9104,"Nobody disputes that they have nukes, but you're missing the fact that having nukes is not enough to qualify as a superpower. A superpower nation, by definition must have great military, economic, and political power. They're getting their asses handed to them in Ukraine - a much smaller, far less established military. Not exactly demonstrating great military strength. Their economy prior to invading Ukraine had been ranked below that of South Korea (South Korea is not considered a superpower). Now they've been cut off from most of the world economy and are cooking the books to keep afloat. The Russian economy will completely collapse before long. They're no longer going to be in the top 20, which means that they'll be ranked below Poland (currently #20). So definitely doesn't have great economic strength. They've been ostracized in international politics so they really don't qualify as having great political power. They fail on all three metrics that qualify a country as a superpower. Words have meaning. You can't call a nation a superpower simply because they have nukes. Go ahead and say that NATO doesn't want to fight them because they have nukes, just don't call them a superpower. Nobody disagrees with the point that NATO doesn't want to fight them because of the nukes - hell, they've said that themselves. But by the same token, nobody is interested in fighting the nuclear armed countries of Pakistan or North Korea either, but those countries aren't superpowers either.

As for the US not being able to touch them militarily - that's laughable. The number 1 most powerful military in the world is the US air force. The second most powerful military is the US navy. The fourth is the US army aviation and the fifth is the US marine corps. The sixth is India. Now, the third was the Russian air force, but given that they can't achieve air superiority over a nation that ranks 38th and keep having their tanks hauled away by farmers, it seems like they may have slipped a bit. We're using Ukraine as a proxy for military activity right now. The US is pouring a shitload of weapons into Ukraine which helps to weaken Russia. The US doesn't need to engage directly with Russia to get the desired result - that's because the US has power and is able to weaken Russia indirectly because of it. Russia understands that the US is impacting them which is why they sent an official diplomatic notice to stop supporting Ukraine and threatened the US if they didn't stop. The US response? Increased funding and weapons for Ukraine. That's because Russia isn't a threat to the US, despite their nukes. That's because Russia is not a superpower though the US is.",2022-04-21,u7s139,i5kuz20

Even if you focus on nukes as being a source of power, having 6000 or 6 million won't matter. Literally no number of nukes is enough to qualify a country as a superpower because at this point the use of nukes is going to be self defeating as there would be immediate retaliation that wouldn't be survivable; launching nukes today is functionally suicide.

9160,"This unexpected weakness of Russia in military matters arises from four concurring causes, of which three are inherent in her system, and, if not absolutely incurable, are at least little likely to be cured.

In the first place, the nature of the country and the want of roads. Her resources may be vast but they are scattered and remote. Her forces may be immense, but they are necessarily in great measure distant from the scene of action. [‚Ä¶]

Secondly. The Russian armies are often armies on paper only. Not only are their numbers far fewer than are stated in returns and paid for out of the official purse, but they are notoriously ill-provided with everything necessary to the action of a soldier. The colonels of regiments and officers commissariat have a direct interest in having as large a number on the books and as small a number in the field as possible ‚Äî inasmuch as they pocket the pay and rations of the between these figures. They have an interest also in the men being as inadequately fed and clothed as possible ‚Äî inasmuch they pocket the difference between the sum allowed and the sum expended on the soldiers‚Äô rations and accoutrements. The Emperor provides (or believes he does) for the food, clothing, lodging, arms and ammunition of 5 or 600,000 men; but every one of these who is or can be made non-existent is worth two or three hundred roubles to some dishonest official or officer; every pair of shoes or great coat intercepted from the wretched soldier is a bottle of champagne for the ensign or the major; every ammunition waggon which is paid for by Government, but not provided, is a handsome addition to the salary of the captain or the contractor. Robbery and peculation of this sort is universal, in every rank, in every district, in every branch. It runs through every department in the Empire; and its operation upon the efficiency of the military service may be easily imagined and cannot be easily exaggerated.

This horrible and fatal system originates in two sources ‚Äî both, we fear, nearly hopeless, and certainly inherent in Russian autocracy;‚Äî the rooted dishonesty of the national character. and the incurable inadequacy of despotic power. Cheating, bribery, peculation pervade the whole tribe of officials, and are, in fact, the key-note and characteristic of the entire administration. There seems to be no conscience, and not much concealment, about it. The officers are ill paid, and of course pay themselves. Regard for truth or integrity has no part in the Russian character. We have heard those who know them well say that there are only three honest men in the Empire:‚Äî Woronzow is one, Nesselrode another ‚Äî and men differ about the name of the third. We have heard Statesmen, who strongly incline towards a Muscovite alliance, say that the Russians are liars above all things: it is their sp√©cialit√©. Then the power of the Autocrat, absolute as it is and vigorously as it is exercised, is utterly insufficient to meet the evil. What can a despot do who has no instruments that can be trusted? There is no middle class who pay the taxes and insist upon knowing how they are expended. There is no free Press, with its penetrating and omniscient vigilance, to compel honesty and drag offenders to light and retribution. There is only one eye over all: and that eye can of course see only a small corner of this vast Empire. What the Emperor looks at, or can visit, is well done: everything else is neglected or abused. It is the common and inevitable story wherever you have centralisation and barbarism combined.

Thirdly. The common soldiers, brave and hardy as they are, devoted to their Czar, and careless of privation, have no love for their profession, and no interest in the object of the war. If we except the household regiments, who are near the person of the Emperor, the Russian private has no zeal for glory, no taste for fighting, no pleasure in bold and exciting enterprises. He is serf, seized by the conscription, and condemned to hopeless slavery for life. He is torn from his family and his land, drilled by the knout, neglected by his officers, fed on black bread, where fed at all, always without comforts, often without shoes. How can such troops be expected to make head,‚Äî we do not say against French enthusiasm, we do not say against British resolution, we do not say against fanatical and hardy mountaineers, like Schamyl and his warriors, ‚Äî but even against courageous well fed Turks, fighting for their country and their faith, and officered by competent commanders? We need not wonder to read that at Oltenitza and Silistria the Russians had to be on to the assault with menaces and blows; that general had to sacrifice their lives in an unprecedented manner in order to encourage the soldiers to make head against the foe; and that the prisoners of war begged as a mercy to be permitted to enlist in the army that had captured them rather than return to misery by being exchanged.

Lastly. There is another source of weakness in the Russian Empire. That vast State is in a great measure composed of spoils which she has torn from surrounding nations. She is a patchwork of filched and unamalgamated materials. Her frontier provinces are filled with injured, discontented, hostile populations, whom, being unable to reconcile to her rule, she has endeavoured to enfeeble and to crush; and many of whom wait, with more or less of patience and desire, the blessed day of emancipation and revenge. ‚Ä¶ Since the great Roman Empire probably, no State ever enfolded so many bitter enmities within its embrace, or was girt with such a circle of domestic foes.

Now these three last sources of Russian weakness are perennial. They belong to her as a despotism as a centralised administration, as an Empire formed by conquest and unconsolidated and unsecured by conciliation. Until, therefore, her whole system changed; till an honest middle class has been created; till her Government be liberalised and de-centralised; till a free Press be permitted and encouraged to unveil and denounce abuses; and till the rights and feelings of annexed territories be habitually respected, we do not think that Russia need henceforth be considered as formidable for aggression. She has been unmasked; it will be the fault of Europe if it dreads her, or submits to be bullied by her, any longer.

Frankly, this is possible.  Putin started preparing the invasion the moment Trump lost reelection.

Trump DID NOT criticise the 40 billion US aid package (that is left-wing media spin) - what he said, was that ""while the US was sending 40 billion, Europe is not doing their part"".",2022-07-24,w710gt,ihhumct

9202,Could someone post a translation of the article? This sounds misleading,2022-07-24,w710gt,ihi0osn
9203,"I read the linked article. It seems Trump is not ranting against Ukraine aid, but is complaining that the USA, while in large debt itself, is providing much more aid to Ukraine than Europe. He's urging Europe to give more. It seems hardly as described in the post title as a ""rant"", hardly ""against"", and hardly an ""attack"".

Btw, I'm neither American nor European so am not bothered either way. I just thought clarity around it is better than agitprop.",2022-07-24,w710gt,ihi517h
9204,"Why is everyone saying his a russian asset, he literally fucked with russia more than any president since the cold war, and the article is just him talking about the US giving 60 billion to Ukraine while countries in Europe don't give anywhere close to that when this war affects them a lot more than it affects the US",2022-07-24,w710gt,ihi4ura
9205,"Well this is probably the biggest morale booster Putin needed. He's going to hang on now knowing Trump is going to help him win. He's just undone all the good of the sanctions, political isolation and even some of the military support 

Trump is a traitor and quite literally an ENEMY of all Freedom loving, western nations and aspiring democracies. Period. 

McConnell is also a traitor for blocking investigations and protecting him in the senate. They and all the 6 June collaborators in Congress and the Senate are a shit stain on the sacrifices made by generations of America in the War for Independence, Civil War and Wars of the 20th and 21st Centuries. They quite literally have wiped their arse on the Constitution. 

As an Australian, please get Murdoch and Fox/Sky too. Being an enemy propagandist is just as bad - that guy and his idiots like Tucker Carlson are today's Tokyo Rose / Axis Sally for Putin. 

Americans may say, stay out of this as its their country, well this also shits on all the sacrifices of my country fighting against dictators last century too. Allowing a proto-Dictator into the White House is as calamitous as letting Hitler take control from 1933 to 1938. That is an entire world problem.",2022-07-24,w710gt,ihhforv

9207,"We can rant about Trump being a lunatic all we want, but this is an area that concerns me. Despite the rallying call of democracy and freedom that Ukraine has given to the world, the fact remains in America that higher food and fuel prices are eating into the wallets of your average American, the economy is in recession, and as the saying goes, ""its the economy, stupid."" Which means Biden is inevitably headed for political disaster in November and the Dems will likely lose in 2024. In conjunction with whether Europe really is prepared to endure this Winter without Russian gas, Western devotion to the Ukrainian cause is in question. 

So I do fear that Ukraine is now on a time crunch, that they either have to win or shift the momentum in such a way that is irreversible before the political winds blow against them.",2022-07-24,w710gt,ihh622m
9208,"Another example of Reddit being a source of misinformation. 

Trump supports aid to Ukraine, what he‚Äôs upset about is that the US is again carrying the majority of the load. That‚Äôs what he‚Äôs always cared about. He‚Äôs upset that the US is still paying for Europes defense even tho Europe is more than capable of taking care of themselves now. He‚Äôs upset the US is still paying the majority of NATO while rich NATO allies aren‚Äôt even covering their minimum requirements.

The best way to understand Trump is to do something I wouldn‚Äôt recommend to anyone: spend daily life with a clinical grade Narcissist. Not someone a little self-centered whom other people tease about being a little narcissistic. 

Most people have never been around a true, sociopathic narcissist. (Luckily for them). One thing a true narcissist does is they believe the lies coming out of their mouth.

Russia's never been Communist. Lenin tried to make them Communist, but he was too prideful and incompetent. Lenin became a monster and just paved the way for Stalin's regime.

Stalin then turned the USSR away from Lenin's Communist regime towards a State-Capitalist regime. Because he wanted all the money and power.

Stalin then gaslighted the world the same way Putin is trying to now. Stalin projected his capitalist crimes on the west while claiming to be the opposite. Just as Putin projects his Wagner Neo-Nazis, lying, warcrimes, and losses on Ukraine while claiming its a ""Special Military Operation"" that is the paragon of humanitarian aid with only 1500 losses.

Nah, the Communists actually fucking hate Stalinists and Russia both.

George Orwell (Yes, the George Orwell of Animal Farm and 1984) was an Anarcho-Communist who fought in the Spanish Civil War on the side of the SOUM, an Anarcho-Communist group. In the 1930s. Then the Soviet NKVD purged the SOUM.

Animal Farm itself was based off his other work Homage to Catalonia. Homage to Catalonia was a memoir of Orwell's experience in Communist/Socialist communities, a love letter to thise communities, and a scathing hate letter to the NKVD.

Or Nestor Ivanovich Makhno, an Anarcho-Communist who was once a majorly influential political figure in Ukraine. His movement in the 1900s and 1910s once occupied a large area of Ukrainian territory.

Makhno was one of the small number of men to make Anarcho-Communism actually functional for an extended period of time. Communities under his influence even had small Capitalist sectors and the two groups were actually co-existing, doing business, and not constantly out for blood.

Makhno's Black Army took part in Army Russian Civil War against Lenin's Red Army and the tentpole White Army. Lenin stabbed Makhno in the back, purged his movement, and comitted warcrimes against Ukrainians to spite Makhno.

Remnants of Makhno's movement or at least a vengeful grudge on his part still exist today. Such as inthee form of the COAC. The Combat Organization of Anarcho-Communists. The COAC is the group claiming responsibility for most of the partisan sabotage and activity in Russian territory.

Getting revenge for Makhno, aiding his homeland keep independence, and spiting Russia all at once. Anarcho-Communists have been waiting for this chance to fight Russia longer than Americans have. They fucking hate the Russians.",2022-07-24,w710gt,ihhb2rt

I literally called Lenin a monster right after acknowledging that he was trying to install Communism. Lenin was Socialist. Lenin was Communist. He was still a genocidal war criminal and I hope he burns in hell. There was literally no attempt at ""Semantics"" of any word I used anywhere in what I said.

You're just using a canned argument straight out of McCarthyism propaganda. Ya know, the exact propaganda the far-right Americans cling to to keep influence and has gotten them so far that they felt confident enough to attempt a violent coup. With a man guilty of the same incompetence and messiah complex Lenin had at their helm. The man the headline in the OP talks about.

The concept behind Red Scare had reason to fear the USSR, but it was just used as another propaganda tool. An attempt by wannabe-Oligarchs in American to make Americans run so far to the right in fear of the ""Left"" of ""Communist/Socialist"" China/Russia that politicians here could begin stripping all Socialist policies that kept America's government in check. And eventually strip any options for peaceful democracy.

All for the sake of turning America into its own kleptocratic State-Capitalist regime exactly like Russia with themselves at the helm. Why the do you think Russia's so buddy-buddy with with the people trying to do this. The same people who were screeching for Russian blood just 20 years ago? It's because they're the same State-Capitalist ideology.

Again, as I said at the start of this post and at the start of my last post, I am not attempting to justify anything Stalinists or Maoists did. I myself fucking hate both of them. I literally said at the start of this that Lenin was indeed trying to install Communism (unlike the State-Capitalism of Stalin) and he was a fucking monster, too.

You can send me all the canned responses you want. Just like the first one, you won't be responding to, let alone refuting, anything I actually said.

For an actual response to the non-canned things you said:

Yes, Makhno entered a temporary alliance with the Bolsheviks to defeat the White Army. Remember that it was a war of multiple parties? It's like America and Britain teaming up with the USSR to fight Germany. That doesn't mean America and Britain were Stalinist. War is complicated and sometimes you have to make less-than-optimal choices. Just like how Churchill warned of Stalin and the USSR, Makhno still considered Lenin and the Bolsheviks his enemy. Lenin just got the jump on them first.

The Holodomor was one of the greatest genocides of humanity, but don't act like Lenin, (The only actual Leftist between Stalin and Lenin) had anything to do with it. Lenin was exiled years before the Holodomor took place. Instead, you should point to the Great Famine that Lenin caused in the late 1810s and early 1820s.

Simply put, ""F-It"" it looks like the machinist said as he ran the blank on the lathe when they bored the blank out and cut grooves.

Sucky thing for the crew is that one side of the cannon wall is far thinner. As some of their top tanks get pretty spent after about 1500 rounds, who knows what a bump barrells life is.

And that said this barrells life is prolly much less than a perfect Barrell. 

And hopefully they don't get some crappy made rounds that have eyeballed loads that overpressure the bore.

Because when that happens, that thin side is gonna eventually give out catastrophically and hopefully for whoever is shooting it doesn't shoot that pressure anywhere but out the thin wall. Which it should.

But hope.they are  buttoned up and all that.

However given that it's a Russian vehicle, fire away. Have fun and if it goes boom let's all bopemit goes boom on them.

If the Ukrainians we're trolling the Russians, they'd just park this as is and let the Russians ""recapture"" it.

Maybe after they put a crack in that bore so the next shot is it's last.

Or just drop a pin on a GPS fire solution map, park a loitering drone, and wait for a unsuspecting crew to ""find"" the bmp, hop.in, and then let the drone drop some bombs or hopefully by then the artillery rounds are in the air and on the way to the spot.

And Merry Xmas you Z heads. 

Take your shit vehicles back. 

What's crazy is that over the course of this war we are seeing that very very few of Russian made systems are worth a damn.

Some of their planes, some of their missiles, some subs, and some other stuff here and there but the meat or their armed forces vehicles planes and weapons are just either antiquated, poorly made, badly designed, a few of these, and often a bunch of all of these.

As a Russian soldier I'd hope to be put on like a boomer sub because their newer and spendy and a major weapons platform. Or a very, very new 4th/5th generation jet but there's so few of those it's like winning the lotto for that. And theyre not gonna put you in risky engagements.

The only thing the Russians have right now really is tons of artillery pieces and 100s of thousands of rounds.

Daily stats suspect they are shooting upwards of 60,000 rounds of artillery a *day*.

And himars is targeting high value targets. Meetings, ammo dumps, has, concentrated bivouacs, etc. Only time arty pieces will get hit is if they are in high numbers or are really shelling someone from a certain position. I reckon the Z heads are trying to trap the himars by putting a bunch of arty in an area and just telling them to shell for hours.

Hoping that they will get himars to uncover and target that arty.

And then have a counter battery hidden all over, several of them, and as soon as himars launch or drones spot em.. If they can, have those areas dialed in or fire counter arty right away.

Thing is himars can stop and pop and move out before the rockets they launch even hit so to take em out they are going to have the best fire detection suites in the world and who knows if they have anything like that.

Their best bet is a drone spots em and they get some barrages off before the himars move but even then they might get what, 2 or 3 of them if that?

Plus the distance. I just know Russia is baiting them and if you're a high value or large target god hell you because you're the lamb being led to the t-rex.

And they'll sacrifice you to see the himars launch and then try and hit them.

And they might do it but the bait is gonna be just that. Bait. And then, dust. 

But yeah, TL;DR - looks just like what weve come to expect from low speed Russian gear. Poorly made, poorly used, old, antiquated, and eventually trash and heaps of scrap metal for whoever to collect and salvage and recycle.

9788,"Warning: incoming essay:

Contrary to what cs majors might tell you, 100% automated manufacturing is still a pipe dream. People have to load the program to the machine, change out and load tooling, load the blank bar into the machine. Even at beretta, the most automated weapons manufacturer still has people doing setups. And that‚Äôs in a fairly wealthy country like Italy. 

I work in a machine shop in the sillicon valley. And let me tell you, most people in my line of work would slap their cocks on parts for Tesla, spaceX, generic-nda-military industrial company, and aerospace companies, if they knew they wouldn‚Äôt get caught. I can‚Äôt imagine that machinists/operators in Russia are going to be any more put together. Those guys aren‚Äôt being paid dick and might have gone the way of Tesla machine shop employees: drunk or high as fuck while working. 

The serious answer for the technically inclined: You have a clamp for that bar; think of the drill bit holder on your cordless Nikita drill in your workshop. If you open it all the way, and tighten down as fast as you can, you‚Äôll prolly get it caught in between the three jaws that clamp down. It will be cockeyed and off center hanging off to the side. Now picture that but in the realm of being off center .001 inches or .01mm right next to the clamp. Looks straight but isn‚Äôt. We call this runout. As you go farther away (sources tell me it‚Äôs a 95 inch/2400 mm barrel) that runout is only going to get worse. If you drill that runout with a gun drill (a long ass drill with coolant that runs through the middle of the drill attached to something that makes it dead center of that clamp) it will go straight, but the bar isn‚Äôt straight, making this behemoth of a part you see before you. 

Depending on the wall thickness needed for this barrel, it could possibly be saved by using inside diameter workholding and gripping onto the inside bore (which is technically straight) and turning down the outside of the bar.

Once they finish those operations, they run the barrel through the lathe and take it to final exterior dimensions.  

That final step is really easy to fuck up.  The barrel needs to be centered on both ends so you end up with a consistent diameter when you take the exterior to final.  If you just check the rough exterior dimension for round in the lathe or only check one end you will end up with a bore that runs diagonally through the barrel, or you might end up with a bore that it out of center.

There's two very big reasons: Death Star 1 and Death Star 2.  The amount of capital, materials, and labor needed to build them sucked fund from everything else. Durasteel (what Star Destroyers and other ships are made of) prices were skyhigh because the Empire was buying everything up.

9923,"The water leakage was a problem because it destroyed the electronics that rotated the turret forcing manual turret rotation.  It's actually a really, really big deal to keep water out.  Gotta protect your electronics in a tank.

The T34 armor did not have an interior anti-spalling layer like the M4.  This greatly increased the risk of cabin shrapnel from armor hits even when they didn't pierce.  It also had cabin-mounted fuel tanks instead of mounting them outside the crew cabin behind a firewall like the M4.  This led to a far higher crew mortality rate in the T-34.  The high rate of interior shrapnel and lack of firewall between the crew and fuel tanks caused a lot of dead crew from rapidly spreading cabin fires.

This was further exacerbated in the T-34 by its cramped cabin making bailing out a slower process than in the M4.

To explain just how bad survivability was, we don't have numbers from WW2 but we do from the Korean War.  North Korean T-34 crew had an *85% mortality rate* when their tanks were destroyed because they were unable to bail and burned alive.  It's the lowest survival rate of any tank in history.  The M4 had the lowest crew mortality in WW2.  When an M4 was destroyed on average only 15% of the crew died due to the anti-spalling, firewall, and multiple bailing options.

Additionally, even late war T-34 tanks had transmission issues.  Early T-34 tanks had an extremely low to speed of only 8mph due to a frankly awful transmission.  Later models had a much improved transmission that allowed a 15mph speed but it was still a slow medium tank that really couldn't leverage its relatively potent engine.

Also, T-34 reliability was nothing short of abysmal from Soviet reports.  This is partially due to the Red Army's lack of recovery vehicles but in some cases groups would lose 40% of their tanks before encountering combat.  Some armored groups recommended rebuilding the engine if it had run more than 30 hours and an assault was expected.  Conversely, the roughly 4000 M4 tanks provided to the Soviet Union via the Lend-Lease program were praised as being extremely reliable, fast, slow to burn, easy to escape, and with a sufficient if not noteworthy gun.  However, they were noted as being easy to tip over if not careful.

The T-34 gun is an outright tragedy because it's fantastic but in practice had only slightly better penetration than the M4 75mm and worse than the 76mm.  The was due to the ammunition the Red Army issued with it using a low grade of powder because it was cheaper.  The T-34 gun was only marginally better than the early M4 gun and worse than the late M4 gun and that's honestly tragic because it's a really good design.

The T-34 was also extremely loud and while it had a frankly excellent gunnar's sight which made accurate long range shots a breeze its wide angle sight was awful.  So it was largely blind and deaf much of the time.  This was made even worse by it not having a radio phone mount like the M4, so communicating with troops was a nightmare.

The T-34 honestly had a lot of major design flaws.  I don't think it's fair to say it's as good as the M4 which was arguably the best medium tank of the entire war.",2022-07-25,w76f9a,ihizvy7

It would trigger a massive war,yes, but it would take the launching of all capable ICBMs along with the failure of intercept to trigger MAD. The US and other countries all have multiple vectors for intercept at almost all stages of an ICBMs trajectory (excluding boost phase). That is all.

End of what? A city? It's awful, but I mean, two have already gone off in cities and the world keeps on turning. I still agree with your sentiment though, one going off in a decent sized city would cause more causalities than pretty much all wars since Vietnam.",2022-07-24,w76f9a,ihiavxs
9976,"Thats not how ICBMs work.  Russia would need to launch their entire strategic arsenal for it to be effective.  Nuclear launch sites and missile quantities are planned out and coordinated to overwhelm defenses.  There is an expected intercept rate, so enough quantity has to be launched to saturate missile defense systems and still get some through.  If Russia launched only one missile, it would 100% be intercepted before it had time to hurt anyone.  This is why North Korea isnt a real threat either.

Given there has been 40-50 years of weapons progress in the west since Russia actually did anything new, I would guess a 60-70% launch rate would result in 100% intercepts.   The Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System and all the others like it are no joke.  The Russian launch sites, flight paths, and targets have been studied to death.

This is why missile submarines are the crux of nuclear deterrents.  They can be anywhere and are much harder to intercept.  Also why Russia is still trying to hang in the submarine game above all else.

Again, I feel decently confident that US forces have this under control.  Especially right now.  If the ballistic missile subs are mission capable (questionable) I still doubt any of their payload would reach the USA.",2022-07-25,w76f9a,ihiw79z

Now a counteroffensive can become a full fledged offense if the enemy buckles enough.  But normally in a true offensive one is looking to keep what it holds, whereas since March Ukraine has mainly been focused on degrading enemy combat capability and demoralizing the enemy, vs being stuck on holding many of the villages and terrain it enters.

The situation is similar in the north and north east Kharkiv area.  Both sides are patrolling some areas in force, but not being stuck (particularly Ukraine) on holding a village.  Its why places like Ternova ""flip"" back and forth.  Russian move in, Ukraine hits them, russians are destroyed or run, it gets reported, then Ukraine pulls its TDF back as it is extended or exposed if it stays put.",2022-07-24,w728o6,ihhnbim

I believe these ‚Äúfires‚Äù are absolutely the result of the counter offensive.

A lot of critical infrastructure has been hit and people have been forced to leave so it‚Äôs probably a lot harder to have operational fire departments especially in occupied areas compared to 2021. Additionally infrastructure damage and the difficulty of performing basic maintenance may also result in more fires started by downed power lines or other electric issues. In Russia we‚Äôve already seen an increase in wildfires the army was one of the main sources of manpower to fight them and with the Russian army in Ukraine more small towns in Russia are being threatened by fires.

If Putin hasn‚Äôt mobilized then the odds of nuclear warfare are very very low. The second precondition is an adjustment in Russia‚Äôs official nuclear doctrine.

Russia needs troops at their long borders and troops in their major cities and areas, to quell unrest. That was always a given in russias military planning and chunks down on the available material and troops in a extreme way. The stuff is already needed elsewhere.

They can not leave borders unguarded, nor can they use their globally active navy besides what is already in the black sea.

That explains partially, that with even nearly 3 times the size in population, they can not muster easily the same voluntary troop numbers. Russia runs into a problem of their own propaganda at that point.

They claimed that the invasion was a sort of ""police action"", not a war. Their constitution demands that they have to be at war to go full draft. So besides the economic effects, civil unrest consequences would come to bite russia once russia/kreml changed definitions in that regard.

10726,"Can you post those photos, or a link them please?

Why would one need to illuminate the sky/battlefield, of an already illuminated city? Plus, that's not how those flares/ rounds behave.

EDIT: Illumination rounds are falling at a much slower pace than these (I also don't see any hint of a parachute), won't set things on fire, extinguish themselves quicker and  don't break away in such pattern.

The Russians have g2g and a2g rockets/ missiles capable to store incendiary sub munitions, filled with an highly flammable material. 

What I can't tell for sure is what's the nature of that material, since the true colors are being altered by: the phone that was recorded - n times the original video has been encoded and decoded - our displays not being professionally calibrated.  

The thing could be phosphorous, but the initial moment the payload was unloaded is missing, so I can't tell if the reaction was spontaneous the moment it came in contact with oxygen. If it's thermite out of an g2g rocket, then tomorrow will most certainly see other videos/photos of melted small magnesium cases, along with puddles of melted iron covered by aluminum oxide.",2022-07-23,w6e9un,ihds0hk

> Moldova&#039;s prime minister on Sunday said she is &quot;Very worried&quot; about Russia invading her country next, as it makes advances in Ukraine&#039;s east and south, near the Moldova-Ukraine border.

> During the war in Ukraine, Moldova has sheltered around half a million Ukrainian refugees, at one time hosting more refugees per capita than any other country.

> Moldova&#039;s fear of a Russian invasion heightened in March, when a leaked photo showed Putin ally and Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko pointing at Moldova on a battle map.

1. Cause a mass route in Russian conscripts.

2. Show up putin by calling his nuclear bluff and destroy his strongman image for good.

3. Train & equip Ukrainians with NATO gear much faster.

The basic understanding I have of this comes down to one word, logistics. Putin already proved he hadn‚Äôt properly planned the logistics for a possible prolonged battle with Ukraine and it would be nearly impossible for him to drum up the necessary supplies to fight another country while still engaged with Ukraine. Since Ukraine is refusing to back down until all of its territory is returned all of the Russian army is focused there, diverting troupes to start another war would be idiotic as it would immensely weaken the current lines of battle. Putin is very aware of this and knows he can‚Äôt do anything except bluster like a peacock. His only viable option would be to launch nukes but many countries have already stated that if Russia launches nukes they would ensure mutual destruction.

His greatest achievement is simply being quiet and not fuckin up, other than that I don't think we could find anything to praise him for. His biggest achievement comes from internal politics, when he unexpectedly showed up at and presided a government meeting (so he wasn't purely decorative) thus delaying the passage of a government decision to low key legalise corruption, which in turn encouraged people to go out and protest.

A Human Rights Watch report of 1 February 2000 quotes a study made by the US Defense Intelligence Agency:

>	The [blast] kill mechanism against living targets is unique‚Äîand unpleasant. ... What kills is the pressure wave, and more importantly, the subsequent rarefaction [vacuum], which ruptures the lungs. ... If the fuel deflagrates but does not detonate, victims will be severely burned and will probably also inhale the burning fuel. Since the most common FAE fuels, ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, are highly toxic, undetonated FAE should prove as lethal to personnel caught within the cloud as with most chemical agents.

>	Another Defense Intelligence Agency document speculates that, because the ""shock and pressure waves cause minimal damage to brain tissue ... it is possible that victims of FAEs are not rendered unconscious by the blast, but instead suffer for several seconds or minutes while they suffocate""

11741,"Yep. Let's take it to its logical conclusion from the perspective of a decision-maker in the Pentagon. If Ukraine proves it won't fulfill international obligations, then it's reasonable to assume Ukraine won't fulfill other promises.

If there's a reasonable chance that Ukraine won't stick to promises, then there's a non-insignificant chance that Ukraine would use long range HIMARS missiles to strike deep into Russian territory against our wishes. The US would stop providing long-range missiles in any meaningful numbers. That would then kill the trend of the slow but steady American ramping up of providing more and more advanced weaponry.

Lets explore what THAT means. The US started this war absolutely and explicitly ruling out giving jets to Ukrainians as they were seen as offensive weapons... Now, congress [approved Ukrainian pilots to start learning how to pilot F-15s and F-16s](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2022/07/15/house-authorizes-training-for-ukrainian-pilots-to-use-us-aircraft/) and the Pentagon is actually [debating whether we can send those jets directly from us.](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/biden-oks-up-175mln-ukraine-defense-aid-white-house-says-2022-07-22/). To put into context how radical that is, Turkey - a NATO ally member for 70 years - is just now approved to be sold F-15s/16s after [playing hardball with Sweden and Finland application negotiations.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/29/erdogan-gains-from-lifting-sweden-and-finland-nato-veto-with-us-fighter-jet-promise). And this is just for the US. Think about how many European/Canadian allies who are *very* sensitive to international law and diplomacy.

The point being the millisecond Ukraine goofs up the way Russia has, the western-supported Ukrainian rejuvenation project will be in question. There are very real, material, and practical reasons why Ukrainians should think twice about deliberately violating international law. I'd go so far as to say any Ukrainian national being found breaking said international law should be condemned and punished swiftly and publically by the Ukrainian authorities.",2022-07-23,w63v2m,ihck8co

They were outkilled almost 5:1 in that time. Germany was absolutely shitcanning them with less than half of their military.

Ukraine sees this logic, disarms it's arsenal, and then gets raped repeatedly and violently. The rest of the world watches on and learns that _diplomacy means nothing_. _Treaties mean nothing._. We are showing the world that not only are nukes able to hold the entirety of NATO at bay, but that they're the _only_ way to defend your nation. 

_Not only that_, but they are also learning that whenever Big Nations take away your nukes even under fraudulent circumstances, you don't get them back. You get raped and everyone watches throwing money at you.

_How_ do you not grasp how this is _terrible_ for global disarmament? How can you not see what this is teaching the world? 

Its all well and good to stick to our word when it's easy. Now that Russia has shown the planet nukes can hold literally _any_ Army in the world at bay, we have to keep our word when things _don't_ go our way to ensure our word _means_ something, and that countries willing to disarm aren't scared away from the prospect by being raped over and over.",2022-07-24,w6hjqz,ihi82ol

How are can you not grasp that every _other_ nuclear nation thinking of disarming is _watching how Ukraine is being treated_. How can you not fucking understand what this example is showing every other nation? 

Ukraine was _lied to and tricked_ to steal their nukes which would have _entirely_ prevented this entire conflict. The rest of the world is seeing not only how powerful the threat of nukes are, but also how terribly dangerous _dissarming is_. I'll repeat that because you're an idiot. _The world is being shown that disarmament is a terrible option_.

The first thing we have to do is mend our reputation by _giving Ukraine their own nukes back_, a capability they only gave up under false pretense. After faith in our word is restored, then we start the process of disarming once again. 

But as long as Russia is able to hold off all of NATO, the world will be taught _nukes are ultimately the only thing that matters_.

ü™ñ While no major territory changed hands over the weekend the war has subtly shifted in [Ukraine‚Äôs favor](https://twitter.com/JayinKyiv/status/1550914005186781184) as russia, unable to start any new offensives, is dealing with a serious [ammunition shortage](https://twitter.com/georgewbarros/status/1550986253176344576) and a [substantial threat](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1551095330674016256.html) to Kherson. [ISW](https://twitter.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1551364703561162752), and [DefMon](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1551139400142176256.html) covered Sunday's battles. [@Andrew](https://twitter.com/AndrewPerpetua) took the weekend off.

üöß Ukraine struck another bridge in the Kherson Oblast, this one at [Dar‚Äôivka](https://twitter.com/JimmySecUK/status/1550764462130561026) a smaller bridge leading from Kherson to the Dam at Nova Kakhovka.  The [precision of the strikes](https://twitter.com/bhginee/status/1550829704869027841) was, well, really [just showing off](https://twitter.com/Kartinamaslom5/status/1550784588426911744).   Although russia is attempting to build some [pontoon bridges](https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1550888734802984960) and [repair the damaged bridges](https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1551113884676886528), given the precision of Ukrainian weapons, it‚Äôs doubtful pontoon bridges will be much help in the coming battle.  The russians are now [all too aware](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1550733910400811009.html) that their troops in Kherson risk losing their escape routes.

üëâ It looks like the russian forces in Vysokopolye are not yet encircled or [snared in a cauldron](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1550953911778934789), however it does appear russia may have [quite a bit of trouble](https://twitter.com/defmon3/status/1550808094938222597) re-supplying their troops there.  Information on the situation remains sparse and the fog of war, dense.

üåæ It took less than twelve hours for russia to break the agreement it signed on Friday as it launched four caliber cruise misses at the port of Odessa.  While [two were intercepted](https://twitter.com/nexta_tv/status/1550768526557855745), two missiles [struck the port facility](https://twitter.com/Reevellp/status/1550817931059232769) and caused [some damage](https://twitter.com/ianbremmer/status/1550821209352409090). The Adzhigol Lighthouse was also reportedly [targeted and damaged](https://twitter.com/JayinKyiv/status/1550758343119101954).  russia [initially denied](https://twitter.com/DeusExMachinaNP/status/1550933402857209856) they were responsible then claimed they were [targeting Ukrainian missile complexes](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1550955758942126082.html) at the port.  The [UN](https://twitter.com/chitowntoktown/status/1550814329955651589) and the [US strongly condemned](https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1550945908136763392) the attacks.  By breaking such a high profile and brokered agreement, russia has **greatly** undermined its allies in Europe who are arguing for a negotiated cease-fire.  Ukraine has indicated it will [continue to try](https://twitter.com/phildstewart/status/1551058029373702144) to export grain despite the agreement being called into question.

üçÑ There was a [massive explosion](https://twitter.com/ukraine_world/status/1550909530288054277) in occupied Horlivka on Saturday.  And [another](https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1550866719463424003) in Gorlovka in the Donbas.  Also hit were [railway lines](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1551099053940809729) and [military basess](https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1551154575264174085).

üçÑ An incendiary munition exploded over russian controlled Donetsk Sunday morning, [although beautiful](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1550935708432568321.html), the thermite strands [burns at 3,500 degrees](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1521991581615677441.html).  Ukraine doesn‚Äôt  use such munitions so [the theories](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1551181711706316801.html) are a russian warhead prematurely detonated [or malfunctioned](https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1550942361601064961) over the city.   If it was a russian missile malfunction, it would not be [the first](https://twitter.com/TheDeadDistrict/status/1549755252001357824). 

üõ© Ukraine‚Äôs air force [is still alive and kicking](https://twitter.com/tinso_ww/status/1551013077801631744) as russia‚Äôs air defenses in the south are being attritted.  On Sunday a russian [S-300 air defense system](https://twitter.com/ng_ukraine/status/1551229803273101313) was destroyed. Ukraine's air force also destroyed [three russian strongholds](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1551323666457235457), one [SU-25](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1551249700229193728), and [4 russian Caliber](https://twitter.com/Ukrinform_News/status/1551271898582945792) cruise missles.

üëâ In addition to the logistics losses of russian ammo dumps, because of the staggering number of artillery shells used by russia in June, russia is now [dealing with wear](https://twitter.com/MarkHertling/status/1551303935654232066) on their barrels causing [catastrophic failures](https://twitter.com/UAWeapons/status/1551294834027249664) that further limit their ability to carry out actions in the theater.

üí∞The China-russian [joint venture to build a passenger jet is failing](https://twitter.com/Stas70699731/status/1550930275693125634) over disagreements on profit sharing and the use of western technology.

üí∞Because of the war and the state of the Ukrainian economy, ratings analyst Fitch Ratings [downgrades Ukrainian debt](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1550714944458563585) to ‚Äòhigh risk of default‚Äô from C to CCC, forecasting Ukraine‚Äôs economy will shrink 33% in 2022.  This action will make it harder for Ukraine to borrow money and increase the cost of doing so.

üéÅ Outgoing UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson put up [a video](https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1550774036136878082) of Ukrainian troops being trained in the UK.  Surprisingly, the royal navy is also training [Ukrainian sailors](https://twitter.com/UKDefJournal/status/1550443097569599491) to undertake mine-sweeping duties as the UK is donating two decommissioned [mine-sweeping vessels](https://twitter.com/SirBrit_/status/1550440279064412162) to Ukraine.

üéÅ President Biden has [$6 billion dollars](https://twitter.com/JackDetsch/status/1550572376475197442) left in presidential drawdown authority to spend before the end of the fiscal year in September.  This authority is different than the $20 billion in military aid congress approved earlier in the year.  The US also posted [a list](https://twitter.com/Militarylandnet/status/1551292591077036033) of all the military aid it has provided to Ukraine since the war began, a total value of around 7.6 billion dollars.

üá©üá™ German Chancellor Olaf Scholz [delays the delivery](https://twitter.com/TpyxaNews/status/1550916396032352257) of 11 IRIS-T air defense systems.  Kyiv wanted to purchase directly from the manufacturer, but the German government is delaying the approval process.   In other news, Poland is accusing Germany of [failing to honor its promise](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1550827538292817921) to replace tanks Poland donated to Ukraine with modern analogs.

üî• The EU is making successful strides weening itself off russian oil and Saudi Arabia and Iraq are rushing in to make up the difference, [increasing exports by 90%](https://twitter.com/muusekiimiko/status/1551022058863214594).  Japan is also successfully ridding itself of russian [oil and coal](https://twitter.com/carloseats/status/1550636200574287873).

üì∞ As if these daily summaries weren‚Äôt massive enough, the New York Times [has opened an office](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1550760587633852419) in Ukraine to cover the war although there is some question on [how neutral](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1550922995618566145.html) the reporting will be.

This...is very enlightening.

I knew about the other aspects, but what had confused me was how certain people acted. It has shed a kind of logic onto past events which I had trouble making sense of. Why certain politicians, e.g. Medvedev and Kadyrov especially, seem to go off the deep end and make embarrassments of themselves.

But I was thinking in a faulty way. I thought of their words/actions in terms of propaganda and/or some kind of face-saving bluster or even as a way of getting in good with Putin.

It didn't occur to me that their words/actions could be interpreted as a political tool that *undermines* Putin, but it makes sense. These people probably aren't stupid and realized Putin/Russia miscalculated greatly. It makes sense that they'd begin preparing for a scenario where Russia might lose and chaos ensues.

Kadyrov's actions makes much more sense in this regard. I'm still unsure how Medvedev's and Lavrov's statements fit into the grand scheme, but at least I can see it from this different perspective.",2022-07-25,w7etx2,ihjq1ld

I mean...""independant"", and putting all their army on a permanent defense, so they can claim that any Ukrainian counter-offensive is a vile act of aggression. This would be sold off as a massive achievment and make the war seem worth it because Putin can actually still come out on top and maintain has narrative of Russia being a hero.

The worst case scenario on the other hand, would be far more grim: if Ukraine manages to push back the Russians, even as far back as Crimea or the Russian borders, Putin might actually be insane enough to declare the counter-offensive an act of war against Russian home turf and put his nukes to use, because it's obvious he won't be able to push back the Ukrainians any more and having Russia lose even more land than they had before the war would be a catastrophic result which could end Putin's reign back home, given the last remaining soldiers return and will tell everyone about the failures in Ukraine.

It had a lot of equipment that it discovered was ""lost"" or not usable, when it kicked this off, but it still had a decent amount of Precision munitions, and a fuckton of dumb ammo. It's first problem started in the north near Kyiv once it moved out past 50 miles of it's staging bases and had to truck in shit, but due to misusing what precision munitions it had, and failing hard in the air war, Russia couldn't protect it's convoys which cut off it's forces from their needed supplies. Then Russia retreated, and swung around to the Donbass region where it again started from initial staging bases, and also had rail lines that it kept it's artillery train next to, this allowed them to have ammo piles right next to the artillery and lay down withering fire. But they again moved out away from their staging grounds, and then HIMARS came into play taking out the ammo dumps and the artillery piles, again forcing them to pull back and truck in supplies from deep into Russia. While at the same time Russia had blown through almost all their precision munitons and the sanctions prevented them from getting the parts to make more.

When Germany announced that they want to deliver these weapons it was always clear that this wont happen in a matter of some weeks. End of the year is a more realistic date for a best case scenario.
And that the government will refuse to approve the export is highly unlikely after Scholz himself announced the delivery allready in front of the whole parliament.

Regarding the tanks for Poland. It seems that Poland had completely unrealistic expectations. They wanted hundreds of Leopard 2A7V. A version of which only a few dozen exist. Not even the German army has upgraded most of their (very few) tanks to that version. There is just nothing there to give to anyone in short term. 

Instead Germany offered stocked 2A4 (which are older models but still way better than T-72s), that would be upgraded to 2A7V in the same pace as the tanks of the Bundeswehr. 

That doesn't seem to have been good enough for Polands government and since then they have been acting as if Germany broke a promise and practically insulted them personally by not magically conjuring up hundreds of the latest Leopard 2 models out of thin air and gifting them to Poland.

I know, many on reddit love to read stories about how Germany is deliberately delaying help for Ukraine. But I strongly advise to not just believe such stories without checking the facts and reasons.

Here Scholz likely declared ""national demand"" to circumvent the original deal (citing demand of Germany and gifting the system to Ukraine) which isn't possible with the current concept.

With this Ukraine shall get money from the german government to buy needed stuff from the german weapon manufacturers ‚Äì and it decided to try to buy ten more Iris-T SLM with it because it is likely a convincing system. This should be the application that is on the desk of Scholz ‚Äì which he hasn't signed since three weeks which is the only real information the original article has. The problem here is that Iris-T SLM has to be produced first and there are already other customers waiting for it with no exit clause in sight.

There's something broken about the way our journalism, education, and popular media builds up the ""benevolent outsider"" as a modern mythical archetype.  It's such a common narrative now -- and a completely false narrative -- that we need ""outsiders"" and ""disruptors"" to fix our systems.  

They never ""fix"" systems.  

At best, they come in without the knowledge of the system, so they have no idea what they're doing and end up accomplishing nothing at all.

At worst, they break systems and force them to rebuild themselves -- and this allows the elite and privileged to corrupt the process and the rebuilt system is way better for them to insulate their own interests and better exploit the rest of the masses.

He has damaged the Russian arms industry, whose customers now see even its latest and most advanced products as pretty useless in modern warfare.

He has made Russia into an international pariah, with so few friends they can be counted on a single hand with fingers to spare; even most former Soviet countries are distancing themselves from Moscow.  This isolation will only get worse as the food crisis they have caused inflicts serious suffering around the globe.

I don't think many thought russia was ""out of supplies"" after the move over to the Donbass, close to the rail lines which are the lifeblood of russian war doctrine. And Russia was able to, admittedly slowly, move forward in the East, close to their rail lines and supplies for the last two months. But slowly.

HIMARS apparently are now hitting russian supply depots in the East and South, within the range of HIMARS and guided artillery supplied to Ukraine,  so the reliance on close rail supply is now a ""problem"" for russia like the convoy was ""a problem"" (not as bad, but a huge problem given the artillery-based strategy).You can correct this if I am wrong.

They use nukes offensively: Ukraine, which has so far hoped and counted on Russia not using their nukes, will now realize that Russia is here to annnhiliate the country and is willing to use even nukes to achieve their goals. Ukraine will probably surrender to avoid any further destruction and loss of life. NATO will also probably stop supplying Ukraine because the war escalated from a conventional one to one of nuclear warfare. Russia wins the war.

2. They use nukes on the defensive: Ukraine will stop any further counter-offensives to avoid Russia dropping more nukes and again: to avoid more destruction and loss of life. Russia gets to keep all the newly acquired territory. If they will continue their invasion another time or whatever, remains to be seen. Russia can still sell off the war as a massive success because they liberated the ""independant"" territories from Ukraine and has annexed them. Russia ""wins"" THEIR war.


Let's stop pretending like we live in a ""everything is gonna be alright if we just believe the good guys win"" kind of world.

I'm not sure how you think you just show up at the front lines on your own and get given a gun and off you go to fight but that's not how it works, even in the middle of a war where both sides are no doubt rushing training to some extent. You need to be put under the command of someone, issued equipment, you need training or vetting that you already have it.

Some random person showing up at the front lines in civilian clothes or the camo fatigues they bought off ebay is going to be met with ""Who the fuck are you?"" in Ukrainian and at best be turned around and worst be arrested until they figure out what kind of brain damage you have and what you were up to. Of course you probably won't get within 20 kilometers of the front because you'd end up going through check points and not have the correct documentation or the equipment to look like a soldier. They don't stop the 12 guys riding on top of a BMP decked out with body armor and assault rifles but a one off in a car with no weapon that says in some foreign language ""I'm going to fight?""

Especially since Russia is getting desperate. Increasing the age and taking in Prisons, and now reports of recruits getting days of training before being sent it. Meanwhile Ukraine is getting troops trained in allied countries on allied weapon systems that they are bringing back to Ukraine.

Saddam hadn't spent any money on maintenance in 10+ years, very little was functioning and only the smallest minority disobeyed orders and actually mobilized to fight (which were untrained conscripts). Ukraine is a different situation, Zelensky ordered his army to fight and it did. USA only fought conscript hold outs in Iraq.

And I already said Russia took a lot of territory in the first couple weeks, but Ukraine has since gained back more than they have lost in the east, far more. But people that want to look at the overall situation in the most negative light focus on two medium size cities in the east that the Russians spent the last two months focusing the majority of their forces to take and ignore all the ground Ukraine made up north of Kharkiv, in some cases pushing all the way to the Russian border, and the increasing gains down south. That doesn't even get into Russia abandoning the entire front near Kyiv and retreating all the way through Belarus back to Russia.

Obviously losing Severdonetsk and Lysychansk is not positive for Ukraine. You know where the front line in the east was before February 24? It was few kilometers outside of Severdonetsk. Popasna and Izyum they took nearby are even smaller cities and took months to take as well.

So if you take the front line a couple weeks after the invasion where they stabilized after the initial Russian push Russia has taken 4 cities in the east all with a population of 100,000 or smaller. In a country with 44 million people in it. Meanwhile both their attacks against Ukraine's largest cities have been pushed back and then completely stalled in one case, Kharkiv, and completely abandoned for the other, Kyiv. I find it interesting that most people that say Ukraine is doing poorly want to focus on the east and ignore al the other fronts, ones where Ukraine is doing far better and not only repulsing attacks but then regaining ground.

Obviously it would be even better if Ukraine wasn't losing any ground anywhere or had never lost any in the February 24th invasion but looking at the situation as it is today and the overall trends things look pretty favorable for Ukraine. Their victory is not certain, we'll see if the next few months they can take back more heavily defended Russian territory but the rough outline I gave above is why many analysts are now hopeful Ukraine can make substantial gains and get close to pre February 24th borders.

> Ukraine has a &quot;Significant potential&quot; to advance its forces on the battlefield and needs to increase the intensity of its attacks on Russian forces, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his nightly address on July 21.

> The resolution recognizes that Russia&#039;s actions, including forced deportations to Russia and the killing of Ukrainian civilians in mass atrocities, constituted genocide against the people of Ukraine.

> The resolution calls on the United States, along with NATO and European Union allies, to support the government of Ukraine to prevent further acts of Russian genocide against the Ukrainian people and supports tribunals and international criminal investigations to hold Russian political leaders and military personnel accountable.

In consensus processes you kick an asshole out of the group if they are being an asshole.  

The purpose of making everyone vote yes is that then they are committed.  Suppose you are voting on whether or not cookies will be available at Saturday events. If everyone says they want cookies then it is far more likely that people will do some baking.  They own the decision and follow through.  Any member can veto cookies or abstain.  Abstaining probably means your volunteer is not going to bake anything but does not mind cookies.  A veto might be negotiable like ""my Jimmy has peanut allergy"" so the group has to accommodate.  If one person shows up to planning sessions and always vetoes everything because she wants to ruin Saturday events you just kick her out. At least out of planning committee if not Saturday events too.  

Consensus voting also has a mental effect on those who have to vote.

(and of course everything else is more expensive as well, it will be  absolutely crippling, even if they suck it up & spend that ‚Ç¨50000 on solar panels)

13130,"Well they buy votes and drive people to vote for their party, but even without that they'd get the majority votes for sure, he had supermajority for 12 years now, people just simply don't care enough to even vote for anyone else, also Orb√°n's party owns pretty much every media outlet in the country, so they can lie about anything anytime, and have tv stations literally feed propaganda all day long. For weeks before election this years, if you ever turned to any of the state TV channels, it was just CONSTANT ""FIDESZ (Orb√°n's party) good, opposition bad"", so bad they literally played Orb√°n's speeches for hours and hours without end, and the opposition politicians only got 5 minutes to speak. That's not a joke, in 4 years, the entire opposition only got 5 minutes on national TV, and that was at a very early hour, when noone even watched it, and it never got replayed.  
 For people like me, and well most of the younger generation, who don't just watch tv, but actually read news online and socialize with outside world we didn't even know they are this strong, we kinda lived in our bubbles because we mostly interracted with eachother, and honestly even FIDESZ was scared this year a little bit, but wast majority of the country, and the people who vote live in smaller vilages and are pretty much brainwashed, as much as I hate this word, to only vote for Orb√°n. So much as at voting booths you could hear people being so stupid just going to others asking which one is Orb√°n, which one is the correct answer...  
There was no voting fraud, there was no cheating, other than paying people and driving them there, but as I said, i'm 100% sure Orb√°n would've won just about as much without that.

> NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg reportedly urged a legislative body of the European Union to &quot;Stop complaining&quot; and take action to support Ukraine during the ongoing war with Russia.

> Stoltenberg, who has been NATO&#039;s secretary general since 2014, added: &quot;We should stop complaining and step up and provide support, full stop.""

> While urging the European Parliament to &quot;Stop complaining&quot; and provide the financial aid to Ukraine, Stoltenberg stressed that not helping Ukraine could put Europe in peril down the road. &quot;It is in our interest to help Ukraine because you have to understand that if Ukraine loses this, that&#039;s a danger for us,&quot; the Post quoted him as saying.

13158,"The comments here are utterly amazing. They all ignore the actual reality which is that with the past few years so many people are barely keeping their heads above water and our governments are buying more weapons to send to Ukraine then they are food for their own people. This idea that ""hey if Russia wins life might be tougher"" is dumb because life for so many in Europe is already near impossible. Its absurd to ask those barely surviving to just let themselves drown because, well, in a decade you might perhaps have a chance of drowning again. We don't have the money, the rich do, so go and get it from them instead of continuing to gut our welfare and social services.

To the Americans bitching about the nations in Europe and their NATO contributions, please go away. You do not understand Europe and your warmongering is your own business. I understand that you don't get things like good welfare, free healthcare etc but they are actually great things that we need more investment in. If you want more drones for Ukraine you magic up the money, don't steal it from the poor that need that welfare as we see record inflation.

Also, this idea that America is only in NATO out of the kindness of its heart is insane, the US is part of it in order to exert the global influence it needs to survive. You aren't actually going to leave, and, even if you did, Russia still wouldn't be a major threat. The US needs NATO, no matter how much it bitches about 2% every so often. Europe doesn't get ""a free ride"" because if it did America would never agree to it. The US acts as the worlds police and consistently conduct illegal wars which trade lives for more funds for arms manufacturers, do you really think they give a shit about Europe outside of its support for their position on the world stage? Of course they don't.

Edit: Its funny how people live to bitch about Russian bots but it always seems like anyone critical of the US or anything other than unrestrained military spending gets downvoted to hell. Russia is a shit semi-fascist oligarchy but I refuse to accept that they best way to combat them is too dismantle our entire welfare systems and spend it all on US weapons.",2022-07-20,w31iti,iguvz7x

Russia is literally at their door and they are the ones who's next on the menu if Russia gobbles up Ukraine. The US and Americans seem more resolved to help Ukraine so long as the Zelenskyy and Ukrainian people are willing to fight.

Americans are pissed about inflation, tanking asset prices, and higher energy costs, but most also realize that the pain is here and will likely continue. While the right likes to blame Biden, I think the average American also feels that America needs to do what it takes to contain Russia even if it means economic pain because if we don't it's going to worse in the future when we pay both the economic price and blood price for containing Russia/China. 

I'm not surprised USA/Americans are more willing to pay the financial price (as opposed to the blood price paid in Afghanistan) to preserve US lead world order. And OFC these statements don't apply to all Europeans, Poland and many of the ex-USSR countries were the first to respond with weapons, tanks, supplies, and refugee support before the US could even get over there. 

But other parts of Europe?  I'm just surprised how they can act like this isn't happening RIGHT outside their doorstep. As if USA and NATO will GUARANTEE Russia doesn't attack them. Putin has proven he doesn't give a shit. USA likely won't use nukes even if Russia invades a NATO member. If China and Russia moved in unison? USA might not be there to bail Europeans out immediately since it will be splitting forces to protect multiple fronts.

13381,">So lets say Europe doesn't help Ukraine. How would that help gas prices?

It would stop them from increasing at a faster rate.  Russia supplies a lot of oil and gas to the EU.  If they cut that off, they need to find an alternative source.  Any alternative source is invariably going to be more expensive, and due to global shortages, it's going to push prices up even further.

>The faster the war is over, the quicker gas prices will normalize. At this point that means you either want Russia to win or Ukraine to win.

While theoretically true, there's nothing that suggests that the EU completely cutting off Russia would end the war any quicker than doing nothing at all.  At best, it will force Putin to nationalize the economy into a war-time economy, which *might* trigger some form of rebellion, but probably won't do shit (after all, they already had their elections subverted and those protests went nowhere, why would returning to USSR economic standards have any greater impact?).  So long as Asian, African, and South American countries are still willing to trade with Russia, Russia can survive the sanctions from the West pretty much indefinitely, albeit at a reduced standard of living.  Anyone thinking that the EU still buying oil and gas from Russia is the last thread holding Russia together and that cutting that off would force a collapse of Russia is delusional.  If anything, the economic hardship brought on by that would simply make joining the army a better proposition for Russians, which just makes the problem worse.

So the argument is basically ""pay a lot more for oil and gas, experience shortages and economic contraction, and maaaaaybe the war will end a few months earlier than it would otherwise, but maybe not"".  Most people would rather just avoid that kind of hardship altogether.  After all, there's no world in which Russia tries to go toe-to-toe with NATO that doesn't involve nuclear weapons, and if it gets to that point, things like ""how much is my heating bill going to be this winter"" or ""how long will this war drag on"" become somewhat meaningless.

The Americans and consequently, Nato, don't. The longer it goes, the weaker both Russia and Europe gets, it's the old American adage, ""let them fight it out, and after a while , we swoop in as the saviors of the slightly more well off side"".

13606,">Wow the poorest answer imaginable, the same amount as a random other country.

Random country - I picked it because it's the second largest economy in the EU, 2nd largest budget contributor in the EU, in the top 10 of global defence spenders, member of the G7 and a holder of one of the few permanent seats on the UN Security Council - but yeah, just random.

>Yeah who isnt..

Most countries are training Ukrainians on specific equipment they are supplying - the UK is training them in terms of training them to act as general infantry, something many countries aren't doing.

It's a continuation of a policy where the UK trained 22,000 Ukrainian soldiers in since 2014, the only other countries doing similar being the United States, Canada, Poland, Sweden, Lithuania and Denmark - the proactive nature of which is likely why Ukraine is able to deploy a depth of units all trained to NATO standards.

>Look it up every country which gave away soviet Tanks for exchange gets german ones..

I looked it up - the only country receiving German tanks in exchange for sending Soviet-era tanks is Greece, so exactly one country and no information on numbers has been announced as the word tanks was loosely mentioned alongside other equipment.

>The thing is populist government of poland is good in presenting themselves the fact is they took the old American Tanks and also demands the newest Version of the leopard for exchange (which they knew is impossible to just deliver, not even the bundeswehr has a full range of them)

Germany could have easily provided a better alternative, like the newer tanks when available and in the meantime Germany would deploy tanks to Poland to ensure that Poland didn't lose it's deterrent, it chose not to and as such Poland went with American tanks who offered exactly that - along with that they also get British tanks deployed in Poland to support Polish tanks whilst the American tanks are being readied and delivered.

>Its just shitting on germany because its good for their politics. The government is one of the biggest Problems europe has

Poland has a pretty shitty Government, but it's not like it's not expected or particularly unique in Europe or the EU - in fact, I'd argue that despite being a problem in both those senses, they aren't close to being the worst problem Europe has.

That's mainly because whilst having some poor domestic policies they are also one of the largest supporters of a stronger defence against Russia and one of the biggest supporters of importing energy from alternative sources whilst other Western European countries have been completely obtuse to this - you can blame Poland for some stuff in Europe, but the biggest challenge in the past half a century in Europe has nothing to do with them at all, in fact they've been actively ignored on their stance despite them being in the right.",2022-07-19,w31iti,iguj4y7

What has likely happened is the companies are running far leaner than they're supposed to.  Maybe spares were never ordered and the money pocketed.  Maybe a part was swapped for a cheaper one.

Ukraine will fight to the last man or woman, and they'd do it with tooth and claw if they ran out of bullets. They won't run out of equipment any time soon, because the international community will gladly give Ukraine weapons indefinitely.

We didn't underestimate Russia, we (in many cases) overestimated them. We expected them to roll through Ukraine as they *should* have been able to.

You talk about the past yet you ignore what's literally just happened.

Thankfully, Russia was incompetent and sustained vast losses and achieved very little.

The war in Ukraine is a gift to America. Russia has regressed itself by over a decade. Why would America and its allies stop throwing resources at Ukraine?

America gets to buy its own very expensive weapons, which feeds into its own military industrial complex. That's good for politicians.

And those weapons are used, with virtually no risk to American military personal, against one of its primary antagonists. It's basically free attacks on America's biggest historical enemy (ignoring China, a topic for another time.)

Same with the UK. Russia literally botched assassination attempt using chemical weapons in the south of England that ended up killing someone (not the target(s)). 

We will happily keep handing over expensive weapons, providing humanitarian aid, and training, because a stronger Ukraine means a weaker Russia. And the public sentiment in Britain is very much ""Fuck Russia. Slava Ukraini.""

The reason the full-scale invasion happened was because the US and UK did nothing in 2014. It emboldened Russia, who then overestimated its own competence and underestimated Ukraine.

The current British ruling political party [loved Russian money](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-61080537). Our PM Boris Johnson carried out [bullshittery bordering treason](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-62068421). But those ties have become toxic, so political will swings violently the other way.

We won't let Russia punch us for free again.

Russia's and Ukraine's neighbours have also seen the price of inaction and appeasement. 

Every Russian invader killed in Ukraine is one that won't be marching through Warsaw or Riga. 

Every Euro and bullet and meal donated to Ukraine is one that's spent fighting Russia. And Ukraine are the only ones paying in blood. For the international community that suddenly finds fighting Russia to be extremely urgent, that's a fucking bargain.

And in fairness to Germany, they rapidly brought the hammer down on the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea gas pipeline. They've shown they'll take pain themselves in order to hurt Russia.

Ukraine will keep fighting, and are going to continue to receive the best weapons and training we can give.",2022-07-20,w31iti,igwjzl5

You say the West would keep supplying with resources, sure, not with boots on the ground though. For better or worse Ukrainian casualties are more irreplaceable than Russian casualties.

Only reason the war lasts longer *is* because the West is supplying the Ukrainians, however they cannot and do not supply them with men. A war of attrition lasts for years, not (for) a few months. Once the Ukrainian numbers start going down who is going to replace them? Especially the veterans?

Are you and your compatriots goings to fight there?

A Russian, any Russian in Warsaw and Riga is also total world annihilation, It can't be. No matter how many of them are they they can't set foot in NATO soil in the nuclear age.

I can't see Russians losing a war of attrition because it's almost never the case for the small guy to win over the larger guy, not for long.

The war will possibly end with Ukraine paying war damages to Russia (measured land and physical wealth as well as a Finland like relationship) ... *unless* you see (western) boots on the ground.

Uktrimately war is not won purely by weapons (even MAD is not a win, it's annihilation for both sides) but by men and women on the field.

Sanctions almost never work if you do not have the rest of the world follow (and they did not), not being in need of their resources is what works. 2014 should have signaled a total and complete change of pace *against* the use of Russian energy.

A little over 10 years ago, a large amount of natural gas and petroleum was discovered in eastern Ukraine, in the Donbass region.  A little under 10 years ago, Ukraine's president made a unilateral decision out of nowhere to align the country with Russia, rather than the EU as had been planned.  Shortly after this, a series of widespread protests removed him from office.  Shortly after that, Russia invaded Crimea and began funding separatists in eastern Ukraine.  Ukraine then started trying to get into NATO.  Ukraine was making steady progress towards that goal, and there were some who believed they might have been given an MAP (membership action plan) this summer at the NATO summit.  Then suddenly Russia decides to recognize Donetsk and Luhansk as independent republics, and then proceeds to invade to ""secure"" them.

It all comes down to the fact that 45% of Russia's economy comes from oil and gas.  If Ukraine were to develop their oil and gas fields and start exporting that to the EU, the EU wouldn't need Russian oil and gas (which largely already transits through Ukraine, so it wouldn't require a huge expensive pipeline project to get to EU nations), which would cause the Russian economy to severely contract if not outright collapse.

Regarding espionage, there is a time cost for developing domestic assets. By constraining the flow of foreign assets, you reduce the overall capacity for action. For example one element of counter-espionage is the flushing of suspected assets out of a specific sector/agency/whatever, which forces your enemy to reacquire assets before they can regain the same capacity to act within that niche again. The looser your restrictions over the flow of people, the more such capacity your enemy can hold in reserve, and the more they can parallelize the effort to redevelop domestic assets.

The biggest issue is that Russia has terrible strategic, tactical and logistic coordination. Russia hasn't really established air superiority which has given Ukraine significantly more room to maneuver and counter Russian attacks. Ukraine should not be able to establish artillery positions, those should be easy targets for the Russian air force. But, lucky Russian incompetence has allowed Ukraine to set up positions and shell Russian forces. 

And it seems that Russian vehicles often don't have sufficient infantry support. Which allows anti-tank armed Ukrainians to take out Russian armor.

There are two possibilities: Russia is bluffing or Russia is serious.

From that, we have four cases:

1. Russia is bluffing and we call their bluff. We win by not giving into their demands and utterly crushing them.
2. Russia is bluffing and we believe them. They win and will undoubtedly keep pushing the envelope.
3. Russia isn't bluffing but we think they are. They nuke us, leading to a nuclear exchange that launches the world into a nuclear autumn or nuclear winter.
4. Russia isn't bluffing and we believe them. They win and will undoubtedly keep pushing the envelope.

Obviously the only case there at all acceptable to US leadership is #1. Sure, cases #2 and #4 seem preferable to case #3, but also would embolden Russia and probably ultimately lead to case #3 or somehow a non-nuclear WW3 anyways.

14298,"Russia does have a pretty sophisticated nuclear industry and had a nuclear warhead modernization during the last couple of years, as this [congressional report](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/nuke/R45861.pdf) elaborates. 
Nuclear maintenance is done by profitable state corporation Rosatom. They got a number of excellent scientists still publishing on arxiv frequently. They also construct and maintain nuclear power plants - also outside Russia - with no major security incidence since Russia was established as a nation. Due to the economic setup, the maintenance of their nuclear warheads somewhat ""pays for themselves"" and is not part of the normal military budget.
For the hydrogen bombs Tritium Deuterium gas has be be exchanged regularly since it decays with a half life of around 5 years. [See this discussion on the nuclear weapons subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nuclearweapons/comments/uelpcn/yield_of_poorly_maintained_hydrogen_bomb_questions/)
The congressional report also contains a section where US intelligence has some reason to believe Russia isn't fully adhering to the 0 yield test policy when conducting hydrodynamic tests (Tests of warheads with no nuclear or subcritical nuclear components)

Based on this information, I conclude that the warheads are the least likely component to fail. The logistics of a full nuclear first strike is [fairly complex though](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fratricide) and it stand to question how well it can be executed by russian strategic forces in practice. Strictly spoken, the US and other nuclear armed nation have the same problem since there are no historic precedences for nuclear war and you only know how well it was all planned out after the fact.",2022-05-05,uj56oq,i7gu38e
14299,"> all those nukes require maintenance, and it's pretty clear the Russian military doesn't have that kind of money

Not only this, the vast majority of Russia's old soviet nukes never made it onto actual rockets of any sort. They're just warheads stored in bunkers. 

That is the main reason no one is truly worried. The weapons that Russia has on hand ready to fire at a moments notice in their subs is nothing to scoff at and is absolutely a big bargaining chip for them. But, they're not large and there's not thousands of them on hand. If they chose to launch what they have, it would do a lot damage but, not ""end of the world"" damage. If they pushed launch on those, the world would respond with 1000x the force within minutes. 

The only way for Russia to truly win a large scale nuclear war is for them to start getting those old warheads out and on vehicles. And, that would absolutely be noticed. Those storage sites are well known and watched heavily by satellites. The only thing that would actually scare the rest of the world would be if Russia actually started doing this. Because it would be a major red flag that Russia is actually preparing to attack. So far, the most of I have seen is Russia showing off a SLBM loaded sub and testing an ICBM.

You can go on bomb maps and play around with how far blast and  radiation domes spread based off different payloads and while ridiculously staggering they can't come close to eclipsing all life whatsoever.

Nukes wouldn't be launched 1 per grid square over all of populated territory everywhere either. They'd be launched in clusters at tactical epicentres and high population areas to defeat counter measures. A number of nukes would be intercepted and destroyed over the ocean and arctic as well. Water is an absolutely incredible radiation sink, just to put in context the water used in reactors for cooling fuel rods is safe to swim at surface level.

It's impossible to gauge the effectiveness of the deployment of anti-ICBM counter measures en masse as a layperson because they've obviously never been tested like that, the information surrounding their use is protected and their locations are hidden but it would be reasonable to assume at least somewhat marginal effectiveness. So yes, 16,000 nukes towards western territory would be an unrivalled fucking utter massacre of human life but it wouldn't kill **everything everywhere**.

I'm legitimately curious how the narrative on comedy shifted in the last decade. I seem to default to thinking ""poorly aged jokes"" were comments on ridiculous stereotypes, rather than attacks on specific groups. Like, most times I heard a ""homophobic"" joke, I usually thought the joke is aimed at socially constructed stereotypes and the idiots who blindly believe them, rather than homosexuals themselves. I gave writers the benefit of the doubt. I still do.

Now, Trey and Matt may have turned out to be fucking idiots who were *actually* poking fun at Gore's fight against global warming. I kinda love that context, because now I can go into the episode and laugh at them.

It's worth noting that our idea of ""actual action"" is skewed as fuck.

Osama believed that America was too ""war weary"" to hit him back.  America is tired *from* war, not tired *of* war, in the way that an Olympic runner is more frequently tired *from* running than the average fat man because THEY FUCKING LOVE TO RUN.

My favorite anecdote surrounding this is the US response to Syria.  The President of the ruling party announced his intention to send troops into a conflict and requested a Use of Force authorization from Congress.  The opposition party complained about this request because.....**it wasn't use of forcey enough** for them.

> Even before setting out on his four-country tour, Foreign Minister Sergey V.

> July 24, 2022, 10:16 a.m. ET.For months, the United States, Britain and the European Union have tried to turn the argument in their favor by laying the responsibility for the soaring price of bread and other basic foods squarely at Mr. Putin&#039;s feet, roundly condemning Russia for shutting down the flow of Ukrainian grain to the world through the Black Sea.On Friday, Russia agreed to a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey that would allow Ukraine to export its grain.

> Nearly 30 percent of Egypt&#039;s tourists came from Russia before the war, and Russia is building a $26 billion nuclear power plant in Egypt.

> Pro-Russian separatist forces have stepped up the forced conscription of men - including Ukrainian passport holders - in occupied areas of the Donbas region, amid mounting evidence of the scale of losses on the Russian side.

> According to credible evidence from the region, forced conscription - already a feature of the Russian-backed separatists&#039; rule before the Kremlin&#039;s 24 February invasion - appeared to have picked up again in June, with checkpoints and patrols, some reportedly involving Chechen fighters allied to the Kremlin, on the lookout for men to recruit.

> Describing the circumstances of the video, Matviichuk says it appears to have been taken after a period in June when the conscription squads had been relatively inactive at the beginning of a new wave of forced conscriptions.

Not really.  It would be bad, but the consequences would be local.   If the reactors melted down at all (which would only be possible if someone literally tried to do that) it's not likely the fuel would escape the reactor vessel, which doesn't have any penetrations in its lower half... no valves, pipes, or anything, just a big deep bowl.

The VVER reactors have a negative void coefficient, so if coolant stops flowing due to missile impact or deliberate shut down, the reaction slows and generates less heat and power.  Chernobyl was the opposite.

They're relatively safe reactors, about the only thing that could release radiation is a direct hit on the containment vessel by a runway penetration bomb or a nuke.",2022-07-22,w4o1v9,ih4w03e

And the other guy bringing up false moral equivalence - it's not about equivalence or better or worse. This isn't a game where the goal is to do slightly fewer war crimes than the other side so at the end you can say you were the ""good guys."" If you are an ethical person, the goal is to never do any war crimes period. Maybe sometimes it is an unattainable goal because of accidents and misfires and bad apples in the rank and file, but when we are talking about a decision to _intentionally_ commit war crimes on a massive scale, that all goes out the window.

15430,">Not with this reactor design. It's got a negative void coefficient.... that means if the water stops flowing and it starts to heat up, eventually the water boils... in this type of reactor, those bubbles actually slow down the reaction.

I'm aware how a PWR operates, I'm saying that only stops the nuclear reaction, the rods that contain nuclear fuel doesn't loose heat just because you stop the reaction. You have to deal with this by constantly dumping water and removing steam. If these pumps (that are operated on regular power) can't be operational because of power failure you can't cool the rods. Eventually the water evaporated leaving the rods in air when they start melting. Now almost all water is vapor and the reactor vessel is in danger of a hydrogen explosion. The heat is so strong is separates the hydrogen and oxygen molecules. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and this is what happened on the roofs of Fukushima reactors. That's also a pressurized water reactor like the VVER in Zaporizhia. 

>In neither case would the reactor melt down or explode.

I think you don't understand how nuclear reactors generate heat, and that heat stays after you stop the nuclear reaction. Just like a car engine is still hot after you turned the car off. It's the same thing basically. This heat doesn't just go away. You need to pump water on it, especially after a emergency shutdown.

The aggressor always has a choice to simply walk away and not kill anyone. The defender's closest equivalent would be surrendering without fight.

15434,">the rods that contain nuclear fuel doesn't loose heat just because you stop the reaction. 

True, but they aren't going to explode.   You have to get enough heat generated to burst the cladding, and even then some of the generated hydrogen is absorbed by Zinc materials in the assembly.   If the fuel gets hot enough to slump, most likely it will simply travel down the fuel assembly and solidify.

Chances of any generated hydrogen/oxygen forming enough of a gas charge to burst the containment vessel are very low, especially because we're already theorizing there's too little water in the vessel anyway and the core is exposed.

Worst case, corium will pool in the bottom of the reactor vessel and form a molten puddle.  

Oh, and if the reactor actually does an emergency shutdown, then none of this actually happens.  The emergency core cooling system includes boron in the water it pumps in, which acts as a neutron poison and kills any remaining reaction.   There's still heat, but the emergency cooling system is designed to keep up and keep the fuel cool enough so it doesn't become damaged by heat and can be restarted later.

If you want to read more about the failure modes of the VVER-1000 reactors as are installed as Zaporizhizhia, check out this document:

https://www.oecd-nea.org/upload/docs/application/pdf/2020-01/csni-r98-20.pdf

A simple summary is that while the reactors can melt down, they're designed to contain the melt down and not release or spread radiation.    They're nothing like Chernobyl, and if they had a sudden catastrophic event like Fukushima they'd have roughly the same result... molten core material staying inside the reactor vessels, no explosions and relatively little local radiation release.

The sort of event you're thinking about where the reactor explodes and contaminates the countryside only happens with a runaway reaction, and this reactor type is designed to never allow that.",2022-07-22,w4o1v9,ih8eokp

> The State Department included the lists in its annual human trafficking report, which for the first time featured under a 2019 congressional mandate a &quot;State-Sponsored Trafficking in Persons&quot; section.

> Russia appeared frequently throughout the report because of its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine and what the document called the vulnerability to trafficking of millions of Ukrainian refugees in countries to which they have fled.

Ah ah ah. ... pattern recognition and logic, my friend. 

In the life of a concentration camp, one doesn't find out what went on inside until after it's run its course as an institution.

Until then, nobody in the camp can share the (literally) gatekept information, especially if the people are being trafficked around   tortured or systrmatically thrown in a pit.. like people have been  known to do in labor camps.. during a war.

Ukranians got there by trafficking. Look at the war crimes. Separating millions of children and trafficking them.... I mean, the horse is very out of the barn that Russians in power give ~no~ fucks; Ukranians are at animal extermination status, so I'm completely baffled as to where people are getting this trust that a labor camp is not going to be a playground from a Sade novel.

It's just in a cover up latency phase as a concentration is in its infancy.

""‚ÄúWhat I want to speak about is perhaps the classic example of Soviet genocide, its longest and broadest experiment in Russification ‚Äî the destruction of the Ukrainian nation.

The third prong of the Soviet plan was aimed at the farmers, the large mass of independent peasants who are the repository of the tradition, folklore and music, the national language and literature, the national spirit, of Ukraine. The weapon used against this body is perhaps the most terrible of all ‚Äî starvation. Between 1932 and 1933, 5,000,000 Ukrainians starved to death.

**The crop that year was ample to feed the people and livestock of Ukraine**, though it had fallen off somewhat from the previous year, a decrease probably due in large measure to the struggle over collectivization. But a famine was necessary for the Soviet and so they got one to order, by plan, through an unusually high grain allotment to the state as taxes.‚Äù

It's because many opposed the collectivization you describe; they were arrested, jailed, killed, starved. There wasn't a widespread famine, and no, the Ukrainians didn't do it to themselves. Good chunk of what you've shared is outdated and linked to Russian distortions of the history. The grain was taken. Why don't you try Applebaum's Red Famine?

15754,"I think the crux is some people want to use the term genocide because it is more evocative, and others don't think it qualifies so they don't want to sound over-uhh zealous? over-something, there's a good adjective there somewhere.

Most people for the former tend to be a bit too emotionally invested, which causes people to not take them serious.

Whereas the latter are often way too armchair about it; their analysis is skewed by never having even experienced a death, much less war

That said I think it's fair to call it a genocide. It's more accurate than 'war crimes' which is a really sterile way to describe the disgusting shit that happens. Calling it that doesn't ""take away"" from ""real"" genocide victims like jews or tutsis etc, where the common consensus is that those were genocides. Genocide isn't about comparing magnitudes... it's more about intents. That said there needs to be a sufficient magnitude, and I think that there is more than enough.",2022-07-18,w1xs8x,ign5zgx

- was it wrong if Ukraine to legitimize Azov? Yes and no. Yes, because neo-Nazis. No, because Azov and other militia groups essentially saved Ukraine during the first Russian invasion, when Ukraine had no army to speak of. This also served to de-radicalize the battalion and its moments over time.

- are there ‚ÄúnO nAzIs iN uKrAiNe??!!!1‚Äù Of course there are Nazis in Ukraine, just like there are in every country in the world

- is Ukraine ruled by Nazis? Absolutely not. There are a ton of western countries who have fringe ultra-nationalist movements, both in forms of militia and government parties. Ukraine actually had less ultra-nationalist representation in the parliament than many other European nations.

- did Russia attack Ukraine to de-nazify? Absolutely not - see the point above. The ultra-nationalist/neo-Nazi is a fringe movement and represents a tiny sliver of Ukrainian population. I would wager that the USA has more neo-Nazis per capita than Ukraine, and we have a concerning growth of armed fat-right militias that were already classified as extremist organizations by other countries. This doesn‚Äôt mean the rule the USA (at least not yet), and this doesn‚Äôt mean that American citizens who oppose them would welcome a military invasion to ‚Äúde-nazify‚Äù the country
- are Ukrainians as a whole more radicalized against Russians now, after the beginning of this last invasion? Of course! Just like the soviets were radicalized against the Germans during and after WW2. So this has become a self-fulfilling prophesy.

Edited to address your last point about bias. Yes, the prevailing western narrative, especially in social media / Reddit is definitely very biased in favor of Ukrainian narrative at the moment, and especially so in the first couple of months of the recent invasion. This is the problem with the concept of moral clarity. Ukraine is objectively on the right side of things, but it doesn‚Äôt mean that everything Ukraine says should be taken as the 100% truth.",2022-07-07,vtnb5i,if8hw6v

Further, in the Donbas, Ukrainian mineral surveys have found a huge Lithium deposit. Prior to the invasion, plans were being drawn up and contracts prepared for western mining companies such as Glencore to begin construction on what would become Europe's first lithium mine, bringing huge wealth to the country and region, just on Russia's border and in direct competition with China, a key Russian ally.

Russia would have been double-insulted by this. One, having a huge prosperous mining town just on their border would surely attract migrants away from Russia, and two, Russia would almost certainly have to pay Ukraine to import its Lithium to build EVs in the not too distant future.

15974,"I wanted to try to collect all the ""reasonable"" (not necessarily reliable) sources of maps that one knows. Sources that get updated regularly and aren't hard to find.

Considering that in all maps for sake of simplicity the territory is marked as occupied, but it is obvious that not every square kilometer of territory is always occupied, it is an approximate idea. Otherwise maps of older conflict would appear way more confusing than they are, trying to identify which territory was under which control at which time. Imagine just the operation Barbarossa in 1941 , hundreds of thousand square kilometers under loose control of Nazi Germany. Thus instead of demanding 100% precision (unrealistic), one can take the map with a grain of salt. For the same reason maps that include only roads seems extremely conservative.

What I know so far:

* **Wiki**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine.svg used here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine
* review: it seems pretty moderate, at times it gets big changes that then get reverted and a sort of compromise between the news is found.
* **Wiki no2**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cities_and_towns_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War
* review: it is a list of notable cities in every region of the Ukraine. This is somewhat indicative like a map because at the end of the day population centers get controlled or contested. Through the location of those one gets an idea of the location of the military forces.
* **Related to Wiki no2** there is this template that is up to date as the list mentioned before, although the page says ""last update in February"": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Russo-Ukrainian_War_detailed_map
* review: it is like the list, somewhat helpful. It somewhat agrees with the first wiki map.
* **scribble finnish powered map**: https://www.scribblemaps.com/maps/view/The-War-in-Ukraine/091194
* review: a map done by finnish volunteers that try to put on the map the various news (like wiki at the end). It seems to agree with the wiki maps, only if focus less on the territory loosely controlled, rather on the estimated frontlines and movements. It feels more as a military map.
* **the UK MoD on twitter**: https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ
* review: less ""live"" updates, most likely a good report.
* **liveuamap**: https://liveuamap.com/
* review: many updates, that give an idea where the battles are happening, but the marking on the map seems somewhat outdated/very conservative at times.
* **Institute for the Study of War assessments**: http://www.iswresearch.org/ and https://twitter.com/TheStudyofWar
* review: they seem in line with other western made maps and the assessment is full of info, although sometimes repeated (due to the nature of the conflict). The ISW maps are sourced by BBC, Guardian and maybe others.
* **Military advisor maps**: https://twitter.com/miladvisor
* review: not really sure, consider all the other sources as well maybe.
* **Al Jazeera tracker with maps** https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/28/russia-ukraine-crisis-in-maps-and-charts-live-news-interactive

I'm a Finn and I was a bit surprised to hear it, so it made me suspicious as there was nothing about anything like that on local news. I knew there was a [big military exercise called Arrow 22](https://maavoimat.fi/en/-/army-mechanised-exercise-arrow-22-to-be-arranged-at-niinisalo) going on. It's a yearly mechanized exercise, and it's very common to have NATO troops take part since we've been in the PfP program for ages now (way longer than many redditors have been alive.) I've been in infantry / combined arms exercises with NATO troops and I did my conscription 20 years ago (plus reservist training after that of course). The exercise is happening at the [S√§kyl√§](https://goo.gl/maps/SsSXwsVz9uPY9hPU8) and [Niinisalo](https://goo.gl/maps/tLqjTChQaRd9BSm17) training grounds, which as you can see are on the western side of Finland and _not_ in the east as was claimed. I'm not sure we even have training grounds for mechanized units in the east, and we're a civilized nation so we're not just going to dump a bunch of tanks in the woods in a civilian area.

Turns out that the rumor that the NATO tanks were being sent to the eastern border came from a Russian troll factory. There's definitely eg. Challenger 2's here but they're on the opposite side of the country. I've got a source for this but it's in [Finnish only, sorry](https://www.is.fi/ulkomaat/art-2000008792920.html). Google Translate may help but it's often hilariously wrong with Finnish so don't  make any hasty conclusions.

There is not much in the way of munitions that is easier than making dumb HE artillery shells. People have been making, and improving them for 150 years.

* Make a mold.
* Cast the body.
* Machine the nose and back end.
* Fill with explosive
* Screw on the back cap
* Provide fuses to be installed at the last minute.
* Propellant charges are in a separate can, and is just a can with primer and propellant charge.

There are a few other details, like the rifling bands, but the main thing is to make the shells the same weight and the same outer shape, so the same artillery aiming tables can be used.

One smart artillery shell probably does the job of 50 or 100 dumb artillery shells, when attacking a single object, like an armored car. But there are times when firing 100 or 1000 shells are what you want to do.

16069,"Hello Ukraine!

Firstly, I want to share a message here.
I'm not writing this for fun but because I want truly share a message to you.
I don't care if somebody even cares about my post or not, the only thing I care is that I've shared a message and the positive effects for the readers. I want to write out and share my thoughts.

I want to say that I've great respect for you guys, you try to help others and defend your nation and move on even with the destruction the war brings. I must say I've really underestimate you. I thought you were just a poor, weak, corrupt post-Soviet nation with a terrible infrastructure and terrible life circumstances just like another poor country. But no, I was wrong. I'm amazed by your motivation, willpower, togetherness and the fact you make you all stand against the agression. I thought also that the Ukrainians army was weak with outdated weapons and the Russian army was huge, strong, motivated and with modern weapons and equipment and because of that Ukraine will fall in 1 week.
But I was wrong, it's good that it happened this way because the rest of the world wouldn't accept and the conflict would escalate more because Russia and the NATO countries would be next to each other or there would be a Yanukovych 
Ukraine 2.0.

I want also say that you mustn't lose your hope, faith and motivation, things aren't going well as you expected but please have faith that everything will be alright and will go as it planned. I believe this too.
I want also say that you're not alone! We're there for you, for you to help with everything!

I want also say that I've also great respect for your president, Zelensky. I'm not a fanboy or something but just have respect for him. I can imagine like what he is going through like now. I've heard he was a comedian playing the role of president but now he's actually president. He has also children I've read and his nation is invaded so I can understand his feelings and stress because for example the weapons and other equipment delivery doesn't go as expected. 
My opinion is that we as the rest of the world (I'm from The Netherlands) should help them with different kinds of things, including weapon delivery. 
The world should help Ukraine rebuild after the war but my opinion is also that the EU and other organizations must help Ukraine with their infrastructure. For example the road network could be improved and there could be made a start with the highway network. 
This will benefit Ukraine and people from other countries and this will also contribute to the recovery from Ukraine of the war.

Lastly I want to repeat that the Ukrainian nation can't be divided by anyone, any organisation, regime, group or country.
Luhansk, Donetsk and Crimea are an undisputed part of Ukraine and associated with Ukraine a long time.
I also support you to the path to the EU, I believe in Ukraine joining the EU, Eurozone and Schengen because Ukraine belongs to the European and EU family. It has also rightfully earned this position imo because of their fight for freedom, democracy, culture and their nation. Crimea was only Russian for 200 years I read, and the so called countries ""Luhansk"" and ""Donetsk"" are in my opinion runned by some Russophile scum. These ""nations"" have no right to exist because the areas were always Ukrainian.
To conclude, I've a message to those Russophile scum:
DON'T TOUCH YOUR FUCKING HANDS ON UKRAINAN TERRITORY AND FUCK OFF!!!
If you love Russia and loyal to them, fine but go to Russia.
Don't try making your own nations or ask Russia to be annexed by them because this is a very bad idea, just move to Russia instead and live there.

Thank you for reading my long text,
I know this is a long text but I want to share all of this.
I hope that this might be a band aid on a very big wound.

Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk are Ukraine!!

And that got me thinking about how large of a warship could make the transit along the Rhine-Main-Danube route to the Black Sea, and what the practical limitations to such a delivery method would be.

u/chaos0xomega is one smart cookie and they brought up possible height limitations. The whole (albeit short) thread is here

[https://www.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vmw8hx/comment/ie64hs8/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vmw8hx/comment/ie64hs8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Well, I was doing some checking and the smallest Frigates, Corvettes, or Destroyer Escorts have a draft of a little over 4 meters; with some being even shallower than that into the 3 meter range.

Lifted directly from Wikipedia,

>The channel is a Waterway Class Vb; the largest authorised vessel is 190 metres (620 ft) long and 11.45 metres (37.6 ft) wide. The channel in the Kelheim-bound Bamberg lock has a depth of 2.70 metres (8.9 ft).

I'm not sure if that's the shallowest one along the route, but I'm going on the assumption that that's a good starting figure. Like the Brandenburg class listed below, I expect some of the stated drafts could be due to Sonar apertures and/or screws and not the actual hull's depth.

You could lighten the load on these vessels by removing stores, ammunition, and some easily dismountable equipment like guns, radar, etc. The sonar gear and screws are also removable if you need to make the vessel shallower.

It might even make getting permission to transit from the countries en route much more palatable if the warship(s) in question were under tow and disarmed. If there's a friendly drydock or floating drydock in the Black Sea, you simply reinstall everything when it arrives.

If it's a previously retired or older ship, this could simply be part of its modernization. Strip out whatever was going to be replaced, tow it through, and then start the work of installing the new stuff.

The height issue is one I hadn't been aware of though. It's possible to remove the masts and such; possibly raze some of the superstructure as well. This would also serve to lower the draft even further.

What are the height limitations along the route? I saw some images of river cruise vessels and freighters that were fairly tall, but I have no idea if they travelled the entire route.

Here are some of the active and/or reserve ships that could be considered.

Anzac Class: Draught 4.35 m (14.3 ft) at full load)

La Fayette-class frigate: Draught 4.1 m (13 ft 5 in).

Flor√©al-class frigate: Draught 4.3 m (14 ft 1 in)

Brandenburg-class frigate: Draught 4.35 metres (14.3 ft) (6.3 metres (21 ft) over sonar)

Elli-class frigate: Draft 4.4 m (14 ft 5 in)

Alpino-class frigate: Draught 3.8 m (12 ft 6 in)

Lupo-class frigate: Draft 3.7 m (12 ft)

Maestrale-class frigate: Draught 4.2 m (14 ft)

Y≈´bari-class destroyer escort: Draft 3.6 m (11 ft 10 in)

Abukuma-class destroyer escort: Draft 12 ft (3.7 m)

Jacob van Heemskerck-class frigate: Draught 4.4 m (14 ft 5 in)

Some of these are older or already retired and it could suit the nation in question to hand them over to Ukraine. Especially if they were planning or already in the process of replacing them.

And this list doesn't include larger vessels, like America's mothballed Oliver Hazard Perry Class, that could possibly transit with the removal of sonar/screws and the removal of topweight.

It could be an expensive process depending on the work involved in making the warship(s) shallower and shorter. But it seems like it might be viable, at least in principle.

Does anyone know what the height restrictions from bridges are? Could they be partially dealt with by lower the water level via dams/locks? Are there any treaties that make this an exercise in futility? It seems like the Iron Gates are no longer the shipping obstacle they once posed, is this correct?

Any professionals or knowledge sponges out there, how much shallower could you realistically make a vessel by losing weight, screws, and sonar gear? I know they'll get shallower, but how much are we talking about?",2022-06-29,u7w8nf,ie6qimd
16115,"Is the STEN design philosophy an example of how the world can address the armament supply issues?  
  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sten  
  
*"" ..design philosophy of the Sten, namely their low cost and ease of manufacture. Though the MP40 was also built largely for this purpose, Otto Skorzeny went on record saying that he preferred the Sten because it required less raw material to produce, and performed better under adverse combat conditions.""*  
  
Generally, STEN guns and the numerous variants focused on simply being able to do the job, often due to desperate times, being produced cheaply and in large numbers without all the bells and whistles.  
  
I've read articles on reddit about how Ukraine is not getting enough artillery to be able to sufficiently concentrate it, so as to prevent Russians from grouping for attacks. It went on to suggest that this also prevented Ukraine from being able to disrupt enemy actions that prevent it grouping for attacks of it's own.  
  
I've also read about how the diverse range of equipment and systems being supplied to Ukraine could become a problem in the future, as they begin to suffer ware issues and require parts to fix and maintain. As they use different parts, part factories in different countries, have different manuals etc it makes supply of parts difficult, or the repair times lengthy. The more advanced nature of the weapons being supplied I guess compound this.  
  
Looking at the STEN design philosophy, and being pretty ignorant of weapon production, I was wondering if it could be applied to Artillery?  
A simpler, less advanced artillery weapon that can be more cheaply and quickly produced, that is easier to maintain and also hopefully quicker and easier to produce. (It might also cut down training times, but if it's less advanced then crews might need to learn how to manually carry out tasks that modern equipment effectively automates.)  
  
The design could be shared between supporting nations, with each nation building what they can from the same blueprints, with no advanced technology at risk of Russia or third party interrogation. It would not be designed to replace the more advanced systems, but to bridge the gap between now and when a sufficient number of more advanced systems have been delivered, and then to supplement them.  
  
An artillery piece is however not a submachine gun, and if the weapons produced are WW2ish level of sophistication it could be that they are, despite Russia's equivalent equipment issues, too basic to effectively do anything more than waste resources in production and transportation, use of valuable ammo etc.  
  
I was hoping to get more informed opinions on this and how it could be achieved, if there was any value in trying to do so. Please be gentle :)",2022-07-07,u7w8nf,if8lsk7

First of all, I condemn the Russian government, Donetsk separatists,  Luhansk separatists and everyone else supporting and defending Russia and it's allies for this inhumane war.
May they pay their prize one day and have a suitable punishment for this.
I cannot still believe that there's a war going on in Europe including Ukraine and I feel sorry to all victims of the war.
I've respect to the Ukrainian Army, because they're fighting for their country, the territorial integrity, culture, values and people.
I've also respect for the Ukrainian people because they're living in uncertainty and in tough times but still they're motivated because they believe this all will end well but also because the hell and pain they need to endure right now because of the war.
I've respect for the Ukrainian government too, because they're leading Ukraine, it's people and army during challenging times.
I'm glad that many people including me and countries are standing with Ukraine and are helping them and I want to let this continue because this is important for Ukraine.
I hope that the victory will be for Ukraine or that there will be peace there and the territorial integrity will be respected, that Ukraine will be restored one day as it was before the war and also that all occupied territories rightfully belonging to Ukraine will be returned to Ukraine.
I also hope that the Ukrainians can live in peace and safety without fear and concerns one day.

As last, I want to say:
- Crimea is Ukraine!
- Donetsk is Ukraine!
- Luhansk is Ukraine!

I respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine and recognize these territories only as part of Ukraine.

Along with investigating Ukraine's history, while blaming the US and NATO for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, this book distinguishes the controversial Azov batallion's Nazi origins from the overarching framework of Ukrainian culture, by way of acknowledging the fact that much of the Azov batallion's original neo-nazi membership is comprised of native Russian-speakers from eastern Ukraine. They are not products of Ukrainian culture in the western parts of Ukraine, where the majority of native Ukrainian speakers reside. The book also explains how in Ukraine, the propagation of both Soviet-era nostalgia and leaders like Joseph Stalin, who was the main perpetrator of the holodomor(murder and starvation of millions of Ukrainians), can give rise to counter-extremism such as Nazism. Because Azov was part and parcel of a largely de-centralized Ukrainian resistence to the pro-Russian seperatists in eastern Ukraine during the 8 year civil war (there were many private militias fighting the seperatists), the Ukrainian government basically annexed the paramilitary group, as well as other private militias, into the Ukrainian army...all for the sake of a more organized resistance to seperatist and Russian forces in the Donbas region. At the same time, the Ukrainian army did not assume their ideology. It was the other way around. The private militas were indoctrinated and consigned into true Ukrainian nationalism. Now, it is true that the Azov were instrumental in helping Ukraine, and are at the same time, highly skilled, tactical and pose a real danger if they continue to uphold their nazi ideology and resist full integration into the Ukrainian army. But I highly doubt Zelensky, nor much of the native Ukrainian-speaking populations of Ukraine would tolerate it.

So **their** idea of the conflict seems to be:

-after the 2014 Maidan uprising, the legitimately-elected President was illegally deposed and replaced. In response, parts of the Donbas decided they were not on board with the replacement -- and seceded. Those parts of the Donbas have never been allowed to vote in any election since.

-The illegitimate Ukrainian gov't then sent in the army, and Russia decided to defend the Russians living there. This has what has led to the conflict -- and to the Ukrainians killing many ethnic Russians as a result.

-Also, the Ukrainian gov't was persecuting ethnic Russians in the Donbas, making it illegal to speak Russian or to learn it, destroying Russian culture, etc.

-Russia tried to make peace with Minsk agreements, but Zelensky wouldn't honor it, even after he said he would while campaigning.

""Il ne faut pas humilier la Russie pour que le jour o√π les combats cesseront, nous puissions b√¢tir un chemin de sortie par les voies diplomatiques."" a couple days ago.

First one translates as ""Peace can't be built on Russia's humiliation"" ; second as ""we must not humiliate Russia so that when the fighting stops, we can build a diplomatic way out""

I don't read anything about Ukraine giving up territory. It's not about Putin either, but about a country that will likely still exist and be a possible source of nuisance in the decades to come. 

To me he is warning that a humiliated country will only look for revenge (hello post-WWI Germany), and I understand it as Russia must realize the price is too high and give up on its own, rather than be ganged upon and coerced.

I understand this must be frustrating for Ukrainians who have been asking for more involvement from the beginning, but I think the narrative has to be democratic Ukraine repelled unjustified agression and not NATO did everything it could to hurt Russia at its border",2022-06-06,u7w8nf,ibehtau

First off, the plant was by no accounts destroyed. A warehouse of finished chemicals burned down. 

Second, even if it had, simply saying ""everything is needed in war"" doesn't magically mean everything will grind to a halt in weeks. 

> ""AFAIK, they are the only maker of a huge range of solvents and reactives of this kind""

First off ""a reactive"" isn't a chemical term. Maybe he means ""reagent"" but they don't make reagents, they make base solvents, mainly paint thinners and common bulk chemicals like butyl acetate, used in varnishes (and according to the company 90% of that is for exports) Not rocket fuel. 

Imagining that they won't be able to produce printed circuit boards because they won't have solvents to wash the PCBs with because of this one fire is just wishful speculation. It's pretty ridiculous. The claim that this is a 'CRITICAL' supplier to hundreds of defense industries is completely unsubstantiated here. Saying in effect ""everything was centralized in the USSR so this must be their only factory"" is not an excuse to actually try to find out. There are other plants that produce stuff like tolulene and butyl alcohol. Gazprom and Lukoil petrochemical plants. I look that up instead of just saying ""AFAIK"" as if not knowing about something means it doesn't exist. There's no fact-based argument made here saying Russia's domestic capacity can't replace the loss in production (if there is one, which again, there is no account of), nor an actual argument that imports can't make up the loss if it doesn't. Just saying trade with China ""is going to be complicated on a numerous levels"" doesn't prove the case, it's hand-waving. China's far from the only country that's trading with Russia anyway.

Another really ignorant factual error is the completely baseless claim about VOCs. A VOC is an organic compound with a boiling point between 50 och 260¬∞C. It has nothing to do with 'shelf life'. Nothing. A compound's volatility has nothing to do with chemical stability. That's just completely wrong, more wishful speculation. The products the Dimitrevsky factory produces such as butyl acetate, isobutyl alcohol, tolulene, acetone, metyl acetate have essentially indefinite shelf life if stored correctly. 

But let's all pretend the Russian war machine is going to come to a screeching halt in a month because of a warehouse fire, because it's more fun to live in a fantasy than to think critically. Sigh.",2022-04-23,u7w8nf,i5tzagy

He also really believes forged shitty history books written in Moscow on how everything in the world is really Russian in origin and how Russians are the most ancient people.

Also the factory has not been working properly for a long time. Stopping the production on a regular basis. And even when it was working it still produced very few modern tanks. As far as I remember it was something like 14 tanks Armata. None of those are in Ukraine. I don't no why Putin's generals don't use them, but if I had to guess, my bet is that these tanks are not battle ready and probably made for show to excuse the stolen money that were given to their development and production. 

So, what Putin really spends most of his money for? Well, there are no real analysis to speak about, since criminals don't share such information. However, it is basically a common knowledge that Putin's has to pay a lot to his - soldiers, special forces, national guards, KGB agents, government clerks, government owned corporations and their employees (most of the corporations are unprofitable and have been for a long time due to corruption), TV talking heads who spreads his propaganda and so on.  

This is a huge amount of money he has to pay. And he stays in power as long as he has the money to pay. All these people he pays to are protecting his regime from Russians. It is literally what made him president in Russia and did not let Russians to kick him out.

Russia had something like 3,000 battle ready tanks at start, and another 6,000+ rusting hulks of T-62s parked in ""storage"" in Siberia for decades. The pictures of the latter look absolutely dreadful, and it's estimated less than 10% are fit to drive, due to severe corrosion and the looting of valuable parts.

There is not much in the way of munitions that is easier than making dumb HE artillery shells. People have been making, and improving them for 150 years.

  
What is involved?  
- Make a mold.  
- Cast the body.  
- Machine the nose and back end.  
- Fill with explosive  
- Screw on the back cap  
- Provide fuses to be installed at the last minute.  
- Propellant charges are in a separate can, and is just a can with primer and propellant charge.

  
There are a few other details, like the rifling bands, but the main thing is to make the shells the same weight and the same outer shape, so the same artillery aiming tables can be used.

  
One smart artillery shell probably does the job of 50 or 100 dumb artillery shells, when attacking a single object, like an armored car. But there are times when firing 100 or 1000 shells are what you want to do.

But polling numbers from dictatorial countries are notoriously unreliable and sharing them without an asterisk actually plays into Putins propaganda. It is of course possible that indeed 80% of Russians support the invasion, but it's also very likely that quite a large part of those 80% didn't give their actual opinion for fear of prosecution. One also needs to point to the existence of the freedom for Russia legion to see that it's not that one sided.

Russian bombardment of the facility itself alongside a much tighter perimeter and presumably discovering most if not all of the tunnel exits meant they could only resupply off of dead soldiers that had tried to storm the facility. They were running out of food and medicine especially, but also likely that whatever source of potable water they were using had run out or broken.

There was also an interview about a week before the main surrender where the commander said that the bombardment had destroyed a large freezer room they were using to store the bodies of their fallen comrades. With a bunch of sick and wounded people and no medicine, rotting corpses no matter how deep in the facility would make everyone sick both physically and mentally. They'd already said multiple times that the wounded were basically rotting to death already - any minor wound that gets infected could be a death sentence, any major wounds would just have to be treated as best as possible and then hope they don't die. It's quite likely they overall lost more men to wounds than to actual combat deaths over the 3 months. 

I think too that the sheer amount of them that had survived was a major factor. If they'd been whittled down to only a hundred or so men then it's easier to fight to the death than around 2000 soldiers just sitting there waiting to see if dehydration, illness, hunger or combat kills them first. The sheer number of them left means it's going to be harder for Russia to disappear ALL of them so we'll eventually know what happened and then other countries can start doing things like saying the sanctions will last until all the surrendered soldiers are returned.

16313,"There's a simpler solution to Ukraine's artillery woes: manufacture 152mm shells to send Ukraine. Ukraine has about a thousand guns that use this ammo, far more than Western supplied tubes.

But here's the bigger problem: this shit is old. And bad. Their accuracy is terrible resulting in a lot of wasted shots. What you want is ""sten"" precision weaponry... Make something like Excalibur shells but without busting the bank just to maximize its edge-usefulness. Make the cheapest precision weapons possible that just about do what it's needed to do without trying to showcase the limits of what can be done.

What if you want the precision of Excalibur, but the target isn't 40 miles away? Waste a $70k shell that you only needed half its capability for? What if you want the range of Excalibur, but just wanted to saturate an area rather than hit the commander's tent perfectly with the first shot?

This is why for all the fanfare around Excalibur, almost nobody is buying them. Because for a tenth of the price, you can buy the M1156 precision guided kit, which just screws onto a normal, dumb 155mm round and turns it into a GPS guided round. It can't travel 40 miles, but how often do you need that? And if you do need that range, why not use something like HIMARS instead? 

Or for little more than the price of a normal dumb round, you can buy M795s which give extra range. Not quite as much as Excalibur, but still enough to outrange other artillery. 

As for the artillery pieces themselves, the problem isn't production, since these aren't being produced by Ukraine they're produced by the west which has deep pockets, it's a matter of political will. The West has enough working guns *in storage* alone to happily arm Ukraine to the teeth. Finland alone has 1,500+ artillery in service. It's politically easier to send a few very capable guns than a lot of low quality guns, since people really only look at the headline number. If you only have the political will to send 12 howitzers, better give them 12 of your best howitzers than 12 of your worst. As Zelensky pointed out, if NATO gave 1/10th of its equipment to Ukraine, Ukraine would win this war very quickly indeed while barely making a noticeable dent on NATO's firepower. 1/10th would work out to roughly 1,500 tanks, 1,200 artillery, 2,000 combat aircraft, 11,000 armoured vehicles.",2022-07-07,u7w8nf,if98ax6

A better way to think of it would be to look at how Russia has won most of it's battles over the last 2 to 3 months - massive amounts of shelling to blow up any cover or defenses and the Ukrainian soldiers, vehicles and equipment etc and then pushing in to force them to either retreat or fight without any real defenses. 

Ukraine has been steadily attacking the Russian rear with the HIMARS so far. They're destroying ammo, supplies, logistic capabilities, barracks, vehicles and air defenses. As a result it looks like Russian shelling has drastically reduced along most fronts and they're resorting to launching rockets and missiles at civilian targets in cities to force Ukraine into surrendering. At some point Ukraine will start concentrating fire on one part of the frontline instead of everywhere and will essentially be able to do the exact same thing Russia did except with more precision - blow up any significant defenses in an area then send in some tanks and infantry to clear out anyone left.

There were a lot of reputable international organisations monitoring the situation in the Donbas, including the OSCE (of which Russia is a member), the OHCHR and Amnesty International. None found anything close to the allegations suggested by the Russian Government.

Nobody talks about Minsk though so I‚Äôll rant a bit about that because it summarises the situation in my opinion. The original Minsk II is in Russian (that totally banned language remember) but here‚Äôs an English translation. [https://horlogedelinconscient.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Minsk-2-Full-text-UNIAN.pdf](https://horlogedelinconscient.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Minsk-2-Full-text-UNIAN.pdf)

Take a read of it. It's only 3 pages long.

Now Minsk II required certain constitutional changes, but was fairly vague on what these were to be. That isn‚Äôt unusual, international agreements are normally pretty vague. The point is to provide a framework to work towards in boring behind the scenes discussions. And this was the problem.

After Minsk II was ratified, Ukraine passed a law which, as per the agreement, approved special status for the Donbas and called for local elections, much to the annoyance of Ukrainian opposition politicians who thought it was giving into Russia‚Äôs demands.

So Russia must have been pretty happy with this right? Not quite, they criticised it because the elections were to be held legally under the jurisdiction of Ukraine. There is nothing in Minsk II which says this is an issue, but Russia was making it one. [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-status-idUSKBN0MD1ZK20150317](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-status-idUSKBN0MD1ZK20150317)

Now normally this would just be a little wrinkle to work out behind the scenes. So Ukraine approaches Russia to discuss it, and Russia refuses. Why? They claimed they were not a party to the agreement, but were only mediators ‚Äì like France or Germany. If Ukraine wanted to discuss it, they would have to discuss it with the LNR and DPR authorities, who were the real parties. https://tass \[.\] com/politics/865384

Only, Ukraine couldn‚Äôt discuss it with the LNR and DPR authorities, because to do so would be to recognise their legitimacy, which they can‚Äôt do until they hold elections. And we go in circles.

So who is right? Was Russia a mediator along with France or Germany, or were they an actual party? Take a look at the document for a hint. [https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/5/b/140221.pdf](https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/5/b/140221.pdf)

There are no signatures from France or Germany (mediators). Russia‚Äôs signature is the third from the bottom, alongside the DNR and LNR authorities (parties to the agreement).

Russia is essentially demanding Ukraine implement sweeping constitutional changes, based on a single paragraph of text, while refusing to talk to them about what they will view as acceptable based on an arbitrary (and easily disprovable) legal distinction. Instead they sit back, wait for Ukraine to try to implement it, then say ""No no that's not right, why are you refusing to implement Minsk?""",2022-06-09,u7w8nf,ibrnx6x
16332,"There are so many sources that it would take quite a lot of time to gather them. And it's pointless since none of those will make the Russians think they are mistaken.

\- the legitimately-elected President was illegally deposed

No, the President was not illegally deposed. He fled the country. It wasn't like he was captured by the opposition and overthrown, no. One morning he simply disappeared and the next day he shows up in Rostov city in Russia. 

So what to you do when the President abandons his post? There is no precise procedure for this case. The law only states that if the President is unable to perform his duties, it is the Head of the Parliament who assumes the President's duties until a new election is conducted. And in order to initiate the new election the Parliament made a political decision to end the President's term prematurely because he was not planning to return. There is no specific law that describes this particular procedure because no one ever expected a President to run away from the country. But there is also no law that prohibits it, that's why the Parliament was absolutely legally entitled to make this political decision. 

And that's what Russian propaganda picked up and spun as ""illegal takeover of power"". No, it was absolutely legal, the Parliament did everything in a democratic procedure and according to the law and the Constitution.

\- The illegitimate Ukrainian gov't then sent in the army, and Russia decided to defend the Russians living there

No. It's the Russians who started the war. 

They started it by sending their saboteurs to overthrow local authorities in several regions: in Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Odessa. These were armed military people obviously from Russia, supported by some locals. Ukraine was able to quickly react to those events, although it was tough and the saboteurs almost succeeded in some of the cities. 

Kharkiv, Kherson, Mykolaiv were a complete failure for the saboteurs, they didn't have any local support and no success at all. 

In Odessa there were heavy clashes between locals: civilian pro-UA protesters vs. pro-Rus protesters supported by some organized crime and even local corrupt police. It resulted in a deadly standoff near Labor Unions building where the fire in the building killed dozens of pro-Russian protesters - this was picked up and spun by Russian propaganda as well. Eventually the Odessa situation was contained and pro-Russian forces and corrupt police fled. 

But in Donetsk and Luhansk it was much worse. There was just not enough pro-UA support from the locals, they consumed too much Russian propaganda over the past years and were generally more pro-Rus than pro-UA. Google for a Donetsk pro-UA peaceful protest rally, where a pro-UA protester was killed in clashes. 

At some point in Donetsk and Luhansk the cities' administrations were captured by armed saboteurs. First gunfights started to happen in the cities. And that was the moment when the Ukrainian authorities decided to deploy National Guard. An absolutely rightful and lawful response. And no, those saboteurs were not local. They were Russians. Some of them tried to disguise themselves as local, some of them openly confirmed they were from Russia. Later we all would get to know that they were led by Igor ""Strelkov"" Girkin - former GRU officer. In response to Ukrainian deployment of the National Guard, the Russians started bringing heavy equipment and arms across the border. And thus the war began.

\- the Ukrainian gov't was persecuting ethnic Russians in the Donbas

No, never. Actually, why the hell is it you who should supply sources to counter this bs argument? It's them who should give you a source: who, how many, when - was being persecuted for Russian culture.

\-Russia tried to make peace with Minsk agreements, but Zelensky wouldn't honor it

Once again, facts? What are their sources to prove this claim?

Minsk agreements wasn't something pushed by the Russians, it was something pushed by the Europeans. The Russians used Minsk to their own advantage. They wanted Ukraine to officially recognize the Donbas region that they captured as an autonomous region with wide legal power and independent administration, to change Ukrainian constitution to declare Ukraine as a federal country, to apply Russian as a second official language and so on. This was not and never will be acceptable for Ukraine, because it was obviously a trap set for future annexations of Ukrainian regions by Russia.

Ukraine pushed for Russians to withdraw their forces, to return the control of the border to Ukrainian military. And only after that Ukraine would discuss autonomy of Donbas. This was not acceptable for Russia.

That's why the Minsk agreements were doomed to fail: they were never satisfying for any party. The long negotiation process bought Ukraine some time which helped restore the country economically and most importantly restore the military. So Ukraine was winning in the war, that's why the Russians had to directly intervene to inflict damage to Ukrainian armed forces to force Ukraine to the negotiations table. This was the reason why Minks happened in first palace. And this was the reason why Minsk-2 happened, after Ukrainian armed forced almost entirely destroyed the separatists and Russians intervened and almost destroyed UAF. Google Ilovaysk. Minsk-2 was more in favor of Russia's demands, but still it wasn't satisfying for neither side and negotiations stalled in lack of constructive progress. Ultimately, this became the reason why the Russians made the decision to resolve their cause militarily - hence the full scale invasion of 2022.

\- Russia was forced to defend the Russian-speaking peoples

Nothing threatened the Russian-speaking population in UA. Absolutely nothing. Donbas region was peaceful and prospering resource-rich industrial region of Ukraine. Before Russians started this bloodbath in 2014.

Russians are the greatest threat to Russian-speaking population in other countries.

That it's not an issue of NATO expansion, it's the issue of  NATO being purely defensive in nature. Russian diplomats did have a bad reaction after the intervention in Serbia, especially considering that Serbia is their ""orthodox historical brother slav nation"".  


So it would alarm them that ""Hey you say that this is defensive only, but you're attacking Serbia, did they attack you!?!"" and also the NATO Libya bombing. That one I really don't agree with, I still remember the news media declaring ""Gaddafi wants to make a rape caravan"" e.t.c and a lot of hysterical stuff. Then after the no fly zone NATO bombed the great man made river. I was critical of that, of what basis was that about protecting civilians? I felt it was a bad sign of the future of Libya. Then No Fly zone wasn't just no flying, it then was followed by bombing gaddafi's convoys directly and his son was killed, then special forces helped guide the rebels to eliminate Gaddafi.  


So Putin was furious about Gaddafi's death because obviously he's scared that one day the people will do that to him, so that probably pisses him off as well. The actions of NATO in Libya kind of poison all this talk about a ""No Fly Zone"" and why it will never happen. If NATO declares a NFZ then  immediately China most oppose it, also it brings up old wounds, a lot of people are still not happy about what a NFZ meant for libya. And some also for Serbia. All Putin would have to say is ""Well if you do that I will nuke"" and it will immediately fracture NATO as it goes from Putin making a mistake and bludnering an unprovoked war, to 'aggressive NATO is expanding and trying to forcefully bully Russia'. People in the west will be divided and won't want to risk or be going on the offensive against Russia and many international countries will take sides e.t.c  


  
I think the fact that they go after the simple argument of ""NATO is expanding blah blah"" shows it isn't actually about NATO, they know NATO won't attack them. It's purely a talking point.  


Anyway it's clear it was never about NATO expansion, it's just a talking point and it's a sore point because we know it quells their ambitions for expansion, subjugation and creating satellite states and a sphere of influence. It's clear that if the baltics weren't already in NATO we could be facing a crisis now of them trying to manufacture separatist movements in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia also, not just  Ukraine.",2022-04-23,u7w8nf,i5uu1lh

> the Russian decision to double down is a high-stakes gamble. If Russia mobilises and eventually overcomes Ukrainian resistance then NATO will face an aggressive, isolated and militarised state. If Russia loses then President Putin has now begun radicalising the population in the pursuit of policies that he will struggle to deliver. Failure to defeat the Ukrainian state after relentlessly comparing it to the Nazi regime may have serious consequences for Putin and those around him. To frame a conflict as existential and to lose must necessarily call the suitability of a leader into question among Russia‚Äôs political elites. NATO states therefore need to consider how to manage escalation pathways that follow if Russia is not only defeated in Donbas but finds its newly mobilised and poorly trained troops, with few remaining stocks of precision munitions, unable to deliver a victory in the summer. The death of Putin‚Äôs political project is plausible, but it has already inflicted immense damage internationally and risks doing considerably more.

2.  there's no way to tell with the fog of war, but if we go by the equipment losses that are visually verified on oryx, i'd side with the ukrainian number and slap a 20% propaganda margin on it. if assumed those are just the killed in action, times that number by 2 and the total will give an impression of casualties. in any case, too many to sustain their advance. without putting a number on the total casualties or killed in action, we can verify the axis of advance of the russians has grinded to a low pace. they took izyum on the first of april and have barely moved 10 kilometers west and south of izyum 29 days later. either they got their head up their ass and can't work a compass or they've got some serious issues down there they had to solve before pushing up further.   

3. absolutely, ukraine has structured its defense around a defense in depth doctrine. essentially its manoeuvre warfare but on the defense instead of on the offensive. they remain highly flexible and mobile. if ivan shows up with a motorstrelski to take a point, they put up resistance. if that's enough to break the attack, great. they stay in place and await the next one. if it isn't enough to break an attack, they fall back to the next line of defense instead of remaining static in a fight to the last man. this creates a situation where the ruski's get trapped in a pocket of their own making on which nearby ukrainian units launch counter offensives on from the flanks. if that's enough to push the ruski's back, the ukrainian unit that fell back from the point moves back in and the cycle continues. if the counteroffensive fails however, all ukrainian units simply fall back to the next line of defense and do it all over again. this repeats every field the russians cross, every village they take, and everytime the ukrainians fall back to the next line of defense, their forces become more concentrated and are able to put up a bit more resistance than previously.  this keeps going on untill the ukrainians are forced to fall back within the local cities of the regions they defend, where heavy urban combat ensues stalling the russian advance even more. and if the resistance in those local population centers isn't enough to break the russians only then the region will be abandoned, after which it all repeats in the next region. if the coin flips the other way, and russia exhausts its offensive capabilities, thats when ukraine seizes the oppertunity to take the initiative and launch a counter offensive.

imagine using the liveua map as a source for territorial control lmao.

anywho, here's what's going on with that territory.Ukraine has structured it's defence around a defense in depth doctrine. they do not set up their defence in a very static spread out line around the border, where the russians could engage one point in a single battle, push through and then surround the rest of the line.

instead, their defense is layered and revolves for a large part around delaying the enemy, rather than prevent them from moving up.the way this works in ukraine is that their units don't hold static positions. rather they remain manoeuvrable and flexible. when ivan lunges forward with a motorstrelski, the ukrainians put up a bit of resistance. if that resistance is enough to break the attack. great, the unit remains where it is and awaits either the next assault or makes ready to support the next unit down the line if they're the ones being assaulted.

however, if ivan is determined to push through with the attack, the ukrainians simply pack up their shit, fall back to the next defensive line and radio in to the units around them that they're doing so. ivan gets to take the point, sure. but the surrounding ukrainian units now have a motorstrelski caught in a pocket and get to work on it. again, if the counter attack at that point is enough to break ivan into a retreat, good. the unit that fell back from the point now moves back into the point and the cycle repeats.

however, if ivan brought enough manpower and is able to hold off the counter attack, ivan gets to take the point. when it is clear this is the case. all ukrainian units simply pack up their shit, fall back to the next defensive line and the story repeats. in the meantime artillery from the rear of ukraine works on the russians as the ruski's now have a forward point in which to set up their assetts, regroup or reorganise from the previous assault and get their shit together to do it all again. this keeps repeating untill the ukrainians have literally had to retreat in to the city's on the east. from where they fight the ruski's on the streets in urban combat and again, delay them as much as possible as the next defensive line behind the city's is established. it all amounts to a very frustrating situation for the ruski's in where they have to fight multiple battles for a little bit of terrain, and even when they get that little bit of terrain they get to do it all over again for the next objective they'll have to take.

this is examplified by the defeat russia suffered around kyiv. the battle for irpin/hostomel/bucha.  but also down in makariv to the south west of kyiv. where the ukrainians allowed russia to overstretch their lines, only held them in urban terrain and in the meantime ambushed the russian supply line. this is much the same on the east of kyiv. for 30 days the russians attempted to take kyiv, and suffered so many casualties doing it, suffered so many losses in their logistical abillity they had to give up on kyiv completely. their only ticket to a swift end of the war and they lost it. they were defeated.

if you remember the salient of a few motorstrelski's that tried to bypass mykolaiv by driving up north towards the closest bridge over the bug river by voznesens'k. they were utterly defeated in the same way.

more recently, we're seeing ukraine succefully go on the counteroffensive by kharkov. where they applied the same strategy and worn down the russians so far that they are now incapable of even mounting a defense against the ukrainians. and keep in mind that by kharkov, russia's supply lines are shortest. across the border lies belgorod at roughly 50km's from kharkov and yet the russians are incapable to even supply their units not even 30km's away from a major logistical hub for this invasion. today both ruska lozova and momotove were liberated from russian control and there's fuck all the russians in that area can do about it.

so, lets take a look at the russian succes stories so far. the first week of the invasion, they got their way and were able to embark on these rediculous salients capturing towns, strategic crossroads and a few city's. i'd say kherson is the most important one. but after ukraine mobilised, got their shit together. it's where it ended for the russians. the eastern front has been absolutely static on the russians end for 6 to 7 weeks already. beyond their initial results there's very sparce actual tactical victories for them to celebrate.

most recently, they were able to take izyum after a long and quite hard fight. but since then, what have they achieved? they've been able to push maybe 10 kilometers to the south and to the west of izyum. where we see the ukrainians acting out their defense in depth again. if the russians cross fields to try to get the next little village, they get hit. if they succesfully capture the village, they are largely unable to destroy the ukrainians who defended that village, and on their way to the next village, guess who'se taking shots at them? the same ukrainians from that first village. and that keeps going on, and on, and on, and on, until after suffering losses, and fighting for every kilometer they reach the next midlly urban area. where they encounter the concentrated forces of the ukrainians who have been tormenting them all the way to get there.

if you look at it objectivly, the territory controlled by russia in ukraine is not even 20% of the country, and without total control of the country, removing the leadership and subjugating the populace there can be no victory for russia. without the total destruction of the ukrainian armed forces, or at the very least destruction to the point where the ukrainian military can pose no threat. there is no victory for russia. there's just more war to be fought.  and if you take in perspective the losses russia has suffered so far, just by looking at the known losses posted by oryx. russia simply does not have the capability to keep this up forever.

in the meantime, ukraine is grinding them down. sure, they give up a little territory but ivan is paying dearly for it.

TL;DR; russia isn't winning, ukraine isn't losing. we're in round 3 of a 12 round boxing match. and ukraine is still standing, still fighting.

16437,"Indeed, although there are plenty of smart munitions in the West that'll make your head spin.

The newest Excalibur artillery rounds, as well as having a 70km range in certain configurations, are laser **or GPS** guided with autonomous targetting. They can scan the ground with radar, identify targets such as tanks, and home in on them targetting the weakest points on the vehicle. They can chase target vehicles travelling at least 70mph. The shell's fuse can switch between an airburst, contact, or penetration detonation depending on the target.

Meanwhile, newer missiles like the British Brimstone can do all that autonomous targeting, while communicating with dozens of other Brimstone missiles in mid-flight to ensure they each go for different targets. If there's more Brimstone missiles than targets then they attack one after the other, assessing which targets should be hit a second time. 

We're finally coming to the point where modern, miniaturised processing power and sensor capabilities, of the kind found in our smartphones, are being applied to battlefield munitions. Switchblades are okay, but they require the operator to spend the entire time piloting it, trying to spot enemy targets on a screen.

Russians, such wonderful people! They came, raped, looted, killed, sent Estonians to Gulags and Siberia. Took our freedom and made us second class citizens for 46 years. The Kremlin put a huge number of Russians into Estonia and Latvia to Russify these countries. Russians didn‚Äôt care to learn the local language. They told to us ‚ÄúSpeak the human language!‚Äù (Russian, of course.)  
  
In the 90s after occupation, they told us that ‚ÄúWait and see, mother Russia is coming back, your independence is temporary.‚Äù They didn‚Äôt care to learn Estonian or Latvian language.

Russia is a real country, Estonia isn‚Äôt even a real country.

In 2007 we removed one Soviet memorial statue with a Soviet ‚Äúliberating‚Äù soldier from our capital Tallinn, because Estonians had enough of watching that rapist-looter-killer-occupier. Russians started rioting-looting in our capital. In that moment in our country the police didn‚Äôt exist, all our police forces were sent to capital to manage ‚Äúuprising against Nazi government.‚Äù  
  
In the 90s and until around 2015 they called us nationalists-Nazis who oppress them. That in Estonia the state language is only Estonian is oppressive.  
  
Voting patterns (many do have Russian citizenship) have shown they support Putin even more than the Russians in Russia.  
  
Now in 2022? Ukrainians are Nazis who oppress Russians! Washington‚Äôs puppets! Ukrainians are dumb, they don‚Äôt understand what is really happening! To get enlightened what is really happening, one should consume Russian TV and online portals. Estonia is the 4th country in the media freedom index (Russia 155th), but everything in Estonian media is shit and fake news, Washington‚Äôs propaganda.

We all also know many proud Ukrainians already have Russian as first language, just by virtue of the parts of Ukraine they were born in. 

Many fight against Russia and get bombed by Russia just like their compatriot ""Ukraini-glots"" and they hate Putin just as much.

It saddens me to sometimes see remarks suggesting that they are somehow less Ukrainian or less anti-Putin.

Few Ukrainians seem to discriminate against ""Russi-glots"" just because of their mother tongue but some do. Not wise - it pre-judges the person and  gives Putin something else with which to distort the truth and brainwash his population.
