0,uhm thats quite the increase . i also heared they were recently testing some emergency infrastructure in the baltics this week they havnt before .
1,poland also announced that they plan to double their armed forces from 120k to 300k and increase military spending to 3 % of the gdp . theyve been calling for the rest of nato to increase their military spending as well .
2,"remember , nato knows more than were being told . thats an alarming amount of troops at the ready ."
3,"well done , putin . top 2022 salesman of nato . before this stupid , cruel war , germany didn't want anything to do with nato , the bundeswehr was underfunded and the population didn't care for soldiers , poland started to push against the eu , orban was openly speaking out against the entire eu project , spain had troubles of possible sedition ( catalans ), the entire peace project between nato/eu states was slowly crumbling . europe lacked a common goal , something they could all rally behind . financial prosperity was no longer enough . member states didn't want to pay for military , they had their naive bubble that europe would stay at peace , forever . and now putin managed to unite the entirety of europe . nato is stronger than ever before . whatever putin tried to achieve , he failed . russia is weak . their military is a joke , compared to the entirety of nato . ukraine is a relatively small country , with no navy , little high tech gear - all they have is an iron will and the passion to defend their homeland from evil . and the ' superpower ' , as some believed russia to be , failed to defeat that . they threw everything they had at ukraine . their most advanced weapons . their best troops . they used other nations to secretly attack ukraine from the rear , against all international laws that have a meaning . they used mercenaries in secrecy , spies and traitors in ukraine to give them unfair advantage . and still they failed . the only thing they didn't use are nukes , but those would lead to war with nato . ukraine is too close to the eu . meaning they threw everything they had and could . before , putin was on one dictator level with china . now , china has more leverage . they will dictate the years to come in that dual partnership of darkness . it's only a matter of time until the russian elite manage to get rid of putin , one way or the other . he has become a liability . he is no longer giving russia stability and prosperity . he forgot why and how he rose to power ."
4,"very good decision - russians are incapable of understanding diplomacy nor they are to be trusted in any matter . the only thing they understand is strength , so if they wanted 300k of nato soldiers waiting near the border for russians to do something stupid - let them have it ."
5,this looks familiar ...
6,"finally , a move to respect"
7,where are these forces stationed ?
8,"putin is not going to stop with the ukraine . if he successfully takes ukrainian , he will take more ."
9,"you wanna play intimidation games , putin ? well we're something of an intimidator ourselves ."
10,"nato : go ahead , f around and find out ."
11,good . about time . the orcs just bombed a mall
12,"even as the complete and total pacifist that i am , all i can so is good ! it's necessary - especially for the baltic countries . this is the deterrence that is needed , and in the circumstances , the best hope for peace in the region ."
13,it feels like we are actually sliding into ww3 holy shit . would it be so out of the question to take putin out ??
14,just move already rammstein base to poland and call it sabaton . i bet sweden approves : d edit : thx to our german friends now we all know that there is rammstein and ramstein :)
15,isn't it quite embarassing for a country to have like whole world against them . it's even worst what nazigermany was dealing with .
16,"sounds like nato leadership knows something that is not pleasant . putin may want to start incursions into somewhere that may invoke article 5 . mauybe because of moldova , maybe the baltics via belarus . russia is out for blood . the reply needs to be firm and break its back . nobody likes russia , russia is not an empire and will not have one , russia has no right and has always been a terrorist bully state with some weird self obsession . stay the fuck away from nato territory or fuck around and find out ."
17,and so it begins chapter 2 . belarus
18,"i don't want war , but at the same time i want the war that is going on to stop before more children are raped , kidnapped , or killed . in many ways i just want russia to step over the line and force nato to act , in which case i'd give russia about a week before every militarily significant asset is wiped out ."
19,lets wipe these fucking orcs off the face of the earth
20,what an odd time to do this did something unseen change ?
21,this is extremely significant . thats not a defense force . thats double what russia sent to ukraine . and double the forces that participated in d-day . something is going down .
22,"wait , what the frick , what happened ? why this sudden increase ? don't get me wrong , i am more than happy to see my taxpayer money being actually used and this info gives me a much needed feeling of safety , but what happened ?"
23,"makes you wonder what we're being kept in the dark about , opsec obviously , but they know something and need to have forces there to hold and counter until the rest can be dropped in ."
24,lithuania should pull up the train train tracks from russia to kaliningrad . destroy them and every piece of infrastructure associated with them . make sure russia understands this is not a spat over sanctions - this is there is no more train track for you cunts to roll on and never will be again. 
25,so twice the number of troops involved in the d-day invasion force
26,i wonder how much this has to do with the upcoming food shortages . 
27,do you have a source on this besides the trash fire that is sky news ?
28,"so double the size of the russians invasion force , how nice ."
29,war seems inevitable now .
30,hello stop loss my old friend so nice to hear from you again
31,ww3 is brewing with near 100 % certainty . this is bread and butter stuff before any war in the history of mankind .
32,those troops should help ukraine fighting fascism .
33,so we're at defcon 3 now ?
34,ww3 is here . were only just waiting for all bets to be off .
35,ngl these news are increasingly worrying me . this mad orc needs to be stopped !
36,"aww shit here we go again , three-peat time ."
37,"what did russia expect ? i know they want to keep goal posting and changing the status quo on almost everything from the invasion , to end goals , and international law . but to the extent that thier demands are blatantly lunatic and unrealistic in comparison to nato ? i get they are doing this intentionally to undermine nato being for "" defence "" to change the international narrative but how do you justify slaughtering and dislocating millions for this ?"
38,putins only way out is war
39,ahhh fcuk . it's about to go down isn't it .
40,"us has their ear to the walls of the kremlin , must've been something juicy making the rounds to prompt this level of response ...."
41,boy that really escalated .
42,genuinely concerned putin expands the warwhat does he have left to lose ?
43,damn dude my wife is qrf and were on our honeymoon . bad timing
44,"nato needs to put more boots on the ground and deterrents to russian invasion in the baltics . i agree with the estonian pm - what good does it do to retake a territory when it's cities have been leveled , it's people raped and decimated and its culture effectively eliminated ."
45,mid-july 1914 mobilization flashbacks
46,"kremlin threatens nato ... i mean wtf he expect , another phone call ? dudes a maniac , wont stop till russia is dust ."
47,aaaand this is how it starts . welp . hopefully we get at least one more year before shit hits the fan .
48,good move . russia is accelerating their mobilisation . we cant wait until its too late .
49,idk if you guys picked this up but this means nato likely has intel that were going to war soon . no other reason would we have 300k troops mobilized and pre-staged with equipment if we didnt believe a war was about to begin .
50,that does not sound very good . i hope the war does not escalate and turn into world war 3 :(
51,escalate now . escalate yesterday . escalate months ago .
52,about time given what's been going and has been said .
53,"they also take weeks to be gathered very close to the russian borders , but they will not attack ;]"
54,[ removed ]
55,""" one defence minister has said that there cannot be a "" bucha on nato soil "" - a reference to the town of bucha , outside kyiv , where russian forces are accused of mass murder , torture and rape of ukrainian civilians ."" - how about on any soil , anywhere ? :("
56,these ruskies arent that dumb
57,they know what's coming . we're only delaying the inevitable wwiii .
58,as a history buff i always wondered what the build up to a world war felt like . now i think we all know .
59,"wwii , here we go ?"
60,true it's because of the new kremlin rhetoric about taking back all land that once belongs to russia and increasing tension with lithuanians .
61,"yeah , i mean do they know some shit is about to go down ?"
62,"its only an increase on paper - the armed forces of places like poland , lithuania , estonia , etc were already on alert and now they are coordinating under nato rather than individually still significant , but not like there was a big change on the ground . expect to see training soon which is a great excuse for troops from various countries to get together somewhere like poland"
63,i think its over kallingrad isolation and upcoming sanctions where nato will be ceasing russian oil tankers . definitely ratcheting up tensions .
64,gearing up for war .
65,men i may not like the policy of our ( polish ) government but they are killing it with the response to ukraine . we are not fucking around and i love it .
66,i am polish and everyone here is wondering where our government is going to find those extra 180k soldiers .
67,most americans have been saying that for decades .
68,"oh boy , i wonder what we germans will do"
69,"that makes no sense , poland already spending 2.2 % of gdp on the military , a incrase to 3 % doesn't pay for 150 % more ."
70,"that , plus the advanced weaponry that ukraine currently doesnt have access to . thats a huge force and its unlikely youd 7.5x your available troops if you didnt think youre gonna need them . us intelligence has been on point with regard to pooptns plans , they know whats up ."
71,its not only for ukrain though . this could also be in regards to a russian/chinese alliance and issues is the south china sea . its a statment that not just nato is ready to defend itself . its a statment about a massive increase in military strength of western democratic nations .
72,someone has to keep order after the kleptocrats ' house of cards has collapsed .
73,"there is also the potential that it's intended as a strong deterrent . as in "" don't even try it "". the kind of deterrent that europe forgot about and the lack of may have helped lead to this current situation ."
74,my wild guess is they'll try to provoke a conflict somewhere in northern finland to prevent them joining incase a deal with turkey is achieved .
75,"its probably a deterrent . now that they see the war grinding to a halt , russia defaulting on its debt , and the lithuania crisis , they know the time is rife for potential escalation and are warning russia to stand back . also , its gonna take a while for all of these troops to be ready , its not exactly something that materializes overnight ."
76,"but they also know that russia would literally get molly whopped . i mean , they would get absolutely devasted by nato forces , no contest . russia's best units are fucking junior varsity in training and equipment by comparison . surely the number is more to signify that not only are the seriously overmatched , but outnumbered to boot . that might be what it takes to convince a mad man losing his marbles not to do anything stupid ."
77,last time someone amounted this many troops at the border they invaded within like 2 months .
78,nobody has pissed off the world this much since hitler 
79,"this is the truth . putin claimed he wanted to prevent nato expansion , and he has accomplished the exact opposite . politicians were starting to question whether we even still needed the alliance . but putin has guaranteed that nato will be larger , more relevant , and more united . he proved precisely why nato needs to exist . and russia will be hated by the world for a generation , at least ."
80,he remembers well how he rose to power and was able to maintain it . chechenya then georgia then ukraine in 2014 . 3 times is enough .
81,not to mention this is a war on their border and they already suffer with logistics .
82,"i hope , when arrested , putin is not killed and no one allows him to commit suicide and escape like hitler . putin needs to be trialed and if death penalty is given , i hope that he is given the same medicine he gave to navalny or lietvenienko ."
83,ukraine is a relatively small country - its the largest country on the european continent lol
84,he didn't fail to destroy and ruin the future of another country . russian troops are still strongly implanted into ukraine and it will take years at best to get them out :/
85,"putin came to power through a genocide of the chechens , and he'll lose power through another genocide ."
86,forgot macron almost ousted by a russian troll
87,"> ukraine is a relatively small country eh , it's as large as combining poland and germany end to end . small by what metric ?"
88,"> they threw everything they had at ukraine . their most advanced weapons . their best troops . i would say this is categorical not true . now i'm not going to arm chair how technologically superior or un-superior russia actually is , but we know that they have historically used conscripts as their bulk of troops , just as we have seen them do again in ukraine . thier most advanced weapons ? i think we know what their most advanced weapons are , and we all hope to god they do not eventually use them ."
89,"yes this is a major strategic move . the total operational commitment is unknown....make it a huge surprise if the situation escalates . kaliningrad should be blockaded , just like odessa , and prevented from allowing critical goods into russia . sooner or later , you draw a line in the sand...its time ..."
90,"other articles mentioned that it's going to be focused in the ally countries that neighbours russia . which means nato heard us and we can feel more confident in baltics , poland and hopefully soon finland ."
91,"most likely in poland , the baltics and romania or smth like that ... oh and norway but they won't say exactly where and how many becuase , well , opsec"
92,"in all nato countries . the 300k is the rapid reaction force , they must be able to get mobilized and on the hot spot within 5 to 30 days . brits , french , canadians , spanish rapid reaction forces etc . - the whole nato rapid reaction force totaling 300k - could be sent to for example poland or the baltics within 5 to 30 days if there is a crisis . this reminds me of the cold war when we had mobilization exercises that also tested our response time to get into west germany . it was a dash to counter / stall any invasion by the warsaw pact while everyone was mobilizing . given that this is the rapid reaction force , the total nato military is much , much bigger . at this moment the us alone has more than 1 million military personnel ."
93,"those who have swords , but keep them sheathed will inherit the earth ."
94,"being a pacifist is naive . its hasnt seemed so for a while , but it has always been naive . hopefully this is a wake up call to distance ourself from china , instead of making ourselves dependent on what has always been a ticking time bomb ."
95,"lets just hope we have the capability to strike russia so hard and so fast , that their nukes never come into play ."
96,its more of a deterrent that nato planning an offensive
97,"don't want to be a party pooper , but the airbase is called ramstein , the band rammstein ;)"
98,hell yeah we do . putting gothenburg on the map again !
99,"rammstein is a band , the air base is located at ramstein ."
100,i hope this chapter ends as quick as it begins
101,"we dont want russia to cross the line . russia crossing the line probably means ww3 , and you only need a week to eliminate humanity ."
102,"the article is just bad , they are talking about the nato's respose force . which are forces with a higher readiness rate than most military units . able to deploy into a conflict area within 5-30 days . they are at the disposal of nato's supreme allied commander europe . this is a big deal that nato feel like they need to increase the response force so drastically but it's not like they are putting 300,000 soldiers on high alert right now in anticipation of something happening ."
103,"300,000 is a strong defensive force that reduces losses in comparison to a 150,000 strong offensive army . the larger number doesnt make it offensive , it makes it more confidently defensive until it makes steps into opposing territory ."
104,"["" estonias pm says country would be wiped from map under existing nato plans ""]( this quote from like 5 days ago at the nato summit . basically the old plan was to allow the baltics to be taken and then reclaim them in 180 days . the estonian pm pointed out bucha happened after in under 80 days so it's inhumane to just expect them to weather such atrocities . i think they even said they felt like they were expected to die with the old plan . so pretty sure this is them changing strategy to better block russia at the border rather than the tripwire old defense which the article goes into more detail about ."
105,thats a were ready bitch . bring it! force
106,looks like nato is ready to defend the baltics if shit hits the fan .
107,might be a move do draw russian forces to that border and relieve pressure from ukraine .
108,"assuming it is , the attacker ( russia ) still has the benefit of choosing when/where to attack in consideration of mostly static defenses ."
109,"nothing is "" going down "", this is a structual change that will take a long time to actually implement ."
110,you realize this amount of troops is planned for late 2020's right . there's no immediate relevance . no idea why this garbage is upvoted . it's purely defensive
111,> thats not a defense force the only way that would make sense is if nato had decided to attack russia . i don't think that is likely ( except if they have rock solid evidence of an attack to come ).
112,it's a display of force . it might lead putin to back off short-term .
113,"g7 had a meeting . bojo said "" ruzzia can't be trusted to treat , they only understand force . if the ruzzians are permitted to benifit from their actions , they'll just do it again . i never liked this british prime minister before . however i really think i might stop calling him bojo ."
114,"feeling of safety ? gives me the exact opposite . i hate the reddit mad crowd , but they have a point ."
115,"i don't know about that , lithuania wanted reassurances , russia has been threatening a lot , nato makes sure lithuania feels safe and russia doesn't do anything more stupid than usual . i would bet it will stop at that , and it's all public knowledge ."
116,err ( estonian national television ) reported on this as well . it's accurate info .
117,why is sky news trash ? i like them
118,"well , what can you do ? kneel before the tyrant ?"
119,ww3 started february 24 .
120,yeah but we didnt have nukes in the past . sh*t like this happened all the time in the cold war
121,putin is defcunt 1 definitely a cunt
122,this is a defensive action - something that each nato member state is sworn to chime in .
123,"the population of all nato countries put together is just short of a billion people . finding 300,000 out of a billion means you're using way less than 1 % of your population ."
124,i would guess it's mostly an ' on alert ' kind of thing with the bulk of the forces made up by militaries already in region .
125,"lol , america has 1.3 million on active duty alone . and another 800,000 reserves . add in the rest of the nato countries and it comes out to somewhere around 3.5 million ."
126,"non-us troops wouldnt have to be ready because the us already is . the us military can mobilize and deploy our quick reaction forces any place on the globe within 24 hours . in the case of eastern europe that time is dramatically cut . the us currently has [ the uss harry s . truman ]( carrier strike group in the mediterranean for the purpose of defending natos eastern flank . that group alone can defeat many nations air forces by themselves . and , from what we have seen from russia , they are on that list . we also have the [ uss kearsarge ]( and the 22 marine expeditionary unit in the baltic sea . they , along with other nato forces , have been engaging in joint exercises called operation neptune strike and operation neptune shield since last october . they are all ready to defend and go on offense against russia within a matter of hours and they dont have to travel to get there . then there are the forces we have in poland , germany , and lithuania . the us military and the military of those nations have been integrated and prepared to fight this battle for decades . they have had all the assets they need and the means to move them . dont worry about finding people because there are more than enough people , drones , jets , helicopters , tanks , defense systems , ships , submarines , an aircraft carrier , and munitions to put an end to it before they would ever be needed ."
127,"nato countries have 3,37 million active soldiers ."
128,"that's the thing , most of these aren't us troops lol ."
129,nukes used to be a deterrent . now its a commit war crimes without repercussions card .. what shit existence life is .
130,"that and them freaking over lithuania being like "" nah bitch "" to trains/trucks to kalingrad"
131,"it's possible . with russia defaulting , putin is definitely being backed into a corner and maybe nato intelligence indicates the russian government is considering expanding the war and this is a tactic to signal to putin that that wouldn't be a very good idea . ideally , if russia launched other attacks to the west , having forces in place would stop advances that , while eventually turned around , could cause serious damage before troops are mobilized ."
132,"not necessarily . it takes time for these types of forces to be organised and train to full effectiveness , if you wait until an imminent threat appears it's too late . plus a strong defensive force is a better deterrent , and it's better to prevent an attack than have to fight ."
133,"it does matter . no one , not even russia , wants nukes to happen . ww3 starts with one nuke . no country will stand with them after that ( bye china and india ). russia knows it cant take on nato , full mobilization wont help them . they do not have enough men or weapons ."
134,stop fear mongering .
135,poland doesn't intend to disappear from the map again .
136,"ive been feeling the same about our uk government . i despise almost all of what they do , however we have not been giving russia a break and im all for it . you dont carry out a chemical attack on our soil and get away with it ."
137,same and same . your country is and has been commendable in their actions toward the conflict . thumbs up .
138,is it really a polish government if it didnt do what it could to flip the bird to russia ?
139,they just want to win votes . how do they plan to finance that ? 25 % vat ?
140,"also .. poland already spending 2.2 % of gdp on their 120k military , how are 0.8 % more supposed to pay for increasing it by 150 %?"
141,if they cant recruit 180k now with russian aggression when will they be able to recruit them ?
142,hashtag thanksputin ?
143,"i don't get why though , if nato were to get into a war with russia , they would easily be able to beat them , where is the need to spend more ?"
144,us and british intelligence . people underestimate the effectiveness of british intelligence . but perhaps that's good ...
145,"> its unlikely youd 7.5x your available troops if you didnt think youre gonna need them . its not . they arent needed for combat , they are for deterrence . its like flashing a gun if that crazy aggressive hobo starts to walk towards you(russian threats towards lithuania ). furthermore it's not a "" heres 300k troops at russian border "" it's a "" if russian soldiers crosses the border , 300k troops are already ready to deploy in a moment's notice ."" the current approach was rather to trust our intelligence reports and only bolster defenses as russia would increase their offensive troops on the other side of the border(e.g . in regards to ukraine last winter ). this move is "" we'll keep a defensive force ready to deploy ... better ready than sorry ."""
146,that's scary ...
147,isnt finland protected by nato during an application process
148,people have willingly signed up to fight for a country they've never stepped foot in because they realize how evil putin and these russian troops are . putin has to pay mercenaries to force his own army to fight because they don't want any part of it .
149,well . stalin .
150,"exactly . this is not a break from normal playbook . it is an escalation , emboldened by past success . this time he just made the mistake of not leaving himself the plausible deniability of it not being a full scale invasion with regular troops of areas the west cares about . if all they'd done is occupied the donbas , they might have got away with it , to the shame of all the rest of us , like they did crimea . putin has been fucking around for years , and this is the first time he's found out ."
151,"rather have him caught , confirmed , shot , and buried in a shallow unmarked grave all in the span of an hour . no media , nothing . just move on from him ."
152,isn't the largest russia ?
153,"technically they can get out of ukraine in a few days , but yes i agree , once you start the war you won't get out of it just like that ."
154,"hes obv speaking bigger picture . yes its fucked up whats going on in ukraine , but on the global politcal power scale this was a massive fuck up"
155,"> they have about 850k soldiers and another 300k reservists . they also didnt use the best stuff yet , like the high altitude tactical bombers or all the modern tanks , same for the top 10 elite battalions that has the job to guard moscow and some important borders . also , they didnt use any of the high modernized tanks/apcs and jets . i mean , they have used the tu22m3 . they just have not used it inside ukraine for fear of it being shot down . the same goes for the su57 . that has only been launching missiles from within the russian or belarussion borders . however , they have deployed the ka-52 attack helicopter , the t-90m , t72 including in obj 2016 variant , ifv's and apc's in all their various loadouts , high end ew vehicles etc etc . sure , they have not deployed 850.000 troops , but i honestly doubt they could support those numbers . they're already struggling to keep their current deployments supplied ."
156,"north korea also has a large army , a million soldiers , so what . untrained with low quality equipment are as useless as fake cardboard tank cutouts and only there for power projection ."
157,> or all the modern tanks you mean the t14 they have in irrelevant small numbers and can't produce anymore because the reality is that imports of critical hardware and their economy is fucked ? the same t14 that we have no proof of how good it is ? \\\_()_/ 
158,i hate to burst your bubble but there is plenty of evidence that many of russian elite units were involved since day 1 . try googling it . literally .
159,"finland doesn't need nato troops , probably better to station them to the baltics ."
160,"thank god ! id read the concerns over the nato plan should russia try anything and was disgusted . like why not establish a solid front line to ensure none of the baltic states were overran in the first place ? does it not benefit everyone from vilnius to tallinn and provide needed reassurances for safety ? its in nobodys best interest to see lithuania , latvia , or estonia suffer ; nor is it anyones best interest to see this war in ukraine compound a global food crisis . hopefully yall get the 25k + troops requested per country ."
161,"norway has a no base policy and only a small rotational training force from the usmc , not far from where i live . if a nato force was arriving of any real size , they wouldn't be able to hide it - not least because people like me in the home guard would be called on for guard service when they are landing the heavy equipment , just as they do whenever there's a nato exercise . and there's no reason for nato to hide its force in this case , they are operating on their own territory , while the whole point is to show strength and make it clear for the russian regime what it would be facing . and aside from that , hiding the overall movements of 300 000 soldiers with plenty of mechanised units is impossible today , even from the russians ."
162,"yes , the less they say the better...makes for a bigger surprise party for putin . surely he cant be that stupid....or can he ?"
163,"hopefully not all of them . iirc russians have conducted military exercises where they used tactical nukes against nato military formations , and should shit hit the fan i expect they'd be used against the largest concentration of troops ."
164,"this . disarming yourself to keep the peace is good , as long as everyone does the same . being able to possess the threat of violence to defend yourself and having the restraint and maturity not to use it for nefarious purposes is even better"
165,meh . it depends how it is expressed . i am against violence - but that didn't stop me from studying karate for self defence when i was younger . doesn't mean i ever wanted to need to use it .
166,"yeah sigh if nukes come into play were all finished , the world wont exist with humans after that"
167,russia will keep escalating until they are stopped . period .
168,you need a 3 to 1 numerical advantage over a defender when attacking
169,finally . no more of this tripwire force bs .
170,"nuh bro , it's not it , it smells different"
171,"yeah , it's not 1939 . any moves and build ups russia makes will be known to nato in real time ."
172,where is your source for this claim ?
173,"right , as we all know if it was offensive , we wouldn't know about it until the 18th airborne corps had boots on the ground . 24 hours from notification iirc ."
174,how is 300k not double ?
175,there are about 150k russians in ukraine .
176,"no , continue calling him bojo . helping to handle whats going on ukraine is the only good thing hes done . hes a cunt"
177,i was basing my opinion on them being owned by rupert murdoch's news corp . looks like it was sold in 2018 though and has since improved .
178,its a right-leaning source . anyone who identifies as liberal will hate it .
179,"fuck no , don't you dare misunderstand me ."
180,"it's kind of a one sided world war though . china ain't going to join in , there's no benefit when they can just get a piece of the russian remains later ."
181,"not officially , that's when the prelude started ."
182,not in european theater it didn't .
183,that was excellent .
184,"that's ... plausible enough . we shall see , i guess ."
185,"that's the crazy part about this escalation , trains and trucks can still go to kaliningrad , they just can't transport sanctioned goods through the eu to get there ."
186,i am so proud of lithuania . i grew up with many lithuanians in chicago they were great people . but they had a thing once they made there mind up about something it was near impossible to talk them out of it . i do not think the eu can do it even if they wanted to .
187,which they knew is going to happen and they still fake surprised pikachu face
188,"they still allow trains and trucks but no trains and trucks with sanctioned goods . lithuania is complying with the eu sanctions . russia can still access the region through the baltic sea no problem . ( just making it clear , because some russian trolls / shills have talked about blockade and how lithuanians are trying to starve people in kaliningrad . that is utter nonsense .)"
189,well that happens when there is a special logistics operation going on
190,"that's what russia wants you to think but they only block 3 % of traffic in accordance with eu sanctions , but russian media push it as larger than it is to justify a war goal against lithuania and you're only proving it worked ."
191,well its easy to be like that when you have nato backing you ...
192,"honestly i don't think he cares about the default . it is minor and it is not like he needs to borrow money right now ( or could , if he wanted to ). i am more concerned about the situation in belarus ."
193,"that sounds reasonable . i would love to hope you are right , but i just hate to use hope as a strategy ."
194,they don't have enough to take ukraine but that hasn't stopped them trying .
195,[ deleted ]
196,i'm just now realizing how dark yet historically accurate your phrase is .
197,"it won't , no matter what the russians try . poland has too many friends ."
198,our foreign policy response to russia is good but i don't necessarily count putting a kgb agent's son in the house of lords as being that stringent . nor handing the spectator and evening standard to that same oligarch .
199,poland ball laughs last .
200,"probably light infantry , i guess ?"
201,"excellent question ; nato is not just there to fight back - they're meant to be a deterrent to any threat , before it becomes viable . you deter threats by making it so costly and difficult to invade , or attack , that the other side doesn't even consider it a truly viable option . the thinking is this ; it's better to have it and not need it , than it is to need it and not have it ."
202,"future . russians will learn from the current conflict , develop a new army which won't be based on current decrepit shit from soviet era since most of that will be spent on current conflict . then they will attack again in a decade or two . it's not a question of "" if "" but a question of when . and we don't know where this attack will take place . but nato needs to be strong and remain as a deterrent ."
203,i believe the sentiment is that america had been contributing a disproportionate amount of support to nato relative to other members who benefit all the same .
204,"you don't wanna beat them ; you want it to be child's play . beat them at the expense of several of your cities being burnt to the ground isn't the desired outcome . while nato would beat russia , russia is strong enough to injure nato . you don't want it to go 8 rounds and leave the match bleeding . you want a first round ko with and keeping your skin baby smooth . that requires a lot more power than we currently have . you also don't wanna commit everything you have to russia . you need to be able to defeat russia and still have enough left to defeat some other threat at the same time . ideally , you gotta be able to beat both china and russia at the same time . if you can't do that , you're not strong enough"
205,we're mostly seeimg increased military spending in countries closer to russia . my take is that this is so that russia wont think about pulling something like crimea against one of the baltic states since there is a lot nore military presence in or in the vicinity of the baltics plus its popular agong voters who dont want to be licing under the threat of russia
206,"i guess because nobody wants war , so show of force might be a deterrent ?"
207,"i would imagine that the quicker we flatten them , the less casualties we suffer . i'm not a military expert though , so that's just my guess"
208,"the usa could easily beat russia . france or the uk might be able , too . but the rest of nato absolutely could not . that is why the rest of nato is spending more . because it has just been proven that russia is willing to attack and they realize that they could not stop russia without american backing ."
209,"i have an answer for this one . us bears the burden on protecting the world and has since forever . that's our money . that's our blood . what do we get in return ? western europe laughs at us and looks down at us for 100 different reasons . american sentiment that led to trump was "" fuck em "". "" let them foot the bill for once "" "" let them see how difficult it is to maintain a huge standing army/navy/airforce ."""
210,it's a large country
211,"funny thing about war : you never know how it goes until it goes . besides , the us have certain serious inner conflicts that might escalate soon . that would remove nato's silverback gorilla , and things would look a lot less one-sided then . i still have no doubt we'd win , but in matters of life and death , let's better be safe than sorry . i wish my own government was this resolute about defense in this situation ."
212,well its more about overcoming the equipment ratios that russia can throw onto the battlefield . ( the estimated stock of russian armor ) from what i understand the nato playbook has always been the use of small tactical nukes on armored columns to overcome the tank to tank ratio . now it seems the west have tried to make that up with better quality weapon systems but even those have limits . take the us m1 abrams . even if they went full bore in production they would only be able to produce 300 tanks a year . they calculated the amount of battle losses they could absorb in a conventional fight and its about a year ? and that's just a standard m1 not including the modernized version with its recent upgrades which they claim they can do 20 or so a month if asked .
213,did you learn to speak english from duolingo ?
214,the uk was the only country at one point who was adamant that kyiv wouldnt fall when the russians where on the outskirts of the city . the uk knows .
215,"we talk about them like they're different organizations - but they're five eyes ( along with canada , australia , new zealand ). all our intelligence agencies work together and have access to most of each other's data - the more pieces of the puzzle you can see , the easier it is to fill in the missing pieces . also israel is often called the sixth eye , for their near-full inclusion in the group . for any assessment like this , cia is looking at mi6 data too , and conversely gchg is basing their assessment on nsa-collected data too , and etc . an american-intercepted oceanic fibre-cable-splice , could be decrypted in australia , and analyzed in cheltenham ."
216,if only they'd have intercepted the russian meddling into brexit though ... i do wonder what their masterplan was . divide europe and conquer it ? glad other eu nations didn't follow the uk
217,i mean if they'd stop getting drunk and either fucking or killing the leads that'd put them on top lol
218,"it also * might * help ukraine , because if nato is massing troops on the russian border it means that russia is forced to hold more troops and equipment on the nato border leaving less to go into ukraine . so this is an expensive and complicated way of indirectly helping ukraine ."
219,"it is , but since when has russia taken rational and understandable choices ? they just thew 2 iskandr's at a mall in plain daylight ."
220,"well to be fair , this is as black and white war as it can get . a blatant imperialist naked aggression where the aggressors are basically taking the geneva convention as a checklist of things to do while other side is fighting for their survival and to keep their loved ones from being genocided . after few decades of military adventures to places where the justifications are somewhat morally ambiguous and many lines are a bit blurred this must seem to be a chance of being on the good side without significant mental gymnastics needed for a lot of jaded veterans . although its obviously a fair bit more complex and there are many different reasons why people sign up for that kind of stuff . for example , russia has got away with a lot over the years and some guys and gals might be in it just for a payback . whatever their reasons , they are fighting for a just cause , in my opinion . that horde \* must \* be stopped in there and hyopefully in an painful enough manner that they will not even consider trying something like that for a generation or two , at least ."
221,ukraine might just be the spanish civil war of this century .
222,and it's about time . you'd think we'd have learned from hitler that placating these fools only emboldens them and strengthens their position . you need to punch the bully when he starts shoving and name calling . not after he's made a routine of taking everyone's lunch money .
223,"i'd rather him be kept alive in abhorrent conditions , the same way he's treated dissidents himself . treat him to the same psychological torture he's inflicted on others . that way he can see as russia prospers without him and see how he's viewed akin to hitler for the rest of his days . watching his whole life and legacy be completely destroyed while he's completely powerless to stop it . i think is a much better punishment . death would be too easy a way out for such a monster ."
224,dump him in the sea . no grave then
225,"nah , just hang him and leave him to rot away while hanging . let dogs eat his bones for whatever they are worth ."
226,kept in a perspex transparent cell 2 metres by 2 metres and toured around europe . allow a small hole at the top so people can piss in it until the level reaches the top unless he drinks enough of it !
227,the rest of europe talked it over and decided russia could be its own continent until china agrees to annex the ryssa welfare state ...
228,i mean once you install families + the pro russians helping them are going to be tough to remove \^\^'
229,"yeah i too totally understand the shear number of bodies they have at their disposal , but i highly doubt they actually have the equipment for those soilders . i don't think they're holding on to massive quantities of modern rifles and giving mosins to front line troops in ukraine . it wouldn't make sense to do that at all . is there a bare minimum of supplies to protect the homeland and moscow ? of course but that will never be used in ukraine . the only time it would be in use would be all out war with nato . in that instance russia wouldn't get a chance to use that material . atleast not a large chunk as it would be destroyed in minutes , from the other side of the world , with having to put one soldiers boot on the ground . the us might have the means to completely disable russia without even having to fly soldiers and equipment out there . if they did , you can 110 % be sure that we have to planes , with proper maintenance and support ready to go in days , troops in a week or two at most . nato could match that 850k and some . the us and turkey alone have around 2,000,000 troops and that's just 2 of dozens of member states . if you think russia has tue capability beyond fighting locally you're seriously mistaken . it's almost a joke now but i doubt they have enough functioning and maintained long range cargo and support craft . the 2nd largest military in the world , couldn't blitz a small and under supplied nieghbor , fighting nato would be futile at best . the majority of russias advanced tech is either vaporware , or manufactured in such small quantities that they couldn't engage long term ."
230,"will all of that is true they still havent even used 10 % of what they have . even if they have inflated numbers in russia , and even if corruption runs deep , they arent that incompetent , they simply underestimated ukraine and thought they will be welcomed ."
231,"never did i say that . the t14 is just a tank that never sold outside of russia and is just a paper tank anyway . they wanted 2500 of those but only build like 30 in total . it will never be used but russia likes the propaganda behind it , just another russian/putler paper wonderweapon ."
232,"not the ones who have the responsibility to guard its main interest , the elites that they did lost was the highly praised russian paratroopers and airborn units . they practically lost all of them ."
233,even a small number of nato troops would be symbolic that finland is seen as nato even before all the formalities are complete .
234,"finland needs them , just as other nato countries need finns . nato is about sharing the best resources of each country for mutual defense ."
235,"once finland joins , it will be a part of nato you know ."
236,because the baltics do not provide any infrastructure to have so many troops stationed right at the border . that's why . and because it costs a fuck ton of money and is generally not really feasible to stop them right at the border .
237,"> like why not establish a solid front line to ensure none of the baltic states were overran in the first place ? because that's crazy expensive and hasn't been needed until now . lithuania joined nato in 2004 . we've had 18 years of not needing it . now it is needed , and is being ramped up ."
238,"it was because it was not assumed possible . with the russian army being as effective as , well , the russian army this is now considered possible ."
239,"remember what you read is not the nato plans , it's propaganda by baltics asking for more nato support . they had a very strong incentive to paint a picture of the situation as pessimistic and bleak as possible . a nato command point of view would certainly have been very different , claiming current provisions are enough - troops on the ground ready to slow down any attempt to blietzkrieg , intelligence that would see troops massing in advance , enough planes and ships and fast deployable troops at the ready to react to any deterioration of the situation . now they answered the call to make a show of strength , it's some posturing to dissuade russia from attempting anything stupid in lithuania ."
240,"i could imagine norway moving their own forces towards the border with russia . thats technically still "" nato forces """
241,not sure i agree with that . imagine all 200-something countries on earth has nukes
242,eh not really true . we'll still be here just with higher cancer rates and much fewer people .
243,"> you need a 3 to 1 numerical advantage over a defender when attacking an army of equal capabilities , right ?"
244,"that ship sailed long ago...everything nato does is sold to their people as aggresion , everything nato doesn't is sold as sign of weakness followed by russia stronk chestbeating . don't get yourself fooled by russian propaganda . this isn't path nato chosen , it's the path putin keeps dragging it along ."
245,i agree . but only a lunatic fool would decide to go down that path in front of such a military reaction power .
246,"look at the state of his tanks , boats , infantry , etc . now consider that a nuke is 100x more complex than a tank , and requires constant maintenance . you think theyll fly , or detonate correctly ?"
247,"not sure how else bring it bitch translates for you , but in this situation it sounds defensive to me !"
248,"well , let's think about the possibilities : 1 - nato might be thinking about joining the war . the reason why it's a less-likely possibility is fear of nuclear retaliation , though they are more than capable of rolling over russian army in ukraine . 2 - nato is expecting a russian attack . what makes it look unlikely is thessame point as above about nuclear , and the fact that russia is weakened after months of war and definitely not ready to take nato head on . 3 - nato sees a benefit on having increased readiness , such as an overwhelming show of force would dissuade russia from doing anything stupid ( like forcing their way to kaliningrad ) that they might otherwise be tempted to do if there's no immediate reaction force , and deal with consequences later ; showing support to baltic states , calming their fears and leaving no questionmark to them or to russia wether nato is willing do defend them by all means necessary ; making russia chose between letting their flank vulberable to an overwhelming nato force or repositioning troops that could be used in ukraine . to me 3 seems the most realistic ."
249,"it really does . it could be a matter of when , not if , the war escalates beyond current borders ."
250,tell that to crimea .
251,"my source for what ? nato high readiness forces are just regular forces that have to be ready to deploy in anywhere between 48 hours and several months . first of all that needs preparation , it's not done with signing a piece of paper , it will require some serious work . currently preparation for natos very high readiness joint task force is in the years . second of all it's very much * not * what you do if you're gearing up for an invasion or expect one shorty , or whatever that comment was supposed to imply . in that case you don't work towards having 10 % them ready to be deployed more quickly , you just deploy them ."
252,ground combat troops . the number of people involved is much higher
253,"as a person not in/from the uk , i'll defer to your judgment . but ,.. but maybe bojo churchill ? i can't help but appreciate his intense support of ukrainian defence . i bet you the first foreign military/air force/navy , that enters the war against ruzzia , after poland will be the uk . wouldn't be surprised if bojo is the driving force to bring others together so they can all declare a conventional war on ruzzia together ."
254,"also the timing of that "" let's ride horses shirtless to show putin who's strongest "" joke was ridiculously badly timed ..."
255,"ah my bad , i guess you could interpret that in many ways"
256,china might nuke russia if russsia gets stupid edit more stupid .
257,combine all nato country troops and you have a standing army of around 3.5 million . so less than 10 % is on high alert .
258,nato has over 3 million personnel ( civil & troops ).
259,ok . your point ?
260,and ships . ships could still get to kaliningrad from st petersburg . i guess maybe they are down one escort cruiser ?... >\ _ >
261,"i mean they did do it to comply with eu sanctions and they did communicate it with other eu governments beforehand , they just didn't tell russia about it until 24h in advance , which was to be expected ."
262,"am a lithuanian . proud of my ancestors for fighting for and ultimately saving their national identity , despite orcs trying to erase it for centuries ."
263,"lithuanians are hard as hell . they make some seriously vicious kickboxers . remigijus morkevicius , for example ."
264,just hung out with my lithuanian grandma this friday ! she was from chicago . i got to hear so many amazing stories .
265,"why would the eu try to talk them out of it ? they're only implementing eu sanctions , not going rogue trying to hurt russia independently or something . this is a team effort , stop making the eu out to be the bad guy ."
266,"make the lithuanian polish commonwealth great again . .... anywho . but historical jokes aside , they're doing a great job standing up for what's right . assuming a russian meltdown , would they potentially want the kaliningrad oblast ? ( if that were even possible ). it's old prussian , but i'd imagine lithuania or poland is the closest thing to the right country nowadays ."
267,like it s blocked the same ways as odessa .
268,i think its a counter to russias ability to cut off gas from europe . its their only year round non frozen port .
269,"how am i proving it worked . this is literally the reason the kremlin is going spastic right now . me relaying the reasons moscow is giving for their recent tantrum is not me proving their propaganda is working . they told lithuania to knock it off , and lithuania said no then putin got his panties in a twist . the quantity/type of goods aren't relevant to that point ."
270,what would possess you to think he doesn't care about the default when the only thing he cares about lately is reestablishing a version of the russian empire and cementing a legacy of greatness ? it's the worst thing to happen to russia in his entire time in power and will cripple the russian economy for a generation . whether russia wins the war is insignificant compared to this .
271,"the fact that its a public move is indicative of the fact that its more posturing by nato for russia to stand down , if this actually had something to do with a plan for war i doubt that information would go public"
272,"> i just hate to use hope as a strategy . that is exactly why this is happening . nato is getting ready to defend itself so that it doesn't have to rely on the hope that russia won't be stupid enough to attack...again . nato will not start anything and the stronger nato is , the less likely russia is to attack ."
273,"uh , the person i was responding to had their comment removed , was that you ?"
274,"ah now i can see you changed your original comment an hour after i replied to you . that's why your comment was removed i'll bet . you might be ruzzian ruble army . the comment you wrote , that i replied to , said ruzzia only needs one nuke to destroy all of nato . you changed it and thought "" no one is as clever as you ?"" you probably took off work early today so i won't hear any reply from you ."
275,you said ruzzia needs only one nuke to destroy all of nato . then you changed your comment . i answered your question why don't you delete the bullshit you posted after ?
276,"0.8 % of poland's gdp comes to about $ 4.75b that would be about $ 26,400 per soldier for those 180,000 . that's not enough to pay them let alone training and equipment even if you make them the lightest of infantry"
277,"i agree with the last part , but nato is already so much more powerful than russia . i think our current defence should be detterent enough ."
278,i din't think the russia that stands today will be anywhere but a starving nation with a very low birth rate in the next 20 years . they have literally obliterated their future breeding generations .
279,they don't have them demographic to pull this off . their population is declining . check out peter zeihan's take on both china and russia .
280,well then america should consider investing less in their militairy .
281,"first of all , we need to kick the nasty russia oil and gas habit . we are paying the russians billions of euro for oil and gas they pump out of the ground for free , and they are using the profits to invest in our destruction . we are financing russia's war on us ."
282,isn't the point that an attack on one nato member is an attack on all ? why compare individual nations to russia ?
283,so why don't u spend less on your militairy then ?
284,> i understand the nato playbook has always been the use of small tactical nukes on armored columns to overcome the tank to tank ratio . where the hell did you read this ?
285,"no from an us citizen who told me what to do , seems to be that us people haven't always the best interest of others in mind . grow up ."
286,they share a lot but being closer to the target always helps .
287,"the conservative party were complicit in that particular russian meddling . there was actually an [ overt pro-russian grouping ]( in the british conservative and unionist party . they disbanded just after the attack so it wasn't awkward for them , but they absolutely did exist and [ served putin's interest in the british government ]( they backed boris johnson . the conservatives were up to their necks in russian corruption ."
288,british intelligence were actually ordered by the government not to look into russian meddling in the uk . just one of the absolutely outrageous scandals of our conservative government . not a failure of british intelligence .
289,"basically distort reality with false information then elect your dictator , 40 + million people bought into it in america . im surprised putin let that much power slip away , or maybe trump was a happy accident for us in the end ."
290,brexit would have happened without russia though . to imply it was the sole reason gives putin far too much power and legitimacy
291,"theoretically , yes . but i think in practice , russia knows that nato is a rational non-aggression actor despite russian propaganda . they know nato isnt going to "" you know what would be fun ? invading russia and murdering its citizens !"". that's more of putins shtick ."
292,that is a fair point .
293,honestly before this started i didn't even think there would be a war so black and white in modern / future times
294,> dump him in the sea . no grave then this bin-ladens the putin .
295,we have to prevent his corpse from being collected by nazi sympathizers . russians not knowing the location will be crucial . edit ... a mobile crematorium would actually solve that issue .
296,"handing out passports , and deporting ukrainians in the donbas and crimea clearly shows that even if they completely retreat , which i doubt they will , it will take generations to fix the mess that is left behind there . this region has been damaged for a long long time , like the balkans was ."
297,i don't think tbh any russian family will love to move to ukraine now . but anyways those people honestly believe that ukrainians troops will just crucify them the first day they enter the city/village .
298,then the mass kidnapping victims who are somewhere in russia can be repatriated . that should be a nice quick task for these logistical geniuses . im recalling the americans losing all of those children from their own border camps and at least at face value saying we dont know where they are. 
299,after the war they will have to live with the shame for the terror they have caused . they will be hated for a long time . i think most of them will hide inside russia to avoid trials .
300,"that's the only modern vehicle that has yet to be used , they have used their latest tested hardware in ukraine . so if you didn't meant that then i have no clue ."
301,"people seem to misunderstand me , nato troops are most welcome to finland . what i meant was that the troops mentioned in the article could be of better use for the baltic states than finland , we have lots of available manpower unlike the baltics . what we probably need is more anti-air and help with air patrols . there are going to be nato bases in finland , what kind and for what purpose remains to be seen . in the mean time nato should take care of the defense in the baltics as best they can , we are still being blackmailed by turkey and are probably not joining any time soon ."
302,"you misunderstand me , read my other comment ."
303,"that is entirely beside the point , we both know that was not what we were talking about . finland has a very good army and does not need additional nato troops stationed that could be of better use in the baltics . what we probably need from nato is to bolster our anti-air even more and help with air patrols over the baltics and the gulf ."
304,also lithuania has the us already there in camp herkus/pabrade . it has 500 rotational us troops and they just added more and now its around capacity . the f35s are at siauliai . germany uses the base at rukla i think ? the us special ops are just somewhere noone has specified where other than in lithuania . i think we have maxxed out our current capacity there . most the us troops being sent over are going to germany . we have doubled how many we have in germany this year but still have alot of room left . i think we are at max capacity in poland also with around 10k there . total us troops in europe is currently over 100k .
305,"is it propaganda or necessary preparations given historical interactions with russia , putins rhetoric , or perhaps the very knowledge you talk about them having in advance . i know nothing of how their militaries or intelligence services work , but ive read the baltic states are notoriously good at disassembling soviet bullshit . which this entire global domination plan from moscow is . theres a reason people started drilling with their firearms months ago . they want to be as ready as possible . to some its paranoia , but look to their history as to why . soviet occupation was painful , the last thing they want is to see russian imperialism control them again ."
306,"our national plans are already based on the assumption on a russian invasion across finnmark and troms , with our bases positioned accordingly ."
307,"the credible threat doesnt have to be nukes . you can have a strong conventional military force , its just that one has to develop the discipline to not use it for problem solving or expansionist ambitions"
308,"true , but is it a bad idea to plan in advance ? nato was founded for this exact reason ( russian aggression ) so using the forces for that makes sense . not worth taking any chances ."
309,"trust me i'm not fooled but you've got to weigh every action and i think it's very interesting that nato has decided to put its big boy pants on . its a massive change in language from the west , some of whom were talking about peace talks not that long ago ."
310,"ohh i hope so mate , i hope so !"
311,hilarious people think i'm defending russia here .
312,"i worry about russia using belarus to escalate and cause pressure on the north . zelensky found that threat credible enough to speak direct to the belarusian people . i also worry about the rumoured civilian false-flag attacks . like in chechnya , russian spies would blow up a couple of apartment blocks then blame ukraine ."
313,"its definitely 3 , especially with russia making threatening statements regarding the crisis in lithuania"
314,"ukraine wasn't as close to nato as they were in february . perhaps no one was watching the border , or perhaps the us didn't see an issue with what was happening when it happened , at the time . if theyre sending 300,000 troops to the border , they'll be watching russian troop buildups on the border , lmao ."
315,that nothing is going down and also to support your claim that these forces will take a long time to be implemented . i assume that means you are aware of what nations are sending in terms of how many troopscan you let me know where you are pulling this info ?
316,"there are about 150k russians in ukraine . total . i.e . "" thats double what russia sent to ukraine """
317,"im pretty sure any british politician in his position would have had the same response , save for the most pro-russian bootlicker . i only see what bojo is doing as a feeble attempt to win back popular support . but , i understand how good all the support is , and i certainly like all the equipment being put to good use ."
318,china has a no first use policy of i recall correctly . they have been some sort of buddies .. so yea .. ruzzia would have to go full retard to get nuked by china .
319,"no point , i'm just curious . but . either it is expected to happen in some future - in which case it might not happen at all given the deep shit the economy of eu and us is diving into , or it happens fast and the troops are pulled from somewhere , creating a vulnerability for likes of china to exploit ."
320,lithuania rocks man .
321,"i'm ukrainian , i'm enjoying watching your people being badasses ! < 3"
322,"was in vilnius with my girlfriend a few years ago . beautiful city , very friendly people and very interesting historical tours . loved it . very interesting bus trip from the airport , through the suburbs with soviet era looking buildings to downtown vilnius with modern skyscrapers . like riding through a time machine ."
323,this is so badass
324,even his name suggests he is a hard man !
325,that guy was criminal torpedo . kicked random girl on the street in the head while intoxicated . shame on him . he was shot down few years ago .
326,"not nearly the same way . sanctioned goods only . everything else passes , same as before . calling it a blockade is therefore incorrect . unlike odessa . as i understand , nothing enters or leaves odessa's ports without russian say so . so that's an actual blockade , at least by sea ."
327,when you're in a fist fight i don't think you care about your credit score .
328,yes it was him . you can click his profile and still see his comment .
329,"hadn't run the numbers , but reservists with helmets and rifles , and transported by rented buses can be pretty cheap . edit : oh , you are overestimating polish wages for soldiers : according to a private in the polish army gets $ 11,300 per year ."
330,"i think that the argument of nato being more powerful than russia really boils down to how the 2 forces would engage each other . where and how would the conflict be fought ? on paper , nato has impressive capabilities and a greater technological edge . historically , russia only responds to deep pain and fear . they're ruled by heavy-handed leaders , with a history of eschewing recognized agreements/treaties . you need to make the threat of war so painful that it's not even something that politicians are wanting to verbalize . this iillegal invasion has also poked holes in prior theoretical defense strategies ( and offense strategies ) that will have ripple effects in the coming decades , as leverage of technology in asymmetrical warfare becomes more common . this whole conflict has been a strategic and technological gamechanger for warfare , nato - and other countries - have much to take note of , on offense and defense ."
331,"the baltic states have been in the news recently . it seems like in a war with russia , nato expects to lose some or all of that territory and then regain it later . defending at a border is no doubt next to impossible but it's hard to swallow for those countries that they may be under russia n control for a while . russia also has a history of taking heavy troop losses . i can't see that being as acceptable to nato countries ."
332,i mean yeah but what you think is not relevant . the russians need to get the message .
333,they have kidnapped hundreds of thousands of kids . more than they wil lose in this war . all those kids will be brainwashed to defend mother russia .
334,"i do enjoy listening to zeihan , but you have to also acknowledge a couple of key factors that do have the potential to throw him off . 1 . he is using government statistics and these may be incorrect . 2 . he doesn't actually say that russia can't pull it off . zeihan says that their window to achieve it is closing . 3 . this is the kicker , zeihan often appeals to a very pro-us bias because he often gives talks to us army personnel and its important not to alienate your key audience . his views and interpretations are valid , and in some cases , his predictions bore out perfectly , but i would still be hesitant to ascribe some prophetic status to zeihan when so many geopolitical experts appear to be entirely uncertain about the long term outcome of this conflict and the larger issues emerging with china in the asia pacific region ."
335,or maybe the rest of nato should quit mooching and start pulling their own weight .
336,turns out you need oil and gas to operate a modern civilization . but you're welcome to try to live without it .
337,"russian killing , torturing , raping , looting civilians ? you feel happy because usa ? what's the logic ? btw , russia didn't vote against a un covered intervention in iraq . they were ok with that . so , stop bothering us with this fake argument ! edit : france used its veto . russia did not ."
338,it's crazy . hoping we get a documentary on it all in the not too distant future . needs to include trump's close ties with putin too and dig deep into the so called tampered election .
339,"brexit clearly hasnt stopped reduced or stop uk support has it ? in fact near enough every country in the eu are is doing less than the uk for ukraine . so whats your point exactly ? if brexit was russias plan to make them more friendly to russia , its clearly not working . the only thing you could argue it has done has removed the eus most powerful anti russian country . but its not like the uk wasnt eurosceptic until russia decided it was . its been eurosceptic since it joined back in the 70s . so , essentially , what im saying is : your clutching at straws ."
340,serbs probably thought the same thing until nato bombed the shit out of them during the balkan wars . putins threats are becoming harder and harder to ignore . it's trying to drag other nations into the conflict and they're concerned about this becoming a major threat .
341,haha
342,sadly this has been going on in ukraine for ages . stalin was deporting ukrainians and starving them to death since the holodomor in the 1930's . then ' relocating ' ethnic russians to ukraine to take their place . then they use the fact that there are ethnic russians in ukraine as an excuse to invade . the whole thing is fucking disgraceful . it's about time russia finally experiences some real consequences for what they've done .
343,"this damage is hundreds years old , but most of it is done by soviets"
344,does anyone have any more info about the passports ? someone replied to me about it saying that they were only given to those who requested them ?
345,"i believe most of rural russian still believe they are welcome in ukraine ( that they are "" saving "" from nazism ) and that it belong to russia anyway . \^\^'"
346,"not if the donbass is annexed to russia , it might then be like people living in crimea after 2014 . :/"
347,"su-57 stealth fighter , practically any high altitude bomber and its bmpt just recently got send to the donbas but will probably not participate , they just want revenue to sell it , fucking orcs . also , russia still owns lots of hypersonic missiles ( at least on paper ) and all the intelligence stuff also isnt that prominent in ukraine . 99 % of its stuff used is soviet era equipment or modernized stuff ."
348,"> what i meant was that the troops mentioned in the article could be of better use for the baltic states than finland , even 10 nato troops stationed in finland sends a message to russia . that message is : "" nato considers finland a nato member with all the protections that means . don't mess with finland unless you want all of nato to retaliate "". an additional 10 nato troops isn't going to shift the balance in the baltics . sending this type of message to russia has been what nato has existed for since 1949 ."
349,"sure , but mine's still valid - nato works in combined task forces to maximize efficiency ."
350,"better ready than sorry , so good on baltics and nato for setting up a convincing defense for dissuasion . but i'd bet it's gonna stay at that , readiness and dissuasion ."
351,good to know
352,"yeah but you can imagine all countries have nukes , and all are stable with the restraint and maturity to only use them for good let's say . you essentially claimed that as a better scenario than no countries with nukes . but i don't , i think that sounds dangerous . maybe everybody is well behaved today , but who knows what happens tomorrow ."
353,oh im all for a troop build up . should have been done the second they invaded .
354,"well we all want peace talks , but we want them lead by ukraine from a position of strength . we want ukraine to win on the battlefield , and hope they will then themselves talk with russia about peace . always has been and always will be ."
355,"i would say youre just thinking about too immaturely . 300,000 would likely be stationed across an area of hundreds of thousands of square miles . so unless russia are dropping 20 nukes your comment is a bit shit . hope this helps"
356,"i think the fact that russia plans to put nukes in a country and have them attack ukraine is a sign of something . people say we can't attack russia because of nuclear holocaust , but there's nothing to say we can't go into belarus if they attack ukraine . when in belarus if russians attack then article 5 ? or nato may have a collation of the willing to step in ukraine ."
357,"if we are guaranteed to have sufficient notice of an attack because our monitoring of the area is so complete , why the need to place troops on alert ? either the monitoring is sufficient or it isn't ."
358,"as stated above nato has a lot of well trained personnel and modern equipment . even with this large buildup , they dont have to pull enough to weaken other areas ."
359,or guy who kicked a random women to head on a street and in the end ( after few months or years i can't recall ) got shot by someone .
360,"in other post like that i saw z.savickas being mentioned . i think it's russian trolls who mention all the trash of lithuania(morkeviius , savickas what next statkeviius ( another kremlin tool ) or maybe badass paleckiukas ?) in light context in this sub reddit ."
361,the stuff that is sanctioned is about half the city's economic imports . this is going to have a severe economic impact on the area unless russia starts sending in ships for imports that will be a major headache compared to their current mode of transportation . this is why russia is so pissed off .
362,that what they think .
363,thank you i'm still kind of new here .
364,not really . russia doesn't stand a chance against nato . russia wouldn't stand a chance against just the usa and that is just one nato country on its own .
365,"i'm not clutching at straws , it was an absolute fact that the intelligence services recommended a thorough investigation into uk politicians links to russia , but the conservative government blocked it ."
366,"yeah , as i understand it , its making ethnic russian ukrainians into russian citizens , so they can justify defending ' their people ' by force ."
367,"sorry but i quoted "" all the modern tanks "". they have used them in ukraine already , that's all there's . and yes soviet era vehicles and their modernized is what russia uses the most so that's what we see . russia's strength has been vastly overestimated . the problem is the numbers ."
368,"sure , and like i said they would be most welcome . but i doubt there are going to be any nato troops stationed in finland until this turkey debacle is solved and we are accepted as full members ."
369,i am aware and i hope we can join soon to help defend europe .
370,finns aint no noobs at this !
371,"are you unaware of alert levels ? defcon , and stuff ? when youre at a higher alert level , you have more freedom to move resources . if you're not expecting an attack , its going to take a day to even get anything started , troops and supplies need to be loaded and moved to the frontlines , forward operating bases need to be built , trenches dug . if youre at a higher alert level , for , say , a week , those planes can already be loaded , orders already signed to load the troops , battle plans already laid out and distributed to commanders , etc ."
372,"i honestly had no idea morke turned out to be such a bad person . i used to follow his kickboxing career back in 2006-2010 . he was insanely violent , and would literally just go and go and go until he was exhausted . he fought at the top level , and while he was lacking in some skills in comparison to his opponents , i can't think of anyone who fought with that level of intensity . a friend of mine mentioned to me about how shitty he turned out to be . actually pretty specifically mentioned he got gunned down by an ar . how about marius zaromskis , then ? ;)"
373,sounds like the sanctions having the desired effect to me .
374,"it's definitely a major headache . they have to ship everything from st . petersburg to kaliningrad , which starts in the gulf of finland . the gulf of finland often freezes over for months at a time , making it impossible to ship anything . this is a major reason having warm water ports in the west of russia ( aka sevastopol in crimea ) is so important to them and probably the prime reason they annexed it from ukraine in 2014 ."
375,"russia doesnt really give a damn about economics of kaliningrad , they only care about re-establishing a russian empire and looking strong"
376,"if you think russia stands no chance against nato , you need to describe more . in what situation ? in what area/region ? if were talking open war with nato and russia that would be ww3 - russia has devastating capabilities to strike globally with icbms and what is still a fairly robust number of modern-ish submarines . nato needs more deterrent forces - and higher technology in the zones that serve as buffers to russia . do you believe estonia , lithuania , and latvia would be able to defend against a 1st strike ? even poland - though heavily armed - lacks a lot of tools to engage in truly modern warfare . id love to hear about scenarios where nato or even the us can one-and-done russia without also sustaining major losses , themselves/ourselves ?"
377,true on an absolute timescale . but while the us is mobilizing across the atlantic then russia can make some tactical advances . they could for example take the baltics before usa could mount a response . could the us take it back ? yes absolutely . but that will be very costly in civilian and military lives . the goal with the increase in nato forces is to have enough soldiers in the baltic to make it impossible for russia to take it in the first place .
378,"its an alliance , not a sponsorship ."
379,"dont underestimate anyone ever is all i said . dunno why people think so positive . russia did the same at the start of the war , many examples in history teach the same . dont get overconfident , zelensky certainly isnt , hes pressing every day . people in here tend to say everything will be ok . this war will continue and will become more bloody once russia realizes that they may be able to hold onto something , but the civilians wont like that and will protest . there lots of sugarcoating going on in here and all the positive stuff and propaganda , yes every side uses that weapon , gives the impression that ukraine is on the winning side . i hope they will win , i really do . ukraine is loosing 200 + soldiers each day . yes , russia has more deaths but if one side has more soldiers "
380,"if you're not expecting an attack ? hold on here . i'm confused . you said that nato would be aware of all buildups of russian troops along nato borders because "" we'll be watching for them ""."
381,we don't know him(zaromskis )
382,"it freezes but there are icebreakers to keep the sea lanes open and most large ships operating in the baltic sea are capable of dealing with small amount of ice by themselves . source : i'm finnish and things are shipped here thorough the year . e : here are actual charts for each month and ship type . just scroll at the bottom : [ as you can see , many ship types are able to operate through the year ."
383,i didn't know about the water freezing over . that goes from being a headache to being a nightmare . there is no way they can ship and stockpile everything . if i was stuck living there i would be packing my bags right now .
384,that doesnt bode well when iron refineries arent delivering iron for weapons and defence systems .
385,bro russia also knows that if they use icbms they are as good as gone . its kinda like suicide move . im guessing only viable as a treat more that practical weapon .
386,"right , they will take the baltics in 3 days just like ukraine lmao ."
387,"underestimation and overestimation happens when you do projections with incomplete data . russia has no reason to suffer a defeat for the sake of making themselves look worse than they are to lower people's guard , losing in ukraine will trash their big soviet return , they are in to scare the shit out of the people , not for mass stand-up comedy . it's not like nato is going to downgrade their army because russia performs worse anyway . russia has always been about looking strong ."
388,because of the threats ( see headline )? russia has been at war for the past 4 months ? are you ok ?
389,"a good thing pointing that out . the gulf of finland does freeze , but it takes an exceptionally cold winter and a long time before it freezes over to the point where you'd need icebreakers . like you said , most vessels in the area have some sort of ice breaking capabilities , so the ice must be very thick before ice breakers are even needed . out of 10 winters of working in that region , only once was the finnish gulf frozen thick enough for some ships requiring an icebreaker . the ship i was on had no issues with the 1m thick ice that had formed , but i had to do a close pass to free a ship that had been stuck once . that winter was extremely cold , so cold that finland required all its ice breakers further up north and had none to spare for the finnish gulf . i'm not finnish but a sailor who used to work on ice class vessels in the area a lot ."
390,i think the klaipda(lithuania ) is the dock that is most to north that never gets frozen in the world .
391,it's just sanctioned goods which are blocked .
392,"so was america in vietnam . afghanistan . france when nazi germany knocked and japan when they thought they can win against america , or nazi germany when they declared war on the soviets . or persia when it fought against sparta . so on and on ."
393,"i'm taking you on a walk back to my original point and getting you to agree with me on everything i've said along the way , lmao . you've said that we're watching the border implying that our level of intelligence gathering was sufficient for deterring an attack anywhere on nato . it implied that we would have advance warning of russia's intent based solely on our ability to track troops movements . keep in mind , this was in response to me pointing out that crimea was taken by surprise and though i didn't state it , it was done by a relatively small initial force that was then reinforced over weeks by much larger forces . that initial attack was fast , successful and required relatively little troop buildup making it hard to detect via the force tracking that you implied was enough . so my crimea point is valid . you then hedged and said you would need forces on high alert to handle unexpected attacks , attacks not anticipated based on the force monitoring capabilities you previously touted as being sufficient . i agree though because i don't think force tracking and intelligence are enough . if you're going to say and you should say that you can't rely on intel alone , then you have to have forces on high alert and enough of those forces given the terrain you intend to hold , the threats you anticipate facing and the sacrifices you're willing to make ( how much territory you're willing to give up , even temporarily ). given the size of the border with russia , 40k on high alert wouldn't be enough to not part with a single inch . why ? because russia like nato collects intel and is aware of nato's force posture in europe , especially eastern europe , giving them the advantage of choosing when , where and how to initiate conflict , even smaller conflict with limited objectives like that in crimea , should they choose to which was my original point ."
394,"the number of troops under nato command stationed across the alliance's eastern flank has reached 40,000 , nearly 10 times what it was last year . according to data from nato , there were 4,650 troops under direct nato command in february 2021 or a year before russia launched its attack against ukraine . these troops were stationed in four multinational battlegroups located respectively in estonia , latvia , lithuania and poland . then russia started deploying its troops and capabilities along its shared border in ukraine , accelerating these moves at the end of last year and in january , arguing it was a defensive move over ukraine's nato aspiration and the trans-atlantic alliance's eastern expansion since the 1990s ."
395,"vladimir putin of russia : ** it's come to my attention that you have a large number of units near my borders . i suggest that you move them elsewhere to avoid causing undue stress to my citizens .** * it's right for you to worry and it's time for you to die !

408,"whats really disturbing to me in reading all these comments is how suddenly pro-war everyone is . lets kill the russians ! they are evil idiots ! it would be easy , they deserve it ! the posts are written a little more eloquently than that , but the messaging is the same . no - we dont want a war with anyone , especially not with a huge nation of over 148 million people . everyone is a brilliant and courageous general behind their keyboard ."

410,"thats actual soldiers , not a 40,000 russian soldier count bc we now know how greatly they exaggerate their prowess ."
411,"look , no one in nato wants war with russia . russia has shown it has no restraint . so the only real way to deter russia from further "" special operations "" in former ussr states is going to be massive shows of force in those now-nato countries . it's a deterrent force , so that the countries in question don't find themselves getting things blown up by russia . basically , this is "" hey putin , think hard and fast before you do anything stupid . anything else stupid , that is ."""

463,3.5 million in reserve .
464,"those 40,000 troops are only a small part of the equation as well . nato would almost immediately establish air superiority , drones would be everywhere , apaches would be waiting behind every hill , missile defense systems from patriot to c-ram would be quickly put in place , and every single russian port would quickly be under blockade . if it escalated , the disparity between nato and russian forces would be significant , but the disparity between the capabilities of those forces is just incomprehensible . nato has almost twice as many total personnel , but those personnel are about 10 times more capable ( arguably much more than 10 times as capable ). in short , it would be a turkey shoot ."
465,"so putin failed to take ukraine , tarnished the facade of russian military might , destroyed his country's economy , convinced two historically neutral nations to apply for nato membership , and convinced nato to bolster the troops on his doorstep by almost tenfold . everyone called trump a russian plant , but maybe putin is actually a nato plant . edit : this is a joke . it's not a defence of trump ."

508,"russia invaded ukraine because they wanted ukraine to cede the territories of crimea and donbas to russia . they were banking on a quick surrender by ukraine , which would have greatly increased russia's power in negotiations , and if ukraine had agreed to recognise the territories as russia then the rest of the world would likely have followed suit . all of this nato , denazification and peacekeeping talk was just grasping at whatever to create a pretext for the invasion . this land grab is all due to hyper-patriotism and ambition among russians ( and their leaders ) who want to see russia returned to its former glory . i doubt whether they were part of the eu or nato really would have made any difference ."

543,40k troops isnt 1/10th what you need to invade russia . dont worry
544,because this is media reporting and troop counts are easy for anyone to understand
545,"because troop counts are easy to objectively measure . and may be a half-decent proxy for all those other things ( some more tangible than others ), which aren't as simple to account for . it might be a least-worst proxy for a more complete measure of ' total capability ' deployed . additionally , if bullets fly ... casualties becomes the most meaningful metric , so troop counts do have that extra weight to them ."
546,"because this isnt about military power , its about commitment , also its just a more relatable metric , 40k people has more meaning to the average person than 6 divisiosn 8 battalions 1 roman legion and 2 viking warbands or whatever other arbitrary measure you choose , as for your question , i doubt they have , hell i dont think its possible at all , there just soo soo many factors and lots of randomness that its beyond impossible "" accurately measure the "" oomph """", and if it was possible it would not be public info ."
547,"> surely all those trillions nato puts into strategic studies has yielded a more accurate way to measure oomph than a centuries old vanity metric of counting human heads from the days of spears and swords ? the internal strategic views of nato are not entirely shared with the general public . i can't go into too much detail and what not , but i'll say that attaching a number to the size of a military is not that value and personally i haven't seen it matter in professional conversations , with a few exceptions like occupying/defending territory . what you are seeing from media outlets are easy to digest numbers for the general public and sent out via nato public affairs/officials . there are a lot of conversations that happen that the general public will never hear or see the results from ."
548,"why would you tell an enemy precisely what capabilities you had ( the media generally just report what they're told - and if they're happy with numbers of soldiers , then fuckity bye ). do you not think the generals in the various multi billion dollar funded militaries , with some of the best intelligence resources known to man , knows just a but more about what they're doing than some dudes chatting about soldiering on reddit ?"
549,because it represents a 10x increase from last year ? no one is comparing the raw number of troops lmao and it has quite literally never in written history been about raw numbers
550,> surely all those trillions nato puts into strategic studies has yielded a more accurate way to measure oomph than a centuries old vanity metric of counting human heads from the days of spears and swords ? it would be in the best interests of nato to conceal that measure .
551,"troop numbers isnt the whole story and no one ever said it was - literally in the history of ever . in fact military history is completely full of the opposite situation being the case . that said , troop numbers do have some meaning . 40k troops means major battle group level command hqs , it means major artillery and air support connected and , of course , it means huge logistical networks established . no modern army has 10,000 men sleeping in a field with no other assets to their name , its always about the relative organization of those troops and , as the size increases , the additional assets and support elements that get included . its never just about how many boots can march over the border ."
552,what metric would you suggest that's easy for newspapers to use and the population to understand ?
553,because it's the easiest metric to quantify with a concise number that looks good on a headline ?
554,[ euronews.com ]( never played advance wars
555,"modern warfare has more technical , resupply , and support soldiers than it has in all of history . i was watching a documentary recently that put the ratio of front line solders to support staff at 10-1 during wwii . that has since flipped and now there are 10 support staff for every one front line soldier . so to answer your question - the troops we have deployed are there for a more collaborative and complex battle strategy . that is exactly what our trillions of tax dollars has been spent on for the last many decades ."
556,like 90 % of the top comments are people cheering this on or fucking video-game references . jesus christ
557,"you are the voice of most europeans i believe ( im one too ) we dont want war , we dont want nuclear bombs , we want to live in peace like we have been , i know this is nato showing their strength to protect their members and im sure through the back doors negotiating is happening , as with a lot of these things we wont see whats been going on politically until its all over and they announce something , its too delicate at the moment to release that information to the public ."
558,you must not have stock in lockheed

560,thats a lot of bodies for a well trained military with modern equipment .
561,"cant tell if accurate , a clone wars joke , or a lucky coincidence "
562,"for those counting , russian armed forces carry 2 million in reserves . in total , their remain strength is roughly 3 million personnel ."
563,your clones . impressive they are .
564,serious question here . what about the nukes ? how does that factor in to all of this at this stage ?
565,"no , this was definetly not the reason . yes all of those thigns happened but had no effect on the troop numbers on the russian border . either because there were no troops involved or because germany , the country in question , is not on the russian border . these numbers are just from the nato efp program . in reaction to the invasion of crimea nato established battlegroups in the country named in the quote . these were intentionally kept small as to not further escalate things . increasing the numbers was a reaction to the movement of russian troops and the russian attack on ukraine . not because more troops were planned to be stationed in those places . also the us is part of the polish battlegroup ."
566,"if russia can swallow their pride then yes . the ukranians have already humiliated russia and evaporated their reputation as a premier conventional military power . victory at this point isn't uselessly dealing russia further embarrassment , it's getting them out of the country as quick as humanly possible . russia still has a good deal of tanks they are currently using and can use , and others mothballed that they could theoretically eventually deploy . destroying as many of those possible is a good tactical goal , but secondary to the goal of ending the war and cementing a ukranian strategic victory ."

582,> what of value in the modern world is to be had by invading ? none at all but russia thinks there is .
583,"probably what we've done in almost every single nation where the local government is forced to capitulate : * ensure favourable economic trade agreements are "" agreed to "", primarily in the area of raw resources * leave behind a force "" to ensure social and political stability in the region "" * and then go back to doing what we were doing before ( with the potential of phasing out the security forces ). i mean , if russia supplied europe with 41 % of its imports of natural gas alone , it means russia (** allegedly **) has plenty of resources to be extracted , hopefully in other sectors but beggars can't be choosers . that , and forced reparations because after west has put so much funds into ukraine to bolster them financially throughout all of this , there will be plenty of blame to direct towards the aggressors to rebuild ("" you break it , you bought it ""). ^( it could happen at a massive scale or even a small one , i'm not sure . i'm just sure that the above would happen if the modern world invaded . doubtful the modern world would though , because russia's neutral-allies would probably rise to the fight ....)"
584,"> what of value in the modern world is to be had by invading ? tactical positions . the us didn't want iraq because of its oil ( only ) they wanted to have a place where they could station a massive buildup of troops in the middle-east without having to negotiate or capitulate with any other country . russia doesn't want ukraine for it's natural resources ( only ) they want a larger buffer between them and europe where they can station their troops and rebuild that massive "" iron curtain "" of scary looking military might . all of this isn't because we're all preparing for the next war ( only ) it's also about having a big stick in the right place to support future interests , having command over a region , showing others that you can't be intimidated , displaying your wealth and power and hopefully investors will look at your nation like a secure investment . if you think all this is kind of a thin reason to go to war , and the motivations sound childish and wasteful . well , you're right ."
585,seems like many people have forgotten this possibility and are complacent .
586,ya ... so many people on this thread is not worried at all for some reason . they seem so sure that it won't happen . it's crazy . to have that .. confidence about something that you don't have control over .
587,"also , realistically this is only the quick reaction/high readiness force . if russia truly decided to fuck around and find out , every nato country would mobilize before putin could say cyka blyat , rush b(elgium )"
588,"russia's forces are already decimated . if nato jumped into the fray , just the american contingent on the border would be sufficient to virtually eliminate them ."
589,the irony here is that nobody would even want to invade russia . it's a shithole .

605,they turned into psychopaths during the pandemic . the scary amount of people i've seen defending a sort of nazi darwinist ideology when it comes to the weak deserving to die because of covid .
606,"oh ya , i get called a russian bot all the time simply for not agreeing 100 % with whatever media is pushing currently ."

608,"yep , i've seen lots of wwiii comments downvoted on this sub . i find it astonishing people aren't more concerned . everyone just needs to clam down"
609,you can be proud of the nato response and not want an expanded war . if nato hadnt expanded and wasnt forming a defensive perimeter on the eastern border the war would have likely spread already . the poles arent going to allow a threepeat .
610,that's the problem . russia doesn't want to take the l or to be more exact . putin

614,"also , i heard that kaliningrad has nukes because of its strategic position"
615,"you could never win . everyone would lose . if a nuclear power is being invaded , those nukes are gonna come out ."
616,"you can do most of the fighting with 250,000 troops , you need the 3.5 million to secure it after the war is over ."
617,"most of that is meant to go into logistics and support , not combat ( as the russians have learned , painfully , over the last few months )."
618,3.5 million well on the way
619,"yes .. but do they have uniforms , weapons and food for 3 million soldiers ? and what would calling them all up do to the already pretty bad russian economy ? not to mention that having 3 million not very motivated armed conscripts and reservists is a risk in itself ."
620,imagine how badly those reserves will be based on how extremely poorly their best troops operated . lambs to the slaughter .
621,the nukes are why this is a hypothetical
622,"> serious question here . what about the nukes ? how does that factor in to all of this at this stage ? the nukes are mad . once those are flying , it's all over . i'm no military strategist , but given the amount of nuclear weapons pointed at targets here and in russia , i don't see how you can make any plans beyond pressing the button and praying to whatever god you believe in ."
623,"> serious question here . what about the nukes ? how does that factor in to all of this at this stage ? well any firing of a nuclear weapon would probably result in a full nuclear exchange because you can't actually tell for sure if the first missile is the last or where it is heading . especially since russia has developed hypersonic missiles if you are the us president you have to make a decision with the information that a hypersonic missile could be on its way to new york right now . the uk has an independent deterrent so you can actually almost wait it out but the us has a lot of its nuclear weapons on the ground and they need an order to fire . pushing the button would mean the end of russia as a political entity , especially the people in charge of it . it would probably also result in a global economic collapse , and the only country left with a sizeable military would be china . putin and the western leaders know all this so the only time they'd choose to do it is if they were a ) mad or b ) this outcome was better than the alternative . for example of nato forces were going to actually invade russia , putin is done for , possibly dead . he doesn't really have much incentive to not press the button . his family are in places with bunkers as is he . on the other hand if nato throw russia out of occupied territory and then keep them in russia and don't advance ... well suddenly its not necessarily a easy choice to push that button . this is what we will likely see if ukraine really does start "" winning "". there won't be columns of ukrainian military marching into russia . at best they will retake crimea but i highly doubt it as i don't think they have the ability to undertake an amphibious or air assault required to take crimea from dug in russians . i suspect what will happen if ukraine starts winning is they will throw russia out of all their territory and then negotiate peace with russia . formally acknowledging crimea is part of russia while russia acknowledges eastern ukraine is part of ukraine ."
624,"considering how effective the javelins have been , i don't think russian tanks are much of an obstacle so long as you've got a javelin for every 10th man"
625,"it should also be noted that ukrainian military and diplomatic theorists expect that they will have to fight at least two more wars to maintain their independence , they've banked that russia will attempt this again even if they do drive them out of ukraine fully . ukraine will remain an armed camp on russias border for literally decades to come if they are unable to join the eu/nato fully as well ."
626,"to be fair it was ukrainians with western funding , weapons and intel . not downplaying the ukrainian military's efforts , without their manpower and motivation , nothing like this would be possible . but neither without the western support . zelenskiy has said so himself . this is very much a western proxy war against russia , but it seems that's what putin wants ."
627,"this is so fucked up to people who aren't heinous civ nerds , lol ."

635,may you live in interesting times .
636,the russians were a giant part..might even argue the biggest part to why the axis lost . hitler attacking them and betraying them could very possibly be the biggest military blunder of all time .
637,churchill wanted that as well . by that point those doing the fighting were done .
638,"patton wanted to commit a nuclear genocide , genocide that would have included not only russians but also a lot of other nations , including the ukrainians ."
639,"that would have necessitated nuking russia like 10x . their military machine at that point was insane . while we propagandize about our contribution to the war in europe , we fought barely a quarter of germanys army , literally the b team , and had air superiority the entire time . fighting russia would be night and day ."
640,"that's cool and all , but you are talking millions more dead to achieve that goal . can't also be assumed that even with a successful war outcome , the occupation of russia/the soviet union would have been easy . the sheer scale in both land and population would had made it extraordinarily difficult even under the best of ( realistic ) circumstances ."
641,r/shitamericanssay
642,"i mean that's why this invasion was so outrageous . the idea of empire building through aggressive invasion has been obsolete since arguably the end of the * first * world war , as by the time hitler did it it was already seen as unacceptable on the world stage ."
643,"> russia's neutral-allies would probably rise to the fight russia vs nato ? in this hypothetical scenario of large scale ground war that never goes nuclear , there's no way anyone ~~ has the spine ~~ is foolish enough to throw their lot in with a nation that will shortly cease to exist"

646,i understand 100 % why nato forces absolutely should not move in . i agree with it too . but damn if i wish they could . it would clean up this mess quick and less lives would be lost on all sides .
647,"yes .. i doubt that germany/poland/lithuania would be interested even in taking over kaliningrad . 1 million russian citizens would then be theirs , and just bringing infrastructure up to eu standard would cost billions and take years . not to mention cleaning up environmental damage in all the military bases ."
648,i want to try coolcola - release the howitzers smithers .
649,"> the irony here is that nobody would even want to invade russia . it's a shithole . speaking realistically , one of the most certain ways to prevent this from happening again is to crush the russians , then marshall plan part 2 : electric boogaloo them . the allies won ww2 , then rebuilt germany and japan as allies and fellow democracies . allowing russia to fester isn't going to solve this"

659,"alright i think it's time to broach the subject : is there any solution to this ? also how do we know that the company in charge of this website isn't tampering with/rigging votes ? could a "" decentralized "" meta-forum like this ever hope to be resistant to bot-nets ?"
660,"nah . do you know how many times i've been called a russian bot just for being a little critical of the pro-anything-us agenda ? hint : it's nowhere close to 0 americans in particular took this russian bots thing as a getaway to dismiss the slightest opinion that doesn't follow theirs . it's pathetic really . and if russian bot doesn't fit then trumptard will . i'm mexican ffs . but that doesn't stop anybody . as it stands right now , there's 2,200 some comments in this comment section alone . let's say 60 % are by unique users . i really don't think a huge percentage of 1,200 accounts are bots trying to deceive you . and if they do then that's on you ."
661,happy final cake day !
662,i don't think a quarter million men would be necessary to make the russian military collapse . ukraine made their short comings painfully obvious .
663,"unless it goes nuclear , in which case the ground will be held by cockroaches ."
664,you must be very proud .
665,"motivation would increase enormously if it was their homes that were being invaded , and the economy would collapse overnight in such a case but growth , savings and prospects would be meaningless when existence is threatened . but in terms of equiptment i doubt they'd have much equiptment ready to use from storage . they'd probably have to repair a lot of unmaintained equiptment and then there is the question of how much of their storage actually exists"
666,"everyone seems to think that 3 million personnel equals 3 million front line soldier , which is certainly not . you need the majority of those men to be in _support_ roles ."
667,the us got rid of the draft after vietnam for a reason .
668,also gotta pray that nobody involved in any step of the process stops it by refusing the command .
669,they only have to cut off the water and keep sinking battleships with there missles . it will become pretty hard to stay on crimea then .
670,it is an established meme for years and years on reddit that gandhi likes to nuke nations . even for non civ players ( me ).
671,the memes so well known now though
672,"wish everyone could be a civ nerd , one of the greatest games ever !"
673,that message only comes up after theyve already denounced you & one of your allies .
674,attacking genghis khans trade caravan then shaving his ambassadors beard when he demanded punishment might be higher on the list .
675,"stalin hated hitler . if barbarossa didn't happen the reverse would have a few years later when the soviets were better prepared . zero chance stalin would have tolerated the nazis taking all of europe on his doorstep . really hitler's only chance of long term victory was to hit russia before they could fully mobilize . it almost worked , if not for that meddling lend lease act ."
676,"it wasn't really a betrayal , molotov-ribbentrop was always a delay to the start of war rather than a real non-aggression pact . the soviet union needed time to mobilize and the nazis wanted to bulldoze their way through western europe before turning towards what they knew was the bigger fight . the nazis hated communists and they hated slavs and the soviets were both . the plan was always to wage a genocidal war against them and resettle the land with the master race . everybody on both sides knew that the fight was going to happen ."
677,"i think it's a bit disingenuous to say "" the russians "", when it was the ussr back then . you're giving way too much credit to russia and not enough to the other republics . russia lost 14m of the 27m dead soviets , which means the other half weren't russian"
678,"this idea is pushed a lot by russian propagandists , but not very true . they were definitely a necessary part in winning but not the "" biggest "". russia was severely losing the war until it's western allies started to take north africa back from the axis and reduced the naval threats in north atlantic and mediterranean , which opened up the possibility of invasions into southern france , italy , greece , etc . germans started withdrawing their positions in russia in late 1942 and early 1943 because of this , which gave russia the opportunity to turn the tide on their fronts . for comparison , operation torch ( allied invasions of north africa ) began on november 8th , 1942 and operation uranus ( russian counterattack around stalingrad ) begin on november 20th , 1943 . the only reason the russians did so well is because hitler forced the army to do some stupid things ( read up on operation uranus sometime and hitler's insistence on trying to keep the city at all costs ). in fact , the biggest reason the axis lost could be easily argued to be hitler himself . his decisions in half a dozen important moments during the war against advice of military leadership caused massive problems that gave a severe advantaged to the allies many times . but the war was won by a massive coordinated effort agreed upon milestones from each side . russians wanted western allies to open up other fronts to distract and weaken the germans , and each time they did so the russians made gains from it and vice versa . edit : corrected operation torch year , per demon-entrails ."
679,"i think you might be confusing patton with macarthur . macarthur wanted the us to essentially carpet bomb korea with nukes to win the korean war . i dont think patton would have wanted that in 1945 since the american nuclear arsenal was still very limited . also the russians didnt have nukes until 1948 i think it was , so the americans wouldve been the only ones dropping nukes for at least three years ."
680,"who do you think fueled the russian army ? the us supplied russia , russia provided bodies no doubt , but not the jeeps that took those troops anywhere"
681,"you should have stuck with * second * world war . inarguably , aggressive invasion was relevant during ww2 . hitler didn't care what the world stage thought was unacceptable ."
682,"this aint about making russia get fucked , if nato ever was to pose a direct threat to russia , putin knows hes beat . nato would dominate russia , everyone including putin knows that . its not very hard to infer from putins own speeches that if a nato vs russia conflict was to happen , he wouldnt hesitate to launch their nuclear arsenal . the purpose of this conflict should not be stick it to russia . this isnt the type of conflict that would have a winner ."
683,but japan's military is only a self defence force ?
684,"it will take 30-50 years to fix this , minimum . they already had an aging population with low birth rate before all this . putin sped it up . even if things smoothed over in the next year or two and russians started having babies again , which is unlikely , thats two decades before they see any impact of a new workforce ."
685,want some real pedantics ? look up the etymological fallacy .
686,arguably more lives would be lost if nato advanced . specifically everyone's lives
687,"i wouldn't underestimate invading russia ... this is a lesson history has already taught us a few times . russia is huge , much bigger then iraq or afghanistan . and would be much harder to subdue . sure nato would go in and "" win "" in a few months ... but we would also still be there 20 years from now ."
688,"you don't undo thousands of years of russian history and just install democracy there . the ussr fell but we got putin . and before the ussr was a bunch of garbage too . their history is compromised of despots and dictators , and no amount of money will change it . it's so engrained in their culture it isn't funny ."
689,"> then rebuilt germany and japan as allies as hedges against the ussr and china , you mean . also we intervened in russia in 1990 , it resulted in life expectancy dropping by ten years as the former ussr was strip-mined for assets and then the scraps were divvied up by oligarchs ."
690,also the fun time that is the age of strife ...
691,tens of millennia
692,"scary to think of the "" dead internet theory "", basically everyone you talk to , including me is a bot except the few you know in person . imagine if 95 % of comments you see are in fact ai .. question is : could you even tell ? i dont think there is a solution except maybe creating a new "" version "" of the internet that connects every user to a sent in verification process of passport etc . but thats not gonna happen lol"
693,what people forget is that america also operates bots to push its agenda .
694,"russia's military has clearly shown itself to be far less capable than previously theorized . but . there's a big difference between a confused invasion into another country , and defending your own country . i wouldn't presume russia's performance in ukraine would be replicated if they were defending russia , on russian soil . it might be mind you , but i wouldn't plan on it . indeed that's seemingly the fatal mistake putin made , under-estimating his opponent . ( hell that's the problem hitler made as well , under similar circumstances where the ussr performed extremely poorly in the winter war against finland )"
695,"3.5 million is probably the correct amount . you dont use enough troops , armor , and munitions to bring a war to conclusion . you also do not fight the military on the other side alone . to bring a war to conclusion you use 10 soldiers for every 1 the enemy brings to the fight . you use ten tanks , ten aircraft , ten bullets , etc . you go into their supply lines and kill everyone that doesnt immediately surrender . you level any depot or building that could possibly be supporting the war effort . you dont fight them directly you level their camps and bases at night when they are sleeping or unaware . you spare the soldiers as much as you can , but if theyre headed to an aircraft you eliminate them . you dont win a war and you make it as much as an unfair fight as possible to the point that they give up because their tank will get destroyed by a weapon fired from hundreds of miles away . you bring it to completion and wholly take over the nation . you dissolve the government and institute the laws and institutions of your side . you allow the people to vote , but disallow anyone that was a part of the regime from running for election . you keep an overwhelming amount of troops in the nation til you can be sure that they wont rise again against your side . thats why no one has won a war since wwii ."
696,this army is for the republic .
697,i dont think anyone is seriously considering invading russia so i dont see how their motivation would increase ..
698,im just going to assume that some enterprising mid level officers helped themselves to a good part of the funds that were supposed to go to maintaining equipment and stocks .
699,that would never happen because nato is a ** defensive ** alliance . nato doesnt invade .
700,"oh sure , but you still have to clothe and feed them . and every hour they spend working for the armed forces is an hour that they cant work their civilian job ."
701,actually you have to pray everyone refuses the command because if they actually fly human life on earth is essentially over . they say the only way to win this game is to not play for a reason .
702,"they don't need battleships to hold crimea and getting water to hard to reach places is not that difficult , we do it in africa constantly . the problem is governments aren't spending that much on helping african countries and the countries themselves often ha egovernments siphoning off aid money . in crimea russia can fly in water supplies or have them shipped in via civilian ships ( which would be a war crime to destroy ). they can then set up desalination plants to have drinkable but gross tasting water . they only need to survive on shipped in water long enough to set up infrastructure in crimea . also fairly sure making civilians die of thirst by cutting off water supplies would be ukraine committing a war crime"
703,not really . it's decades old tech against modern tech .
704,only when hes feeling extra peaceful .
705,"not sure about that one . to be honest , 99 % of younger generation know close to nothing about him except him killing own son and being somewhat deranged ."
706,the guy who did that was apparently executed by having molten silver poured into his eyes and ears . thats gotta leave a mark .
707,yeah that is a legend that will echo through history
708,so thats where gameworkshop took their lore for the war between dwarfs and elves in warhammer : o
709,then when genghis khan's army finally caught this guy they killed him by pouring molten silver in his eyes and mouth .
710,you also have to consider oil reserves . a big reason hitler chose to move against russia is because the western front would have exhausted germany's oil reserves in ~ 2 years had he not taken russian oil fields .
711,"german loss in 1941 aka barbarossa can be directly attributed to disagreements on what the main effort was ; moscow or destroying the red army in the field . not saying they would have won if that didn't happen , but its the strategic reason ."
712,at that point it would be isolated to the eastern front . you wouldn't have to divide so many resources so far apart like they did during their downfall . had they just focused on the west i don't know if the western front would breakthrough..especially considering the losses they had at much weaker capacity .
713,had hitler not went to war at all or settled for peace after france its likely they would have developed the nuclear bomb before the ussr was ready to attack in the first place .
714,> stalin hated hitler . if barbarossa didn't happen the reverse would have a few years later when the soviets were better prepared . zero chance stalin would have tolerated the nazis taking all of europe on his doorstep . there is zero proof that stalin was going to betray hitler or even attack germany in any capacity . perhaps that isn't the case in another timeline but in our own version of history this wasn't even up for debate until the 80s and it originated from a man who claimed that stalin used hitler as a proxy to attack europe .
715,"that's fair , i think russia is a simplified form for people who may not know what the ussr was and who was part of it ."
716,"> operation torch ( allied invasions of north africa ) began on november 8th , 1943 operation torch was 42 not 43 > in fact , the biggest reason the axis lost could be easily argued to be hitler himself . i dont think this is an academic position . reads more like hastings or some wehraboo propaganda"
717,"> the only reason the russians did so well is because hitler forced the army to do some stupid things ( read up on operation uranus sometime and hitler's insistence on trying to keep the city at all costs ). this is a line straight from the post-war memoirs and autobiographies of the nazis who were allowed to help write the history of the war . franz halder in particular notoriously blamed every failure on either hitler or nazi officers who weren't in a position to defend themselves on account of either being dead or in spandau . the simple fact was that the german high command was incompetent . they built a machine that was very effective in a particular type of warfare , and which worked very well in * very specific circumstances ,* and then took that machine into a new environment and expected it to perform equally well in an entirely different kind of war . the simple fact is this : the moment it became clear that the war against the ussr was a war of extermination , germany lost . if they had been willing to content themselves with poland or even perhaps the brest-litovsk territories , they might have won , at least short term . however , in a war of attrition germany was never going to defeat the ussr . they simply did not have the stockpiles , the manpower or the logistical capacity . german defeat was inevitable . it likely would have taken a very long time , and no doubt would have left the soviet union even more devastated than it was , but it was inevitable ."
718,> russia was severely losing the war until it's western allies started to take north africa sorry but that is just a massive lie and you should not repeat it north africa was a battle to take small cities and with small armies russian front 1.5 million germans and 3 million soviets with massive cities raced to the ground...please don't repeat such nonsense ...
719,"the soviets proved they could stand against the germans alone at the battle of moscow in ' 41 . the fact that case blue was limited to a single army group and not a front-wide offensive like barbarossa speaks to how whittled down the german army was afterwards . the number of german divisions in africa never got above single digits , on the eastern front it was never less than triple digits . north africa was important but it wasn't critical to soviet success . also , the idea that the german army failed because it made mistakes is literally every army in history . ' if they were better they would have won the war ' isn't a particularly insightful analysis ."
720,"considering the vast majority german soldiers killed died on the eastern front , i'm not sure i can call it russian propaganda ."
721,"american steel , british intelligence , russian blood"
722,"i really doubt germany ever could have won against the ussr . they totally caught the red army by surprise , pushed them all the way back to moscow , and they had to fall back . obviously the soviets were helped a ton by lend lease and military aid , but i can't imagine the nazis actually winning , at best they probably would have just kept the line on the dnieper ."
723,"i think people are maybe confusing patton with churchill not macarthur . churchill didn't directly suggest that the americans should nuke the soviets but he did state that "" america knows that fifty-two per cent of russias motor industry is in moscow and could be wiped out by a single bomb . it might mean wiping out three million people , but they would think nothing of that.they think more of erasing an historical building like the kremlin "". he also told the canadian prime minister at the time "" the west should make it clear that the soviet union must not extend its regime any further in western europe , churchill argued . he added that if the soviets did not accept the ultimatum , a western leader should tell them straight we will attack moscow and your other cities and destroy them with atomic bombs from the air. "" these were likely just threats though as churchill never made any bombing proposals to the us state department or president truman and in 1948 he reassessed his thoughts to parliament when he stated that the best way to prevent war with the soviet union was "" to bring matters to a head with the soviet governmentto arrive at a lasting settlement ."""
724,"russias internal rail lines wouldve been operating at full war capacity by the end of wwii , not to mention we also wouldve started another two front war , because we werent done with japan yet . a whole lot of people in this thread wouldnt exist if we started a full scale war with the soviet union after wwii , and while russia is still annoying today , id still rather not gamble great grandpa dying to prevent it . not saying the us would lose , just that we didnt even have nukes immediately after beating japan ."
725,"arguably , if hitler managed to pacify central europe and repel the uk , he'd probably keep it all ."
726,"in order to not have to change the constitution , they reinterpreted it and now they are allowed to defend their allies . so if russia attacks in the west , i guess they could defend them by distracting russia on some islands ."
727,it counts as self defense if the kurils are japanese
728,it's self defense if a japanese general decides to go on holiday in russia and brings a few military divisions as body guards .
729,"technically , since no peace treaty was ever signed between russia/su and japan , japan could shoot russians any minute because since wwii every day is a war day and with russians stationed on the kurils a japanese self defence case against russia is a given ."
730,and the brain drain as well as the incoming malnutrition and lack of social welfare to ensure the children are brought up in productive manner .
731,we're lazy . pedantically proceed please .
732,thats what im saying .
733,not a russian invasion . cleaning things up to the pre-2014 ukrainian border
734,"the ussr was in massive trouble by 1990 with or without intervention though . stagnating economy , lots of corruption and defeat in afghanistan . even if the ussr had somehow not dissolved , something would have happened ."
735,we do get to ride a dark age of technology tho .
736,no ones trying to invade russia .
737,"yes , "" home advantage "" is a thing ... but what russia has shown in ukraine , are some severe defficiencies in intelligence , logistics , technology , troop training , and discipline over the whole chain of command . pretty much the only thing they've done somewhat well , is propaganda . which in an external attack scenario , would only lead to a suicidal massacre . the mistake putin made , was trusting anyone in a country that's been for decades operating on an institutionalized pile of lies ."
738,"i don't entirely disagree , but ... any conventional war against russia wouldn't be fought on russian soil . it would be fought mostly * above * russian soil , and they would get obliterated ."
739,"yup . russia has way better logistics inside it's borders , mainly thanks to it's railway corps which is huge . and a big part of their failure in ukraine was failed truck logistics . edit : however as other said , no one wants to invade russia . nobody gives a shit ."
740,it's in ukraine's best interests for russia to go home immediately . it's in nato's best interests for russia to stay in ukraine and bleed out to the last conscript and ruble . if russia quits they may regroup . or some in the eu may get cold feet and lose their sense of urgency about transitioning from russian energy . nato can't follow russia into russia without heavy risk of nukes .
741,hitler left the eastern front no choice . it was either die fighting or die by the germans . some nations were glad the germans had taken over until they were taken to concentration camps .
742,you say no one has won a war since wwii but you forgot the war on drugs which was won by drugs
743,"if it's a fair fight you're doing it wrong . you fight to win . be decisive , for if you're already committed to violence you have a duty to get it over with quickly and efficiently . it saves lives in the long run ."

745,thats how i play aoe
746,"falklands war ( uk ) first gulf war ( allies ) vietnam ( viet cong / communist regime ) 6 day war ( israel ) yom kippur / ramadan / october war ( israel ) suez crisis / tripartite aggression ( egypt / coalition ). there were some very clear results of these conflicts , to say no one has won a war since ww2 is disingenuous ."
747,"> you dissolve the government and institute the laws and institutions of your side . yeah , no . don't do this unless the people hate their leader . it's very common to leave to old leaders in power , but keep them under your thumb . you want them to tell the people to stand down and not resist . it's why the allies let the emperor of japan keep his position . and part of why i thought russia plotting to assassinate zelensky was fucking stupid . taking out the leaders is just going to infuriate the people and you'll spend god knows how long dealing with terrorists and resistance fighters ."
748,r/shermanposting
749,"???? vietnam won their war , the us and their coalition won both wars against iraq ( the baath party ceased to exist ), israel won the 6 day war , britain won the falklands war ."
750,sounds like a copypasta
751,seems like the anti-iraq coalition did this during desert storm .
752,"ahh that last part of dissolving governments etc doesn't work in many places ( iraq , afghanistan etc ). if the country has a firm , robust national identity then it can , otherwise it just fractures along religious , idealogical , ethnic lines etc without oppressive overlordship ."

754,> you level any depot or building that could * possibly * be supporting the war effort . war crimes
755,this works great in video games and with non-nuclear adversaries .
756,what you're describing is the nation building philosophy professed by the neo-conservative movement of the last half century . it's caused copious amounts of destruction and chaos in its wake .
757,> thats why no one has won a war since wwii . vietnam seems to have been pretty good at it .
758,you're trying too hard
759,you said no one has won a war . does that mean theyve all been ties ?
760,iran won the iran-iraq war . israel has won a couple wars . russia/the ussr has won a couple . the us and us lead coalitions have won several . china conquered tibet . north vietnam won the vietnamese war . vietnam won the war against cambodia . the falklands war was won by the uk . many other wars have had clear victors since ww2 . to say nothing of the numerous civil wars which have come and gone since then .
761,this is some grade f cringe . touch grass .
762,social media would get real quiet
763,would not be a warcrime if a maritime exclusion zone around crimea where to be established . any ship that violates such exclusion would be fair game as they have been warned . but ukraine without a navy doesn't have the capability to establish such a exclusion zone and you can't do it with just missiles .
764,> thats gotta leave a mark . yeah but he never saw it

768,hitler got new oil deliveries from stalin all the way through the invasions of poland and france and up to a few days before hitler attacked the ussr .
769,that's why so much of the war early on took place in northern africa .
770,"the nazis never got very far in their atom bomb program and it's likely it would have taken a decade had they continued developing it at the rate they did . they considered it "" jewish science "" and largely thought it was baloney . iirc when the americans took stock of germany's postwar atomic resources they had barely developed their first atomic pile . settling for peace would have dried up their oil reserves and the allies likely never would have let it happen . iirc chamberlain was already out by the time france fell and churchill's political allies never would have let him sue for peace . combine that with the americans declaring war and peace was never a tactical or political option for hitler ."
771,"the germans never took the bomb that seriously . it was a side project , and once they lost the heavy water factory in norway they wrote it off altogether . it took the us about 22 billion ( with a b ) usd ( adjusted ) for the manhattan project . germans spent about 10 million ( with an m )."
772,"the nazis would never have developed the bomb . they considered modern physics "" jewish science "" and the german nuclear program stalled as a result . even if they "" embraced "" modern physics , there would be few if any physicists left - as most were jews and had the foresight to gtfo before they got killed"
773,"i understand , and a year ago i would've grouped the ussr and russia as the same . i just don't want to give russia credit because fuck them ."
774,"> may not know what the ussr was and who was part of it . ???? dang ... that's a crazy thought , lol , but yeah , i'm sure there are plenty people ignorant of even the most important parts of recent history ."
775,"i'm not referring to necessarily fighting russia after the war in that hypothetical , i'm referring to teh dude saying we "" propagandize about our contribution to the war in europe , we fought barely a quarter of germanys army , literally the b team , and had air superiority the entire time "" saying we fought the "" b team "" while russia fought the "" a team "" is disingenuous considering we were fueling russia with equipment . like the dude never heard of the lend lease program , which we're doing today with ukraine lmao "" it has been estimated that american deliveries to the ussr through the persian corridor alone were sufficient , by us army standards , to maintain sixty combat divisions in the line "" the russian military machine that was so insane seems to have really been outsourced from the us the whole time"

780,it prefered politically and monetary connected cadres to be prometed . now with war and quick ' natural selection ' of noncompetent cadres into fertilizer there is nonzero probability that some competent commanders will rise from rest . which is worrying .
781,and then they would have to be occupied .
782,the whole world would because if you think they won't launch a nuke in that situation idk what to tell you .
783,"if there were a conventional war against russia , it would 100 % include ground based warfare . there is simply no replacing a person physically occupying a piece of land . and that person is an infanteer . everything else , and i do mean everything , just exists to support the infantry in occupying the desired land ."
784,"i always wanted to travel on the trans siberian route . guess that will have to be several decades away now , if ever ."
785,"this is my biggest problem with this pointless war , the russian people think the west wants to invade or destroy it because of their propaganda . thing is , not once in my whole life has their been any hint or any sort of cultural or political talk of doing this . it's just not something people in the english speaking world ever talked about or even considered . russia is totally and obviously in the wrong here . i know we have geopolitics and our own propaganda here , but this situation is blindingly obvious . there's no nuance here . the west does not want to invade or destroy russia ( whatever they think ' destroy ' actually means in practical terms ). the iraq and afghanistan wars were badly handled ( and ultimately a mistake imo ), but there was at least an obvious threat from islamic terrorism as proven by 9/11 and the following attacks around the world . what russia is doing is complete madness and a symptom of them lying to themselves for so long ."
786,"i hate to be cynical , but damn it , you have a point . while i truly believe nato is doing a ton to help out ukraine , supplying an insane amount of weaponry and intelligence , and their actions show clear strong support it is true that it is in natos best tactical interest to drag the whole thing out until every russian soldier is dead , every weapon russia has is used up and destroyed . and if that means more ukrainians die as it takes months or years to accomplish , well , the world will be a safer place in the end . thats a really sad calculation ."

802,"dont know why its getting upvoted , seems like armchair general nonsense . many wars have been fought since ww2 , and many had clear winners and losers . the idea that a war can only be won through total occupation of one party by another is absurd . algeria didn't occupy france during the algerian independence war or topple its "" regime "" ( though france proceeded to do the latter to herself )."

805,i thought drogo was made into a vegetable by a curse and then suffocated by emilia clarke ? her dick of an elder brother got the golden crown .

813,"other guy in the comments is right about the fact that these shipments weren't enough . i also want to add that germany and the ussr were major geopolitical rivals . on top of this , one of the core ideas behind fascism is the destruction of communism . hitler hated stalin , stalin hated hitler . even if stalin had given hitler enough oil , war was bound to happen ."
814,"i grew up in the last decade of the cold war - i often accidentally use russia/soviet/ussr interchangeably , even though i know theres a huge difference . what i've found the last 6 months is - _a lot_ of things i assumed ' russia ' had accomplished was actually ukraine ."

817,barren wasteland that boasts a significant portion of the world's agriculture .
818,"it's a barren and corrupt wasteland but it has more natural resources than most other countries . its too bad the oligarchs control all those valuable resources russia is just extremely inefficient at getting or tapping into these various resources , transporting/shipping them to be processed or refined , and getting them to market ( domestically and internationally ) for sale . the country is just too big and too spread out and the lack of various infrastructure is a major detriment to the big industry sector and their economy ."
819,texas has a bigger economy than russia
820,"its not about wanting russia , its about not wanting the kremlin . i wouldnt support a war to annex russia , but i would support a war to puppet it western post-ww2 style and make sure it stops fucking around with us . the russian interferences on the western politics have already done immense damage to our democracies , not to mention the environment . an operation to topple that government of moustache twirling supervillains is something id get 100 % behind ."
821,"a wasteland with tones of resources . nobody wants russia , but everybody is pumping what russia has , unfortunately ."
822,i understand that the idea is to shit on russia but they're some of the biggest natural resource producers across the board . that said nobody wants to have a full out war with a country with nukes in our day and age anyway .
823,"yay . a country with an abundance of violence and soon to be antiquated energy sources that would take millions of soldiers to occupy./s not only does no one want russia , no one even thinks about russia ."
824,like invading wyoming . lmfao
825,"but the ' natural selection ' you speak of is actively stymied from the top . putin does not trust his generals , and his generals do not trust their subordinates all the way on down . this lack of trust isn't just an attitude , it also means that no one is allowed to make decisions for themselves , they can only follow orders from above . this is * incredibly * different from the u.s . military . the us uses a "" pull "" system . of course people still have to follow orders , but a soldier in the field can say "" things went bad and we're changing the plan . i need an airdrop of x material at y coordinates "" and they will get it , as long as it's within reason . in the russian military they use a "" push "" system . the commanders say "" here are your supplies and your plan of attack . we have determined that this is exactly what you should do . do not deviate from this plan whatsoever ."" then things go bad , and the soldiers desert or die because no one trusts them to improvise and adapt . this doesn't breed leaders , it breeds yes men . and it's exactly why they are losing right now ."
826,"i imagine that there are some number of people with a natural ability to be good at strategy , tactics , and logistics that could rise , but it seems like it's far more likely that the people that rise to the top are trained and taught those things as they rise . and if there's no more top to train those people that are getting promoted , or those that are training them are not particularly good at the skills mentioned it doesn't seem likely that very many competent commanders will result ."
827,"that's why i was careful to say "" conventional "" war . elsewhere i have pointed out that russia is in zero danger of being invaded , because obviously nukes ."
828,"that's why he specified "" conventional war ."" when talking about hypotheticals of who would defeat who , conventional war vs . use of nukes are two completely different conversations . it's safe to assume everyone here knows about russia's nukes and mad ."
829,"a bit of irony involved too . the weapons given to ukraine in order to facilitate the destruction of russias military is being used for exactly the purpose they were bought for in the first place . from a military economic pov , these nations are getting an incredibly good roi by not risking their own soldiers ."
830,"while it may , possibly , be in natos interest to draw things out , its absolutely not for each of the member countries . nearly every economy in the world is feeling pain from this war , and its only going to get worse with each passing day . nato member countries would gladly have this war over tomorrow if they could ."

841,578 votes and counting . 
842,usually one of the two parties in a war meets the main objectives for which the war was started . but looking back at the cost of a war it is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that it should have solved everything that is wrong with a country to justify the cost of fighting them . no war is officially started to transform the losing side into a stable first world liberal democracy . saddam was toppled . no wmd found . osama is dead . the genocidal violence in bosnia and kosovo stopped . etc . etc . etc . lots of war objectives are met .

875,ukraine was part of the soviet union before the collapse and they want it back .
876,"ukrainian here . ukraine was one part of the soviet union and an absolute breadbasket because of their fantastic soil and wheat production . then holodomor happened and a bunch of other shitty things so ukraine eventually gained its independence . i use that term loosely because russia/the soviet union has continually tried to manipulate and overthrow the country to take back "" it's land ""."
877,putin has a small cock
878,"simple version , ukraine decided they wanted to pursue membership in nato and to potentially join the eu . when the president at the time ignited the desire of the people , a mass protest broke out which turned into a revolution . putin threw a temper tantrum and stole crimea and invaded the eastern part of ukraine to prevent ukraine joining nato ."
879,putin wants ukraine to be russian . fully . and the idea of having an american ally so close isnt good neither .
880,do i love my neighbour ? no .
881,"the ukraine was known as the soviet union's breadbasket because its rich , fertile soil meant that it produced tons of wheat for the country . putin is being greedy and wants that land for russia ."
882,because kiev used to be the most powerful russian state so the russians still see ukraine as part of their country
883,unchecked nationalism in the russian government .
884,"putin and zelensky are pissed , each thinking the other one spells their shared first name incorrectly ."
885,ukraine got the last doughnut

888,"i'm assuming the reason is because it's another option to chicken , duck , fish etc ."
889,what is the potential fall out of russia invading ukraine ? since it seems lots of countries are sending munitions to ukraine for a up coming war .
890,a lot of countries were part of the soviet block . but why specifically ukraine ?
891,"russia , "" the 80s were awesome !"" the rest of the world after the collapse of the u.s.s.r . "" fuck yeah ! democracy !"" fas forward to the present . russia , "" let's get back with that """
892,that's kinda fucked .
893,stalin tried starving them all to death in the 30s
894,as if russia doesn't have enough
895,what does ukraine have that russia doesn't ?
896,"ukrainian born here ! our land is very , very fertile . we are known as the bread basket of europe . although russia is a big country , not much of their land is arable because of tundra regions , mountains , etc . taking over ukraine would make russia in control of their agriculture which in turn would make them money . western ukraine has become much more modernized and democratic , even more so than russia which they may see as a threat ( cant speak of eastern ukraine as i dont have family there )."
897,world war iii . russia invading ukraine will drag both sets of military alliances into direct conflict .
898,ukraine has [ black sea ports ]( and ukraine is tipping their hand that they want to join nato . russia will not allow nato to approach closer to their borders .
899,an area known as novorossiya was part of russia for quite a long time . it has a lot more russian influence and stuff . also they're still salty about the whole crimea thing .
900,"because ukraine is weak , cannot defend itself , and ( no offense ) not really seen by the rest of europe as an "" important "" country like say , romania or hungary is . also because most of the former soviet bloc countries are now in nato or closely aligned with it while ukraine is not . if europe was a park then ukraine is all the way at the back of the park in the area that nobody goes to because the grass is overgrown with weeds . russia knows europe doesn't care enough to risk war by trying to stop them ."
901,"it's a mess and it breaks my heart . we still have family there ( my one baba gets postcards/letters ) and they're thankfully safe . russia has always had an issue with ukraine being independent , shocker i know . it's why many ukrainian or even polish people are wildly offended when someone says they're russian . all those are slavic yes , but very different culturally ."
902,russia has a long history of dominating ukraine . read up on the history .
903,the ukraine
904,i hope you and your family stay safe
905,why are they sending hundreds millions of dollars in military munitions there ?
906,"dang ! that's brutal . i wish the best for you and your family . i just asked a question and did not expect to be fully engaged . a majority of my life in america , war was just a thing . generations of my family , and for a brief second , i was part of the military . but america's neighbors are canada and mexico . europe is a whole beast on its own . so a lot of what goes on over there is difficult for me to understand . thanks for putting a human perspective on it ."
907,"that's the ukrainian spelling . it's also pronounced more like keev ( one syllable , and not the russian influenced two syllable kee-yev ). though keev is still not exactly right , but it's closer ."
908,thats the correct spelling ( versus the historic english phonetic kiev 
909,"there's a big difference between sending munitions to a country and actually going to war against a formidable country like russia . the us was sending money and guns to rebels in syria for years and when putin sent his soldiers in to back assad , we didn't do shit to stop it , just like we won't do shit to help ukraine . if you watched bidens press conference today you also would have heard him basically say we won't attack russia if they invade ukraine ."
910,"kiev is a russian way to spell it , kyiv is a ukrainian way . so when you talk about russia vs . ukraine , it's kinda political question how you spell the capital city - the russian way or ukrainian ."
911,more nasams please . i don't know if the us can do more . what i do know is that the image of a dead little girl crushed by russian cruise missile debris will be forever seared into my memory .
912,the us really wants russia to lose this war
913,he looks really different . war truly changes people
914,"and now , more missile deterrence added to ukraine's defense : glory to the heroes ."
915,that missile system is absolute bonkers !! i'm not sure where they will deploy it but it sounds like once it's deployed very few flying objects will get away from it and it's very hard to destroy
916,the russian people have the power to end this . is putin's war worth their son's and father's lives ?
917,get as much done as possible before midterms . lord knows what psychos will be in the us government by then
918,"as with everything sent to ukraine , i hope nasams ultimately saves ukrainian lives ."
919,good hunting . 
920,"us citizen here , i am glad to give of our weapons , we understand this fight is bigger than ukraine . this aggression will not stand , man ."
921,boiling the frog . a little more powerful stuff each time so putin can't escalate .
922,this is the real deal . medium-range state of the art sams . [ nasams system .](
923,"i want russia to lose , but more than anything i want ukraine to win . they've fought for centuries to have freedom , they have spent so much blood , lost so much life . god they deserve their freedom ."
924,this is great ! ukraine desperately needs cruise missile defense and these things look effective
925,we are especially grateful to ukraine for holding russia back and president zelensky for showing us what a leader can be 
926,the world has to stop enriching the terrorist state of russia ! stop buying natural resources stolen by putin from the people of russia ! stop financing the murder and rape of ukrainian kids !!

983,is it bidens money . its the american tax payers .
984,there is a limit on how many nasams there are available here(norway )
985,"nasams aren't really a system that the us uses . we use some to defend washington dc as a redundant layer of security , but thats it . i'm not sure where these 2 systems came from . but i believe they came straight off the production line . if so we will likely see more as more get built ."
986,"that is every day in ukraine , i am in this country . the image of the little girl became famous , but that is a daily reality for a lot of people here . thank you to all those who care about this place and want it to survive ."
987,"we could do more . i think we will , the nature of arming a nation is that its done over time , not all at once . several countries have these systems , but they dont have very many of them .. but they could be convinced to send 1/2 variants in exchange for 3 variants . but ya know , takes time . they really need these in kyiv , theyre excellent at taking down cruise missiles . hopefully over time we can get some in odessa and lviv at the very least ."

989,russia is a terrorist state now . they just be prevented from being able to wage war on any more innocent people .

991,"i hold an unpopular opinion on here that usa/britain/baltics/poland is playing to win , while some western european countries give just enough for ukraine to not be over run but eventually settle for a crappy peace ."
992,"regardless of involvement , i can't imagine a democratic nation that doesn't ."
993,"well , it makes sense , since the us has been hyper fixated on russia for the past almost 80 years , and over half of all of our military development has been made solely to counter russia . so now that not only is russia in a war that they started , but is committing * every * crime against humanity on a daily basis , then not only does this make the us really want to put all of our anti-russia weaponry to use , but significantly motivates us to go all in with support for ukraine since we're supporting the objective * good * guys and * being * on the good side while destroying russia !"
994,hell yes we want to see this murdering senseless empire of shame go down in a hail of our bullets !! ukraine deserves a forever home to be ukrainian and not be told how to live and what to value . slava ukraini !!

996,im an american with direct ancestry with ukraine . my dad is second generation american . my grandma was born in the us after my great grandparents fled the gulags of russia . have you heard of american tale ? thats my great grandparents . my parents and grandparents visited ukraine when i was young . my dad is horrified and unable to reach people he knew . its important to many .
997,we all want russia to really lose this war .
998,i want russia to lose this war . i want them to crumble . i want every shithead fascist out there to see putins head on a pike and realize the world has had enough of their bullshit . then i want a new renaissance for ukraine . i want them to prosper . i want their children to thrive and have joyful lives . i want them to build beautiful monuments to honor the courage of their people . and years from now i want to vacation in kiev and toast the people of ukraine .
999,"yup ! im an american , im old enough to have grown up in the 80s and 90s knowing that russia is our main enemy ! after what weve seen russia doing in ukraine , i want to see them destroyed ! how dare they do this to any other people , straight up genocide ! i want to see russian punished at all costs , including american boots on the ground , and yes , i will absolutely enlist , because they have to be stopped for the sake of our kids and grandchildren"
1000,probably the best roi we could ever expect .
1001,if russia takes control of ukraine do you think they will stop there ..?
1002,"while losing as much material as possible . it's completely understandable ... edit : russians losing as much material as possible , if that wasn't clear ..."
1003,its basically a proxy war being faught through ukraine now . this is literally the us`s wet dream to handle russia .
1004,"weve been blue balled since 1950 , we really wanna fuck with russia"
1005,"yes . also , i want ukraine to win . i couldn't tell you which one i want more ."
1006,"im not american but i want not only that they lose badly , but also repay for all the rising costs becaus eof their stupid war . also it would weaken their influence on balkan and maybe certain nation will reconsider their position on europe"
1007,it is not enough that russia should lose . ukraine should thrive . much love from the usa
1008,"the russians rape teenagers and call it military training . those soldiers have raped ukrainian women since the start of the war . they shelled a train station packed with fleeing civilians , they blew up a mall , they shelled a zoo . they tied a child to its dead mother with an anti tank mine between them to kill the rescuers . according to russia they've captured 95,000 ukrainian civilians and transported them to russia . the children have been separated from their families . they have stolen grain and farmland many other nations rely on causing famine arround the world . fuck putin , fuck gerasimov and fuck the russian military industrial complex !"
1009,"america and europe both need russia to lose this war . putin will get something so that he can claim a victory , but obviously he needs to be stopped ."
1010,"karma is a bitch and the shit they've caused over the years in terms of political interference ( trump winning 2016 ), the invasions of crimea , the general bullshit and now the higher prices in europe because of their malicious bullshit absolutely requires putin to get fucked on a scale that he has long overdue coming for him . everyones had enough of this shit and the price for putins vainglorious idiocy will be the ruination of his military , maybe even the break up of the russian federation . instigate stupid wars , win stupid defeats ."
1011,the us military industrial complex is also loving this . amazing testing for new weapon systems and great for business
1012,"sure do . all things considered this is a pretty cheap way to see russia decimated militarily and economically from the perspective of the us . unfortunately a lot of ukrainians have and will suffer/die , but that would almost certainly be worse without us involvement - not better . contrary to popular opinion , war is rarely black and white ( like wwii ). it's usually shades of gray , with right and wrong being a matter of perspective . this war in ukraine is a pretty black and white affair , which makes us action very easy to sell politically . add those things together - low us cost for the outcome plus an easy political sell - and you're going to see the arsenal of democracy opened right up in ukraine ."
1013,if russia falls the propaganda farms that have largely turned our nation into a shithole will be gone . its not entirely their fault but it's a step to stop the massive misinformation campaigns .
1014,"hell ya . what russia is doing is wrong . it's not the 1st time they've done it , it won't be the last . it has to end . it seems ukraine has been chosen by fate to be the world's champion against russian fascism . they need to be supported ."
1015,americans have been born and bred to hate russia for roughly 100 years .
1016,"yeah , i get that feeling too . its this strange feeling in the back of my head that us is not pro russia ."
1017,the world wants russia to lose this war . my grandma wants russia to lose this war . my parents wants russia to lose this war . the _only_ reason why the west haven't done to russia what we did to isis and serbia is nukes . outside of isis ( who was never much of a threat ) there hasn't been a war so justified since 1945 .
1018,"yup , that's why they finally share anti air five months after the war started . at least nobody is complaining that it's impossible to train people to use those systems or to supply them with whatever they need , or whatever they complained like in march when we actually needed antiair ."
1019,which mental stable person wouldn't want russia to lose the war ?
1020,"it's crazy . watching some of his old comedian days ' videos , he seems to be a different person ."
1021,he is my hero !!
1022,its just his beard .
1023,he looks tired
1024,> war truly changes people its the people on the front lines facing death everyday that it really changes . but obviously he is also undergoing a lot of stress and sleep deprivation
1025,high-speed anti-radiation missiles rock .
1026,only issue is the range . kyiv and odessa are the obvious places but maybe there are better intercept locations based on the direction of most cruise missiles
1027,"sadly complacency with tyranny is too ingrained in russian culture . way too many of them are too used to just accepting tyranny and living with it than actually fighting and risking making their already crappy lives worse . there's a reason though most of the anti war protestors were millennial age though , since they came of age during the one time russia attempted to open up to the west , and thus they personally are less inclined to just accept tyranny ."
1028,russian people fully support this war .
1029,"personally i think the republicans will double-down . losing a war doesn't play well with the traditional conservative republican voting base , especially one against the old commie enemy ."
1030,sadly that concerns me as well .
1031,"biden is cic of us military through 2024 and a solid majority of the gop are the classic defense hawks who strongly support aid to ukraine , as do both republican congressional leaders . they will pass aid bills even if the gop takes the house and senate ."
1032,why is it so guaranteed the republicans will do well ?
1033,"doesn't matter . republicans want full blown invasion , boots on the ground . either they're going to goad biden into it so they can blame him , or they're going to do it under the guise of cleaning up biden's mess . keep in mind , we're all psychos . the only difference is the smell ."
1034,"any and everything that takes down even 1 russian missile , aircraft , vehicle , or even soldier * will * save ukrainian lives ."
1035,hopefully these are the lastest generation of the nadams that have the longer range missiles as well as the ability to launch sidewinders are close in support .
1036,"> we understand this fight is bigger than ukraine . and even if it wasn't , ukraine would be enough ."
1037,"also american , and this fight is indeed much bigger than just ukraine , it's actually about all of humanity ."
1038,it's more about the missiles it fires than the system itself . amraams are pretty insane from a capability standpoint .
1039,"i want both pretty much just as much . i want ukraine to win because of what you said ( and i'm regretful that i didn't know enough about it and how cool of a country it is until this year ), and i want russia to lose because then the biggest threat to the world and humanity will finally be demolished ( and hopefully maybe us military spending will go down )."
1040,ironically russia is doing more than eu wanted
1041,"i haven't watched his speeches in a long while , but today i was reminded what a charismatic leader he is . there's something about the way he speaks , calmly giving the facts with just enough emotion in his voice and then the fist at the end . pretty powerful . i hope putin goes down and there's peace in ukraine again !"
1042,i do too .
1043,i lean right ( pointing out my bias ) and before the invasion i was one of the people who thought nato ( if not obsolete ) needed other countries to help take the burden . to be fair ( r ) leaders wanted other countries to up their contribution to nato not simply just leave it to leave it . after the invasion i want the us to put as much money and material aid as we did each day during the 20 year wars in iraq and afghanistan . we did it for 20 years straight with it all being a waste at least this time it will make a difference and be worthwhile . it is a joke to see people that were for the 2 wars in the past all of a sudden say we should stay out of this war ... yes once i learned more about the wars ( around hs age then currently late 20s ) i was against the invasion of iraq and any occupation campaign in afghanistan .
1044,"the maga side of the republican party , the one that has got all conservatives by the cajones would very much like to take that miniscule drop in the bucket we provide to ukraine as defense and humanitarian aide and give it away to corporations as further tax breaks . there will always be traditional conservatives in the senate who remain very interested in actual national security which of course includes nato and keeping russia in check , however they will do very little in that regards if the political calculus suggests that speaking out against an opinion held by the base would cost them political power . so with regards to forgetting about what the previous administration did , there are very few in either the house or senate that would even admit those are the facts ."
1045,"i don't blame you . he's perfect husband , father , and leader material . he is the definition of positive masculinity ."
1046,i want to vote for him .
1047,"my man needs a spa day , and statues to his balls ."
1048,iron dome is more for people sneaking close to/inside a city and firing mortars . nasam is designed to attacks from far away
1049,"i wish europeans in other subs would rethink their stance more , but nonetheless , i appreciate you for yours :) most people seem to think "" america bad !"" so it's a nice break to see someone who doesn't think that .. thank you"
1050,"europe has no good reason to hate the us , south asia , the middle east , north africa , and south america on the other hand ..."
1051,"equally possible is that they go all "" end times "" and goad russia into launching nukes at heavily populated ( read blue ) cities , so they have an excuse to nuke them right back . don't have to pay off dirty loans , then . who knows what they will do . it's utter chaos ."
1052,shut up .
1053,"> n the us . he supported a war in iraq also , was that war just ? he cares not about elderly and young dying"
1054,what did he lie about ?
1055,"evidence , please ?"
1056,killing orcs is humanitarian aid
1057,this absolutely is our problem though . helping defend people against a russian invasion is pretty much what our military considered its top priority for a good chunk of the last century .
1058,words equally as common in the 1930s . take a guess who was saying them .
1059,cope more .
1060,"oh look , russian talking points . ukrainians aren't white nationalists , at least for the most part . every country has a few , of course , but there's zero evidence to support that they're any kind of a problem in ukraine ."
1061,"you mean the ruzzian white nationalists who openly say they want to keep ruzzia white ? while geniuses from syria , india , iran etc support them ? don't worry - if you haven't noticed , they can't even win a fight against unarmed trees ."
1062,"yes that's what needed to fight against an illegal invasion where innocent people are having their hands tied behind their back and shot in the back of the head , thousands thrown in mass graves , and your people are being raped and murdered , including little kids . well done for catching on ."
1063,any sams to counter the cruise missile threat seems appropriate at this point . russia's response to losing are more blatant acts of terrorism . they keep posturing and they should invoke nato article 5 to get it over with just so they can't hide war criminals in their sorry ass country from the war tribunals .
1064,"apparently these are to be procured from the manufacturer , which suggests they're new units . hopefully that means there'll be more to come and this is a longer term thing as more can be produced , starting with 2 "" systems "" ( i think batteries , which means more than 2 launchers )."
1065,"the us is buying new systems directly from the manufacturer . so technically as long as the us has money and can source the materials , there is no limit on how many are available . the only limit is the company ability to make new systems"
1066,"> unlike presidential drawdown , usai is an authority under which the united states procures capabilities from industry rather than delivering equipment that is drawn down from dod stocks . this announcement represents the beginning of a contracting process to provide additional capabilities to ukraine's armed forces . they definitely weren't pulled from defending dc , and it sounds like they may be coming from the manufacturer"
1067,"i have been wondering if america might not part with a few m1097 avenger air defense systems since it has over 1000 of those and i suspect parting with say 50 would not have a major impact in the short term , and these would be phenomenally useful against cruise missiles ."
1068,"yes , he should be thanking norwegians ."
1069,"nadams was built to be a forward defense platform that fits between patriot and cwis . we have no current need for that platform , as we aren't anywhere we expect medium range air threats . we are in the process of upgrading them with the newer modified enhanced sea sparrow missiles for increased range . plus the newer launchers are capable of using sidewinders as close in defense against missiles and drones . making it a all in one long to close air support system . these were likely being built for the us for use in that program . though they haven't said if they will get the new capabilities . it would be amazing if they are , as they would benefit from it ."
1070,"i want ukraine to succeed . i want the world to help rebuild ukraine because ukrainians are tough , resilient people with democratic values . i want the russians watching jealously on the other side of the border to envy what they could've been if they weren't trying to murder , bully , and steal from their neighbors . ukraine has paid a debt to the world that money alone will never fully repay . russia will lose . the russian military will be destroyed ."
1071,"russia has always been a terrorist state . something * very * foul runs deep in russian culture that always just allows tyrants to take power . regardless of which government is in charge , russia is * always * pulling the same terror tactics . aka , targeting civilians en masse , throwing as much man power with no real thought zerg rush style , imprisoning dissenters , treating their own military like crap , and having some strongman in charge call all of the bad shots either despite the loss of life or * because * of the loss of life . the one exception may have been when yeltsin was in charge , solely because he was too drunk to actually do anything , and even then the mafia still ran literally everything ."
1072,"nothing stopping them now , except rage ."
1073,second
1074,i am german and i want all those things you described . i wrote to my representative in the parliament that i want him to fight for germany to give more heavy weapons to ukraine and he replied that he is already fighting for it .
1075,"amen my brother from another mother , most americans that talk about this war seem to be united in this thinking"
1076,i'm right there with you .
1077,dont forget japan .
1078,"i want russia to go back to 1999 , to be at that crossroads again , and to take the other path . imagine what the world would be like if putin had not come to power . russia could have been a powerful country - not just on paper - but in reality . it would definitely have sway over all of the former eastern block countries which would have found a strong democratic partner that shared a common culture . the empire they squandered and lost would have been theirs , and not just for a few years , but potentially for decades or even centuries . a soft power empire of influence national friendship and alliances and mutually beneficial wealth , not an evil bloody empire full of thieves and mobsters . the scale of the lost opportunity in 1999 is just unimaginable ."
1079,i'm not american but i agree with everything you said ! except about the pirozhki ... i don't really know what they are haha
1080,i have to disagree . i'm starving so it would have to be a least three . otherwise i'm 300 % behind everything you've said .
1081,"24222 ! but count me in too ! btw , damn well said !"
1082,you said it so much better than i could have .
1083,free tuvan republic motherfuckers !
1084,"also regarding the voices who always have to chime in about respecting russia , this is what we did to germany , btw . go ahead and compare imperial germany to germany today . it has since wound up smaller , freer , richer , better run and far better respected internationally , with an intact german identity . and still wielding disproportionate influence over europe as a great power . russia being the prison of nations is why it keeps being so psychopathic ; only that sort of government and security apparatus could hold all these otherwise independent , better run smaller polities together ."
1085,"when those webs of corruption fall apart . we can then put more focus on things that can create lasting peace for us all . not just in the u.s . but in europe , africa , and in all nations of the world . the weight of opression from rougue far away nations is a factor that can be eliminated to restore peace to democratic , sovereign , and independent nations all together ."
1086,"yep , we are all in , ready to go , and my greatest frustration is that we can't just go fucking do it already . and before some jackass asks , yes , i'm more than happy to be first in line , front and center , donate my own blood to the war . i'm too old and too female for anyone to let me ."
1087,wasn't a free pass given to hackers against russia already ?
1088,i want my kids to never have to see what weve seen
1089,i want galina dub to go out with me too man .
1090,me too bro . they need to be smashed .
1091,well said !
1092,you saved me a lot of typing !
1093,unbelievably based statement sir .
1094,"amen . saddam , check , gadafi , check , assad was saved by putin but his time will come along with his ruzzian boyfriend and the world will be a better place without them ."
1095,only good thing about russia is asylum for snowden . but they do this only to piss off america not for any nice reason .
1096,"speaking from the uk , part of me really wants revenge for using fucking nerve agents on our soil and shooting down a civilian airliner and then putting out bullshit to blame it on ukraine . we were powerless to do anything about these things , until now . now we have a chance to actually punish them for it . it's also an investment in european security for the next generation ."
1097,galina dub ?
1098,"> i want to see freedom for chechnya , degastan , and anyone else living under the russian boots . for the sake of international wrestling , yes please !"
1099,and the russian citizens to smell integrity
1100,"amen , brother ."
1101,amen . let's bring putin and all his lackeys to the 2nd nrnberg trial
1102,as an american i agree
1103,imagine being homeless or without healthcare in america and reading this bullshit .
1104,"and straight after russia , i hope the same happens to the other two superpowers ."
1105,i think you forgot that the us is the other bad guy 
1106,"am i wrong to believe that if pootin doesn't get kicked super hard in the nuts , he or his successor(s ) will keep doing this ? ( he has not yet been kicked super hard in the nuts )"
1107,"to the united states this is the chance to potentially take out our biggest foe of the last century without a single american casualty and completely because of their own incompetence . on top of that it's absolute pr gold . we have the entire world begging us to fight a proxy war . with russia out of the way we lose the huge risk of having to potentially fight a 2 front war against russia and china . we can completely shift our military focus to preparing to fight china . there's literally no down side for us . it's expensive now , but the savings in future military expenditures against russia are worth it . if russia gets broken up over this we could potentially turn a profit ."
1108,"canada is also playing to win . definitely - it is one of the largest overall supporters to ukraine ranking 4-5th for whatever one measures for support : overall aid , military aid , financial aid , etc . and it will do more as it is one of the countries which can afford to do such and there is no lack of will domestically on this issue ."
1109,"germany just wants cheap gas again . germany has no ideals willing to sacrifice for , despite the pretensions of its society and constitution . it's still the same country that cut a deal with hitler to ensure the security and power of business ."
1110,yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
1111,"i think it's important they lose lives , too . this needs to be a multi-generational fuck up that sets a rational inflection point within russian culture . i admit , it will be hard to erase 700 years of imperialist martial patriarchy , but this is a great opportunity if the western world is willing to do the right thing ."
1112,"in hindsight it seems silly , russia is doing great at countering itself to be fair . fucking joke of a military ."
1113,f22 makes sad noises since it'll never be tested against near peer aircraft
1114,you say that but american hegemony has provided more peace for humanity than any other time in history . that military industrial complex has kept in check a lit of bad people from doing bad things .
1115,"hopefully as the war progresses , us will gradually place more trust in ukraine and provide the most advanced weapons ."
1116,aww feivel mousekewitz 
1117,no . the dictator of belarus accidentally released a map which showed that they planned to take moldova next .
1118,"the beard definitely gives him a more rugged look , which makes sense since he has seen a lot of serious shit in the past over 4 months . that , plus the perpetual tiredness in his eyes ."
1119,when a weapon's acronym is harm you know it's some serious shit
1120,> anti-radiation what's the anti-radiation part ?
1121,yes but at some point they have to realize that this war has nothing to to with russian safety and that it's all about putin's personal ambitions .
1122,russia needs a pussy riot .
1123,"russia overthrew the czars before , i still hold hope that they maybe find their bravery and do it again ."
1124,"for now . ukrainians have everything to fight and die for , especially given the russians atrocities . meanwhile , russians don't even know exactly why they're there yet they're getting killed by the thousands ."
1125,the leader of the republican party is a putin fanboy . can't trust republicans .
1126,"we just did , in 2020 . we'll do it again in 2024 . sorry you're an impotent lil bitch simping for russia . lushenko , is that you ? putin is never going to make you a colonel . he's going to get rid of you ."
1127,i am less concerned about the defense hawk politicians and more concerned with how easily manipulated the voters for those people are . i imagine that putin's bot army may eventually win the battle over the hearts and minds of the average republican .
1128,"i think it is important to go out and vote no matter what as hundreds of thousands of people have fought and died for that right to be heard . however with democrat politicians not doing anything to fix the problems that the u.s faces leads dem voters to not vote . things like afghanistan , inflation , oil prices are also exacerbating the problem . even though the dem party is not directly the cause of those things ( yes they are definitely a variable in those things but they are not the main cause .) i am still going to support the dems in the midterms though mainly because i really am trying to avoid the dystopian hand maidens tale government we are headed towards with republicans ."
1129,"republicans are still sucking trumps cock and despite what he says he is very much putins dog , which is proven by a lot of his actions taken during his administration ."
1130,russia is also single-handedly responsible for nato expanding even * more *.
1131,"he is a man without a mask . truly himself with nothing to hide . what he wants is what his people want , he has no other agenda . that is rare and especially rare among politicians . he inspired the whole world to help his country . if zelensky had been in power back in 2014 russia would never have taken crimea ."
1132,"> to be fair ( r ) leaders wanted other countries to up their contribution to nato not simply just leave it to leave it . you're drawing a distinction between republican leaders and trump ? because , according to bolton , gen kelly , and many other maga insiders , trump was absolutely trying to pull us out of nato . the old world republicans fought him on it and ultimately stopped him in his first term , but every day that old version of republican gets more and more scarce . at this point , i don't think an honest assessment can conclude anything other than that the republican party is now the party of trumpism . just look at liz cheney ."
1133,"> i lean right the republican party that used to be centre right is gone . until they start consistently losing , they'll only be enabled to go further right"
1134,"i don't know ... i think i'd prefer the stank . but i mean ... for his own health , yes , he definitely needs a spa day and some r&r . but you know he won't until he knows with absolute certainty that his people are safe ."
1135,the us and videos support . its been such a senseless platitude . ukraine is losing ground in the east and so far turkey has done more than nato and in combined . the news being fed to reddit is very different than is what is actually happening .
1136,if you are comparing this to the start of ww2 you should be tested
1137,"these aren't russian talking points . of course ukraine should retain it's sovereignty and of course they should be helped . the azov battalion and the azov movement in general is super problematic and they are actively being armed and gaining notoriety in they areas they operate . stating that arms given to the ukrainians are not tracked well and arming neo-nazi and neo-nazi adjacent organizations just because they are temporarily aligned with a current objective aren't "" russian talking points "". these are real and concerning problems that don't get playtime on western media . this is a proxy war that you can easily see parallels with afghanistan . remember all those "" brave mujahideen "" fighters ?"
1138,"> they should invoke nato article 5 to get it over with who is "" they "" in this situation that should invoke article 5 ?"
1139,> they keep posturing and they should invoke nato article 5 to get it over with madness .
1140,"this is my poont , they are partly made in norway , where its been said earlier that not many are in stock , and even if kongsberg is a big firm in norway , they dont have a really high output . even if its partly/mainly in norway , only 4 batteries are in use here . i dont see these being produced very fast so lets hope some are moved from nato stock meanwhile(,even if they day its coming directly from manufacturer )."
1141,we purchased them with a gift receipt for ukraine from the manufacturer is my understanding .
1142,"yep . which is great . that means more are likely on the way . a safe/worst case bet would be another 2 in 100 days , assuming this order was placed right at the start of the war and they are just now getting 2 ."
1143,"agreed . i've also been wondering about our old hawks . i have no idea if we still have any sitting around since they have been out of service for 20 years , and they are pretty obsolete . but any additional sam capabilities im sure would be welcomed ."
1144,in the video he also thanked norway for their significant support .
1145,it's a joint effort . norwegian designed system . using us missiles and radar and norwegian launchers and control center . purchased with us funds and built by norwegians .
1146,"agreed . you're describing a governing model that stretched back to the roman empire ..... a strong leader in power until someone else gets rid of him . recent elections since 1990 made that look briefly like it was finished , but then the kgb / putin took control and elective became meaningless.......even if most russian voters believed the lies ."
1147,"they got barely any reason to live in their territory let alone the decreasing youthful population as well as archaic standard of living . they know their population is decreasing and they know it's only a matter of time before their "" younger population "" prefer western capitalism over their shitty system of governance and affairs ."
1148,"> something * very * foul runs deep in russian culture that always just allows tyrants to take power the long and dark winter as a blank canvas for their psyches . then ... fatalism + severe alcoholism + an intractable stance of blaming everyone except themselves , either through obliviousness or a knee-jerk recoil from any sort of meaningful self-awareness . this has reached an extreme point where the only thing these creatures hate more than their own lives ... is other peoples ' lives ."
1149,count me in too 
1150,i bring the motion to the floor . those in favour say ayh .
1151,"i write in emails and with paper letters at least once a month to tell them to send their heaviest weapons to ukraine . i've rarely heard back though . i write from the bottom of the rung to the vp , sec . of state and president . repeatedly ."
1152,what did japan do ?
1153,"the oligarchs would have never allowed it . i think often about what they ( and , of course , putin ) did to boris nemtsov , who would have played a huge part in the "" other russia ,"" you described . nemtsov genuinely was what everyone wants navalny to beand he paid for it with his life . we got the "" worst timeline "" russia , on the scale one might except from sensationalist speculative fiction ."
1154,"at the current pace russia is marching strait towards a reckoning of it's own making , it's failure on this path is guaranteed , it will either suffer a folly so great it will force it's society as a whole to completely question what they're doing or it's going to break russia apart and fragment into smaller republics . whatever happens putin is the one that caused this , the one responsible because of his notions of conquest and his vainglorious ego . honestly russia's fate is similar to weimer germany , putin rose on the back of the russian domestic debt default and shady tactics like the apartment bombings , the country lacked experience with democracy , it's populace lost in nostalgia of a time when russia was powerful . very similar to how hitler rose on the back of the 1929 crash , the ghosts of ww1 and of course the burning of the reichstag . the difference though is that hitlers nazi germany had the ability to wage war and actually had a disciplined military , had developed new tactics of warfare like blitzkrieg , it's defeat was only because it challenged too many nations and should not have declared war on the us . even so the price for its defeat was catastrophic because by the time other powers acted it was too late . they failed to heed the lessons of the first world war and suffered history repeating itself . putin's blyatzi russia is a hollowed out kleptostate that literally rotted in a system of corruption of it's own making , it's leaders corrupt and system of government undisciplined , it was able to get as far as it did because it was riding on the shadow of the former ussr and hide it's real strength . it's invasion exposed the state for all to see , other nations have remembered the lessons of the 2nd world war and ukraine's defiant defence of its homeland have ensured it will not be abandoned . this time around history wont repeat itself . had russia succeeded in conquering ukraine quickly it's likely another greater conflict could have happened down the line , now this wont happen , russia is boxed in , it cannot fight its way out of this only withdraw , it cannot use nukes because that would turn it's defeat into ruination . other countries would not tolerate it as it would send a message russia is a threat that must be destroyed at all costs . it's military is being demilitarised by a smaller nation that's better disciplined and has the full support of the major economies of 2 continents ( 3 if including australia and japan ). whatever the future holds russia must not only lose , it must lose so hard that it can no longer hide in denial at the actions and rot of it's society it must face the consequences and change itself for the better . the rot like putin that caused all this misery must be held to account , purged from power and made examples as to why this must never again happen on european soil ."
1155,"someone else might have been just as bad . this is russia you are talking about . when the soviet union fell , it was a bunch of higher ups that seized the capital and the government ."
1156,"yeah ya do . every culture has their own variation , and they're all delicious . always comfort food . savory or sweet food inside bread , baked or fried . it's a kind of turnover . i didn't know what they were either , i just looked it up , but mmmmmm they look real good , and i can imagine what they must taste like ."
1157,perogy . pierogi . pirogies . potato dumpling excellence . lots of ways to eat them - i like bacon and fried onion and sour cream or just salsa and sour cream with mine .
1158,"how , exactly , could the us have managed the situation so as to avoid war ?"
1159,there was a phone call released from macron that actively shows the west didn't want the war . the phone call that was literally between putin and macron saying that the west would talk and set up meetings to prevent war . the russian government is lying to your face
1160,"people always say this , and then never back it up . how could they have avoided it ? the war was destined to happen since 2014 ."
1161,"tell us your plan but , if you are not ukrainian , *** you don't get to even talk about ***\- ruzzia keeping donetsk , luhansk , or crimea . ruzzia must exit these territories altogther , unconditionally . they must also relinquish claim to any other ukrainian territory they are currently attempting to occupy . any conditions revolving around limitations on ukraine's foreign policy . they must be given free reign to interact with the international community in any way they see fit , consistent with the will of the ukrainian people alone ."
1162,"yes . imo ukraine was the russian state's hail merry . you can see by the , for a lack of a better word , brain-dead push in kyiv that russia was desperate for a quick victory to show how big daddy-putins cock is , but obv it failed spectacularly . after that,if he is still in power , he will be very careful on starting new wars , moreover there aren't any countries around russia that aren't in nato or are joining nato . russia lost already but we must make sure that ukraine doesn't lose too ."
1163,"well it has been shown time and time again that a country that is hungry for conquest is never satisfied , witth each conquest it gets only hungier . for examples see : germany in ww i and ii , france under the napoleon , the mongols , rome , alexander the great and sparta"
1164,as an observer of military this is showcasing the power and strength of the whole us defense department including cia intelligence and supply . the us can launch large scale operations thousands of miles from their borders an russia can barley organize operations next to them . the us military and supply capability is the most impressive in human history and the are playing chess rn .
1165,"100 %. also , russia has been like a meth-ed out troublemaker in your neighborhood that throws rocks at cars and just causes general mayhem . you know which dude is doing it but proving it is always hard . the cops can't really do much without proof and without significant damage . shooting the dude is a bit of an overreaction and there is nothing else to do . so it goes on and on until one day the dude finally gets caught breaking into a house and you and police start piling charges on him because he's a nuisance to everyone involved ."
1166,not only that we are also cutting down to size our biggest political rival in eastern europe and in the middle east . if we are able to cut russia down to size and lessen their political influence that is also billions of dollars that will not have to be spent to try and counter russian influence . like we spend a lot of money in countries like kazakhstan syria and other places to try and counter russian influence and agenda . the more money russia has to spend on the military is less money they can spend on foreign influence . this lets the us able to focus on trying to get influence in the middle east and asia .
1167,"not only that , but we are the good guys for aiding ukraine . taking out russia while being objectively one of the good guys ? this is every american's collective wet dream !"
1168,i have a legit question : so after ww2 the us boomed hard because the war wasn't on our soil ( i'm sure it's more nuanced than that ) do you think after a proxy war like this the us it's looking at a similar boom phase ?
1169,russia would prosper
1170,canada has a huge ukrainian/canadian population who is heavily behind canadian support for ukraine .
1171,"in between on them . on one hand theyve been great non militarily ( really great ), on the other i think more can be sent and the recent announcement on infantry vics is good but comes a bit late ( better late than never ). canada is filled with ukrainians so its nice to have complete support amongst all three parties ."
1172,canada and france are nato but i get your point .
1173,"if russia losing can take out the deeply rooted toxic masculinity and willingness to just accept tyranny mix , then already that's a big step ."
1174,there are no cats in america !
1175,"exactly , this is why russia has to be stopped now"
1176,it's nothing on the [ advanced russian self harm ]( technology .
1177,these are missiles that lock onto radiation sources like radar systems and then fly really fast to blow them up before the radar systems can be turned off to hide .
1178,"a lot do actually . but they can't just leave because attempting to leave will net them death or worse . and it's that or worse that drives home the point . the russian soldiers know how bad the russian army is , and know firsthand what they do to dissidents ."
1179,granted they only overthrew the czar because they were being led by another opportunist by the name of vladimir ilyich lenin .
1180,"americant's actually believe choosing left wing politicians makes any difference whatsoever in their shithole country . how's your shitty healthcare , stagnant minimum wage , pitiful labor laws and women rights violations treating you , sweetie ?"
1181,> because i really am trying to avoid the dystopian hand maidens tale government we are headed towards with republicans that's the main part i don't understand . how can apathetic voters justify not voting when the very really effects of trumps tenure are being seen right now
1182,"i'm a bit more cautious regarding people in general , not just politicians . nobody is perfect and nobody is a complete angel . but yeah , i suppose he's doing what he's doing for the country and the people . it certainly isn't easy to be in shoes ..."
1183,i'll be frank i don't like many if any of the ( r ) leadership though i will say i haven't looked into most of their policies but yea trump was trying to pull us out completely but to be fair to even him ( sadly ) it was after other people had failed to get countries like germany to contribute their required amount when they really should've been i'll also add his main focus was china and he obv wanted resources put towards them and not russia ( he was very wrong )
1184,sadly it looks that way i don't think it is to the level reddit thinks it is at but it is degrading fast even in my eyes
1185,"did you see the clip of him celebrating the candidacy and musing about "" when we will rest """"? first he says they will defeat the enemy and then rest . then he's like "" well , defeat the enemy , rebuild ukraine , then rest "". then he's like "" well , defeat the enemy , rebuild , join the eu , then rest "". and then he's like "" or , maybe we won't rest , because the children would be offended ."" i think that spa day's going to be awhile ."
1186,you're one of the mouth breathers . go dunk your head .
1187,"you could make the argument that turkey has done a lot for ukraine by blocking new russian ships coming into the black sea , which has helped ukraine , there's no denying that , but i'm not sure that really compares to what the us has done ? don't get me wrong , this shouldn't be a pissing contest , but i fail to see how turkey has done more . also turkey is in nato ."
1188,well it definitely has the potential to be the start of ww3 . and for a change america is keeping their soldiers and bombs out . we're literally saving more doing this than actually engaging with russia . you don't know if putin is stupid enough to use nuclear weapons . we most avoid that at all cost .
1189,"ukraine is currently facing an unprecedented existential threat on account of russias unwarranted and illegal invasion . as the mods of r/ukraine , it is our stance that any post or poster that appears to push a pro-russia agenda or pro-russian talking points , no matter how its disguised ( as research , philosophical discussion , etc ), does not belong here . posts which fit these criteria will be taken down , and the user will be subject to a ban at the discretion of the mod team . please do not message us on mod mail about this issue . mod mail is for vital information only . if you message us for something we do not deem vital , you will be muted for three days . being muted means you can not contact the mods for any issue whatsoever . please see the [ faqs ]( and [ rules ]( for more information ."
1190,"i see . let's change that to "" russia will do something really stupid "" to invoke article 5 ."
1191,"even then , we'd most likely ramp up production , especially since it would probably supply more people jobs in these trying times . so even if this was a 100 day long wait , it will get shorter ."
1192,"seems to be a common theme with really capable weapons systems - international cooperation , different countries contributing different things to one weapons system ."
1193,"also , importantly , usa is the name on the gift tag . there has been talk here in norway about giving these systems before , but its pretty clear that we don't want to be the first to give such a capable system , and having it going through the usa is less scary than if we gave it directly ."
1194,"the only way to stop russia , and save humanity as a whole ( including the russian people ), is to absolutely starve out the tyranny complacency culture that they have . just like germany and japan after wwii ."
1195,fourth
1196,"these are the missives political staff place particular importance on . paper letters mail for free to canadian mps , so scrawl away , canadians !"
1197,"ah , interesting . yes maybe paper letters would be an idea ."
1198,"> the ussr declared war on japan in august 1945 invaded japanese-controlled areas of korea and manchuria , swiftly capturing the defenders . moscow kept pows after the war in years of forced labor , a concern that heightened japan's support of the anti-soviet side of the cold war . > > the u.s . had full control of the occupation of japan , to moscow's annoyance . in response moscow refused to sign the 1951 peace treaty . therefore , the state of war between the soviet union and japan technically existed until 1956 , when it was ended by the sovietjapanese joint declaration of 1956 . a formal peace treaty still has not been signed . the key stumbling block to improving relations between the soviet union and japan in the post-war period has been the territorial dispute over the kurils , which are known as the northern territories in japan ."
1199,"well , while we are at it , japan should be held fully responsible for what they did to foreign women ( and men ) during wwii and more importantly they should own up to it , admit it , and teach it in their history classes as a warning of what not to do : the same approach germany took to their nazi past . that said , the current japan is a pretty good nation with pretty good people ( no one and no place is perfect ) and they are an important ally to the western world , and they also have their own beef with russia stealing their territory ( not to mention china's ambitions ). so , my comment is about righting japan's past , not necessarily their present ."
1200,"pirozhki is made with bread and is a kind of turnover , as opposed to pierogi dumplings"
1201,"i guess we could have re-elected trump , who would have withdrawn us from nato ."
1202,"if he isn't in power , the war machine remains , and someone else is ."
1203,yep . russia is trying to light fires by rubbing two sticks together while the united states is walking around with a zippo in it's pocket .
1204,nice analogy - russia is the neighborhood crackhead .
1205,now that is the best description of putin ever . especially if said meth head is always running around butt naked .
1206,"russia's the school bully in a context where no matter what happens the teacher tells you to shake hands and make up . until they deliberately and maliciously hurt a smaller kid on camera , charges are pressed , and people start coming out of woodwork with reports of other shit they're guilty of ."
1207,it's been a long time since i felt we could say we were the good guys . and i'm pissed at what's happening at home . but i'll take helping ukraine as a win .
1208,"i personally went from asking my representatives for even further defense cuts to intentionally making and spreading propaganda in my spare time in a few short months , its crazy what russian imperialism does to a mofo"
1209,yes . it advertises the quality of the arms the us sells compared to another major arms manufacturer . not only that but the good faith this is garnering means a lot outside of the military complex industry . the us is poised to be a major gas exporter to europe and weve already seen a massive increase at the start of this year for obvious reasons . theres also longer lasting things going on here like having a staunch ally in the area and field testing our munitions . unfortunately war is almost always good for the economy of the victors .
1210,and the streets are paved with cheee-eeez !
1211,"interesting . so that surely doesn't do anything against incoming missiles , just aircraft ?"
1212,"shitty . so tf what ? it's always been shitty and we've always had to fight for every inch . y'all just jealous that as bad as it is , we're still the richest , most feared country on the planet and have been for over 100 years ."
1213,> but yea trump was trying to pull us out completely but to be fair to even him ( sadly ) it was after other people had failed to get countries like germany to contribute their required amount when they really should've been who knows what kind of instability/chaos that would of caused in europe had it happened . all because one man believed he was overpaying for peace .. edit : i do think it is a shame that germany was not paying their fair share . i just think that russia had some influence over germany the same way it had influence over the u.s .. the russians were intentionally creating this conflict so that the u.s would leave creating a domino affect .
1214,hes a real g
1215,"i'm a life long democrat who is tired of the "" lets go brandon "" type bullshit . does that make me a "" mouth breather ""?"
1216,putin is a terrible person but he isnt stupid . he's not a wild card like the middle east or north korea . most of his moves are fairly predictable
1217,"gotcha , thanks !"
1218,"jobs are not the issue , not sure about norway but in most of western europe there's a shortage of technically skilled workers . coupled with the chip shortages i'd be impressed if they can produce at normal speeds ."
1219,almost like isolating yourself as a country is a disadvantage

1223,that should be the rule in every democracy .
1224,"thank you ! i was hoping that this was something that would make them stand out . i don't know if you are a male of female but if you've heard of washi tape , i used it to make it stand out a little more over the closure of the envelope , in our beloved blue and yellow , of course ! hey maybe biden saw my letters and it helped him decide to send that heavier weaponry their sending this week . i send it to everyone i know . it's a pain but not nearly as painful as what the ukrainians are going through right now ."
1225,"i do both , then write out my letters by hand . it hurts my hands but i am trying to make the extra effort so they see that people really are passionate about this issue ."
1226,* japan should take the islands ... *
1227,"russia will * never * willingly return those islands to japan because it would mean that the us could set up on them , putting them in a position to blockade russia's only ice-free winter shipping port ( vladivostok )"
1228,oh
1229,"why cant the entire world just do the beer war that canada and denmark did , that would be so much better"
1230,"that's not a good idea , i agree with the morality and sentiment but right now a lot of the smaller countries that japan pillaged over a century ago need modern 2022 japan to help defend them from china and it's constant pressure ... especially taiwan , south korea , philippines , malaysia , singapore , vietnam etc . it's better for japan to make up for it's misdeeds through actively helping those countries with defence , sea-claims , and technology transfers for advanced weapons ."
1231,yea and the us intelligence agencies are dissecting everything russia is doing in ukraine and learning untold information about their operations .
1232,i wish it would hurry up and overdose already .
1233,with you 100 %.
1234,this seems like a serious win for the us at a time where we really need a win . it also seems to be a huge win for the people of ukraine and all the other states that russia bullies . so is this a win-win for just about everyone aside from russia ? obviously it isn't a win for casualties but the troops in the ground are fighting for their home and i don't think there is a more honorable way to die in battle than that .
1235,"no it doesn't . he spent most of his marriage traveling for work . there's never been any evidence of infidelity , or his political opponents would have used it ."
1236,his family is with him .
1237,"yes , if the missile is not emitting radar then this is not the weapon for those . other systems like patriot missile batteries or iron dome are for such targets ."
1238,i 100 % agree it would have been a massive geopolitical mistake this is more or so with the info we know now though and as i said before i would've agreed with the move but not now i mainly just find it moronic and hypocritical of people who had no issue spending what we did during the 20 years of aggressive wars all of a sudden have an issue with providing ukraine support when they are asking for it
1239,"if that's true , then do / s at the end of your post ."
1240,"he's predictable to most level headed . remember when republicans were shouting "" putin will not attack "". now a bunch of republicans are saying he won't attack . well the level headed are saying it's a coin toss . putins ego is severely damaged and who knows what he's thinking"
1241,> verified and confirmed nazi group who confirmed that exactly ?
1242,"really ? to the same scale as *** russia ?*** name one other country that has not only continuously gotten into as many if not * more * wars than the us , but has intentionally employed as many terrorist tactics as possible in every war they were in , and have been doing so for over a solid century if not way * way * longer ."

1248,that was my point . that he wouldn't be getting any if she wasn't there .
1249,they see each other but they're not staying together . she has stated this in recent interviews .

1269,"i guess , little late now :)"
1270,"just a minor correction , iran didn't develop that hatred of the united states out of nowhere . in 1953 us and the brits overthrew their democratically elected government in favor of a brutal dictator ( the shah was very much like saddam husein ). we did this because they were going to nationalize their oil production after the british corporation running it refused to cooperate with the iranian government to ensure iran wasn't being ripped off by them , which they totally were . that's a major reason iran doesn't like us . it's also not the only fucked up thing we've done to iran ."
1271,"> otherwise we'd probably start bombing france or something > if they directly have animosity to us , especially if they either have nukes , are backed by russia , or both so , which one will it be after china : hungary or the baltics ?"

1302,of course if you are not from moscow you get fuck all security .
1303,lol what the fuck did they expect . you cant murder innocents and hope theyll accept you . dumbass russians
1304,sucks to suck .
1305,"uh , isn't that what their army's for ?"
1306,"gee , what a shock ."
1307,don't they know if there on ukraine side of the border > the terrorist putin does not like them any more ? there new designation is cannon fodder . :) go ukraine !!!
1308,good-they should live in fear . if they had any honour theyd off themselves for being traitors .
1309,good place for some disgruntled ukrainian marksman to inflict some insurgency .
1310,it's interesting how so many people support something that would be considered as terrorism if done in middle eastern countries .
1311,i really do not understand how putin thinks this will end . does he think he can occupy the territory and the people will just line up to kiss his hand ?
1312,partisans dont sleep . they hunt .
1313,"targeted artillery from ukrainian territory would give them the willies , if they can live through it ."
1314,> there's you next target boys . go get him ! my first thought when i saw his name . you know they'll be gunning for him one way or the other . not great opsec .
1315,sounds like the perfect job for the himars . all they need is good intel .
1316,the delicious schadenfreude is so thick you could cut it with a knife ...
1317,i seem to recall redditors told putin this on about feb 28th . no way has putin got the resources to keep the lid on his own population and suppress another country .
1318,"i bet they also have deployed "" a lot "" across the occupied areas but they just don't have enough for russia and ukraine . i mean they probably need at least 100k for the currently occupied area and they may have deployed like 20k . they will probably need 500k-1 million for all of ukraine ."
1319,a lot of their typically security forces like rosvardia have been deployed to ukraine . so they might be trying to keep the forces that they have available for internal security
1320,let's hope there is a bayraktar with his name on it .
1321,or sleep forever
1322,"that would have seemed odd to me prior to 2016 , now its just like yeah , sounds about right ."
1323,"to steal a quote , "" one man(or woman ) defending their home , is more powerful then ten hired soldiers . """
1324,"i guarantee you the us could have taken and held afghanistan indefinitely . if , and only if , they committed mass genocide against the population . same as iraq . do not underestimate the arsenal and capability of the us war machine"
1325,death begets more death . they only have themselves to blame .
1326,fighting during a war is terrorism ?
1327,he thinks he can do to ukraine what he did to chechnia . install a brutal lapdog who controls the country with terror and fear .
1328,"no , he thinks he will subjugate them into compliance ."
1329,"that's why they raze cities , shell hospitals and bomb malls , to terrorize ukraine into giving up . that's the only way his incompetent army has any chance to succeed . so far it's backfiring , thankfully ."
1330,"well if all ukrainians are dead , which is his goal , they will put russians everywhere and then putin can visit and all kiss his hand"
1331,he thinks he can wait two years for trump to upend nato .
1332,he will genocide and deport the existing population and replace them with russians . typical soviet strategy .
1333,they should tell him that's what they're doing then line up to shoot him lol
1334,he uses the media to his advantage to brainwash his own countrymen into think he is in the right when he is clearly in the wrong
1335,russia has a history of doing it before . ever wonder why russia is so big ?
1336,"if he goes to kherson , he might get in range for kamikaze drones or artillery - don't waste himars missiles on this guy :) he's not worth it - keep those for russian weapons depots and high value military targets :)"
1337,probably not the wisest move to blow him up with heavy weapons . that makes ukrainian officials more desirable game . better give it more of a grassroots flavour .
1338,"areed , but russia seems to have a hard time feeding the soldiers deployed now . how will they feed 500k to 1 million more ? it is always about logistics ."
1339,"no one could do that in afghanistan , doubt they have the resources here either ."
1340,impossible . russia already destroyed twice the amount of bayraktars then has ever even existed
1341,keep them too scared to sleep and they will be physically and psychologically weak and therefore might make mistakes .
1342,attacking civilians to achieve political goals is considered terrorism .
1343,"would love to tell you that you are wrong , but we both know you are not ."
1344,yeah except putin's a moron who can't do math . chechnya population around 1 million give or take during war . ukraine population 44 million minus refugees . russia does not have enough people to occupy ukraine without a co-operative partner that does not and will not exist .
1345,"didn't work in ww2 , didn't work in vietnam , doesn't work today ."
1346,he's already telling his base that the us shouldn't be sending money to ukraine . i worry more for ukraine than the us in the 2024 election . whatever promises biden makes can just be reversed by trump or desantis
1347,"it's funny that everyone thinks trump would upend nato when in reality he was pushing european nations to fund defense in the way they are just now doing . imagine how much support we could have given ukraine if every nato ally started spending at least 2 % gdp on defense in 2016 , like trump wanted ."
1348,"to be fair , hes a great target . the guy sent to the occupied territories to convince bureaucrats afraid theyll be killed if posted there himself gets killed in front of their eyes right there . sure not worth the himar strike , but def worth targeting ."
1349,if i paid artilery grenade with his name on it i want it done !
1350,yeah that is my point . seems nuts particularly when their economy is getting hit and they are also running an army . equipmenting this many police offices would be the challenge . i am guessing they would have a ton of plain clothe units both as spies and because they can't afford uniforms . maybe they are just going to round people up location by location and send half of them to russia and kill the other half . then bring in obedient russians .
1351,"we couldve managed afghanistan if wed kept using b-52 bombers against head chopping , suicide bombing narco gangs rather than pretend theres such a thing as a civilian in the tribal hinterlands . ( the cities , sure , in the rural countryside if youre at war with an insurgent or terrorist and his clan , his wife and cousins are 100 % on board .) reminds of the german raid that one commander greenlighted on captured gas tankers a village was stealing from that set half the village people on fire . the top german commander came to apologize to the chief of the villages in this area and was angrily told off by the chief that if they did that another 2-3 times thered be no more taliban in the area. this was of course one of the most peaceful northern areas in afghanistan in which the germans were ineffectually sitting and doing basically nothing as things got worse . security contractors are so much better and loyal than useless allies . the taliban and al qaeda do find the extreme application of our values , not to mention our values themselves , hilarious , and they mock us . im not saying we should change our values , but the way we applied them in afghanistan was retarded ."
1352,russia forced the mother of the unborn engineer who was going to design bayraktar tb-3 to have an abortion .
1353,during a war officials of the occupier are always legitimate targets . it was that way in wwii . it was that way in every conflict . it's only terrorism to those that support the occupying forces . edit : and you have the nerve to talk about terrorism .
1354,civilians ? they are russian invaders . they know they are not welcome and that it is not safe .
1355,"i mean , he * thinks * he can do that , yeah ."
1356,this is why biden is cranking the aid out as fast as he can .
1357,"trump , the guy who tried to withhold military support until ukraine scratched his back by smearing his political opponents son ? trump , the chosen candidate of putin ? trump who disrespected our countrys intelligence agencies and military members in favor of putin ? putin wanted trump because he knew all he had to do was lend trump money and tell him he was a good businessmantrump would eat it up and end up unable to pay off his business losses in any legal wayso you knowa private meeting here and there . a little turning a blind eye when told to do so and presto ! debt is gone . trump let russian operatives into high offices of the usa , even after being warned that they were foreign agents ."
1358,trump was literally impeached for withholding aid to ukraine till they did some evidence falsifying for him . he is also * toight * with the russian mafia and oligarchs . his bitching about nato contributions was his set up for leaving it .
1359,lol trump who thought natos underfunding would be paid to the us .
1360,trump and the republican party turned into kremlin propagandists . trump supporter go fuck your self . trumps complicit in helping putin . he blackmailed the ukrainian president by withholding crucial aid to ukraine when they desperately needed it if ukraine didnt help get made up dirt ( conspiracy theories ) on his political opponents son . he advocated for the removal and defunding of nato . fuck him . and some of his closest advisors publically said why arent we supporting russia . so fuck steve bannon and his conservative nationalist bs . both are a pos . everyone knows trump has always had close ties to the klemlin dating back decades . russian state media uses republican fox news hosts ( tucker bitch carlson ) as pro russian propaganda on russian tv stations . republicans always talk about ukrainian bio labs and push conspiracy theories that arent helping ukrainian citizens who are being attacked . trump is telling his supporters not to send money to ukraine now . fuck yourself
1361,100 % worth the strike . the value from the damage to morale alone would be worth it .
1362,using the himar would send a message and probably take out a lot of his staff which would cripple that much more .
1363,weighty argument . unsure now .
1364,russia tried that in afghanistan . actually that was basically the british strategy too
1365,"you need to look up the definition of civilian . btw , i am not against what is being done . but let's be consistent . when palestinians kill israeli police in occupied palestinian land , they are branded as terrorists ."
1366,"trump was awful on ukraine , turkey and syria , and a traitor who tried to coup the government ( much the same as blm ), but do recall obama betrayed all his allies ( from eastern europe to the middle east , to democratic movements in cuba that got crushed after he apologized and listened to raul castro for an hour , thus giving castro the green light to smash the opposition , to the iranian democratic movement that obama didnt want to taint by supporting ), and also refused to even send javelins to ukraine , and didnt support the pro-western winners of the election in iraq and pulled out of iraq without even asking for a sof which wouldve been easy to get . trump was worse , although with good ideas on china , but obama was a foreign policy and military disaster too , its just that trump makes him look less awful ."
1367,"it's really tiring to see out of touch redditors clinging to conspiracy theories like this , with no real evidence besides "" anon sources "" from cnn and msnbc ."
1368,"that statement has no basis in reality . he wanted all nato nations to pay 2 % so europe can handle most of it's own defense , and the us can pivot to china ."
1369,"> he blackmailed the ukrainian president by withholding crucial aid to ukraine when they desperately needed it if ukraine didnt help get made up dirt ( conspiracy theories ) on his political opponents son . he advocated for the removal and defunding of nato . you are repeating democrat talking points verbatim while not realizing this garbage was debunked . i swear this is word for word from msnbc . like my first comment trump wanted to force all nato nations to pay 2 % gdp on defense . germany was and still is a bitch about defense spending . once again , imagine how much aid they could have provided if they spent 2 % like they are obligated to ? the difference between republicans and democrats is that dems are ok with the us being the sole supporter of ukraine , republicans want europe to pay their fair share . get your head out of your ass and realize that if trump had his way , nato would be stronger than it is now and germany would be sending you 30 panzerhaubitze instead of 3 ."
1370,"if the partisans can get to him , even better . its one thing to be able to go back and say oh that ukrainian army with their pesky western weaponry! . its another for the people to watch his zinc casket kicked out the back of a cargo plane amongst whispers about he was supposedly in a safe zone . spark the blaze , partisans !"
1371,"agree . rub him out the day he arrives , maybe even as he's chairing his first meeting . "" good day puppet lackeys of kherson oblast , thank you for attending my first meeting . our first order of business is to address the rise of the partisan activity in ... kerpoww !"""
1372,russians didn't have the support of as much as the population as the us had .
1373,except blm never tried to do a coup
1374,"yeah , russian white collar workers are probably chomping at the bit to get that plum assignment of going to be a russian figurehead in the country that russian soldiers are bombing into dust . thatll be a fun ride to work going through the rubble of malls , cultural centers , train stations , hospitals , homes and schools that russia has targeted . this war is a blight on russia , and all those involved should be ashamed and embarrassed ."
1375,"this was all done in the open for everyone to see . it isn't some "" leftist conspiracy ""."
1376,trump literally did it in front of everybody .
1377,"tump and all the maga types are crooks , just like his buddy putin . did you see mtgs take on the ukraine war ? we have wasted the opportunity to be putins friend !? wake up , the people you are defending are traitors ."
1378,"qannon was a fcked up , semi-religious support group for trump"
1379,exactly
1380,"he told the new york times in an interview published thursday that doing so would depend on whether those countries had "" fulfilled their obligations to us "" linky :"
1381,"let's be clear , the republican party's contribution to inclusiveness has been voting in retarded americans as president for the last few decades . edit : spelling ."
1382,now you know how ukrainians feel about trump and his republican lap dogs
1383,except all of that insane bs was put on trial in congress and debunked . yet you parrots can't help youselves and keep repeating the same tired bs over and over .
1384,"yall are so caught up in your own bs that you can't help but post "" jokes "" that aren't remotely relevamt to the subject being discussed ."
1385,i don't know what you watched .... but nothing was debunked . republicans didn't even try to address the facts . and an impeachment really isn't a trial . conspirators usually don't get to sit on the jury . what we did see is republicans voting based on party rather than the evidence
1386,your conspiracy networks are not news
1387,"first , y'all \* second , have you considered that when everyone disagrees with you , it's not because you're right but because you're wrong ? third , jokes are the best response to putting members of the retarded american community into power , so suck it ."
1388,"> second , have you considered that when everyone disagrees with you , it's not because you're right but because you're wrong ? this goes both ways , you might be a narcissist if you don't think so . also how progressive of you to make jokes at the expense of people with mental disabilities ."
1389,understatement of the century
1390,also exposed russia literally has the gas and oil power .
1391,r/economy ukraine has exposed russia as a not-so-great power . where's the economy here ?
1392,there are an impressive number of russian trolls spreading misinformation in this thread .
1393,"but , you have to admit , they're world class threat makers . second only to iraqi minister of foreign affairs , bagdad bob ."
1394,"this is propaganda , pure and simple ."
1395,yeah it only took some 5 billion dollars in foreign aid
1396,""" afghanistan has exposed us as a not-so-great power ."" i think the bigger takeaway is foreign occupations are hard to pull off in the modern era ."
1397,"what in the bullshit . whenever i hear oh russia has 40 % inflation ; well we got 20 % over here minimum . and at the end of this freakin war , they potentially get ukraine which is one of the world most resource bountiful countries in the world , and we get lower real wages / high gas prices ??? yeah , winning is so fun/s"
1398,russia is so powerless all of europe needs to unite together in a military alliance against it
1399,the fact theyve engaged in this fight at all is damning . seeing how poorly theyve done more so .
1400,"a measure of russia's power inst its ground forces sir , your being niave lol"
1401,wow russia not so great power . this generation is so out of touch with what ultimately matters . enough nuclear weapons to destroy the world ten times or more over . i'd say they are a great power .
1402,"if russia is not-so-great power , then why are us & eu gov blaming russia for world-wide inflation ? blaming a not-so-great power state for highest inflation rate in 40 years is nonsense , bcs if they are responsible for such high inflation rate , then they must be showing a so-great power ( which they don't have ) against the global economy ."
1403,wapo ? 
1404,the media has told the sheep that russia is not a great power and they go baaaaah .
1405,propaganda
1406,"im not so sure . i think russia is winning this war . maybe not in ukraine , but thats just a consolation prize at the end of the day . theyve basically showed europe that they need russia . they are probably going to strengthen their relationship between china and other brics countries . and they have further increased inflation in the us and around the world which will lead to further social unrest here in the us . they might lose the battle for ukraine , but putin has definitely won his war . also , by the us and europe imposing sanctions and russia being cutoff from swift , it shows to other countries what could happen to them if they dont obey . so much for further globalizing the world with the us at the head of it . i dont agree with the war in ukraine , but putin played his hand and the us and europe fell for it ."
1407,"never said most advanced , but willing to fight to the last person how about you . how much fighting are you willing to fight , it will be bloody with hundreds of thousands of lives lost even millions if it becomes world war.we won't just fight russia , you miss the alliances , the west versus the rest , we don't know who side china and india is on.its a mess that is growing"
1408,only after the west cut nearly all trade to russia and gave ukraine billions of dollars in weapons to fight . i dont think it means russia is a not - so - great power more that if you give someone 50 billion in weapons that youll stand a much better chance then what your own country could ever hope to produce
1409,"yeah russia isn't important yet due to them , the entire world's cost of gas has doubled . fossil fuels matter whether you want them to or not ."
1410,nato propaganda shit . russia is at least in the top 3 most powerful nations(with china and usa )
1411,more coverage at : * [ russia-ukraine war : zelenskiy accuses russia of deliberate terror ; uk condemns exploitation of captured britons latest updates ( msn.com )]( * [ blasts rock ukraine's mykolaiv after russian missiles kill 21 near odesa ( reuters.com )]( * [ ukrainian airborne assault troops reportedly take out convoy of russian ammo vehicles ( newsweek.com )]( --- ^( i'm a bot to find news from different sources .)

1412,"we have given more $ to the ukraine in 5 months than spent in the first 2 years of iraq . we just had the worst 1/2 of a year for our markets in generations , inflation is at a 40 year high and we will be in a recession soon . id say russia is doing a pretty good job . we just dont realize we are the ones losing ."
1413,"again , not related to economics ."
1414,"russia has been a regional power since the ussr's collapse . it's just our region is rather large . and so is the logistically possible military expeditionary force . doesn't necessarily make the industry , military all powerful and capable . but it does make them a contender in both military means and strategic materials in a large section of the world . no one is going to ignore russia due to there failures in this war . half the world will continue to not care , and those who already cared will probably continue to care ."
1415,russia has achieved every objective . dont believe the media
1416,[ where do i start .
1417,ukraine exposed nato and eu as not so great power either :) ukraine will be reduced slightly .
1418,"taiwan : "" let's do china next ..."""
1419,"as an american who hates what russia is doing in ukraine , i disagree . it seems to me the war in ukraine is one step in a much bigger plan . a change in the global economic power structure is perhaps quietly taking place . misdirection is a common war time tactic , and the ground war in ukraine is the misdirection to what is happening behind the scenes to the global economic order . you may point out sanctions , the sanctions have done nothing to weaken the russian economic position . allowing them to sell oil for rubles instead of dollars was part of the plan imo . additionally , usas unilateral action to steal assets/properties from russian citizens because reasons isnt sitting well with the international community who now wonder when if ever it will be there turn to draw the ire of the us . this article makes many good points about the current state of the russian economy , i am of the opinion that perhaps the ground war was a way to accelerate a change in the economy and shore up its many faults . very easy to dismiss/underestimate the opposition . tf do i know tho , just a person on reddit offering my 2c"
1420,"russia is fighting the collective "" west "" from australia to america to europe and is gaining ground in ukraine ... what it's exposed is that we aren't as strong economically or militarily as our leadership has projected us to be . removing russia from swift wasn't a death sentence for the ruble , but it did undermine the petrodollar ."
1421,"this isn't news and we didn't need this war to expose this . as far as world powers goes it's china and the u.s . about dead even with each other , then the eu , then everyone else who's essentially irrelevant . the only threat russia has is their great nuclear ability and their oil reserves ."
1422,"interesting , because a couple months ago , everyone was worried the russians were going to take over all of europe and i was called a biggot for pointing out this exact thing out ."
1423,"but joe biden says russia is to blame for inflation , trump winning the election , cyberattacks , and pretty much everything that is wrong in the world today . if joe's claims are right , isn't that an argument for russia being a great power ?"
1424,clown justin and the liberal circus is so out of touch . not only with canada but the whole world . such an embarrassment . canada has gas & oil but trudope is to stupid to use these resources . sorry ukraine and europe but the so called leader is jetting around the world doing squat .
1425,it never was . thats the point
1426,might want to rethink the transition to communism
1427,i can barely comprehend the amount of neoliberal brainrot required to rationalize the view that russia is weak or losing this war .
1428,russia is nothing . we should drop boots and end the ukrainian war .
1429,"i mean , pretty obvious to everyone considering russia can't even afford tanks newer than the ones they made in 1972 ."
1430,russia turned out to be nothing but myspace angles
1431,more on this subject from other reputable sources : --- - economist ( a ): [ does a protracted conflict favour russia or ukraine ?]( - insider ( b -): [ james mattis rips putin's ' pathetic ' military performance in ukraine ]( - newsweek ( b -): [ russia admits it's running out of weapons in ukraine war ]( - news.com.au ( b -): [ disgusting : putin hits back at bojos taunt ]( --- [ __extended summary__ ]( | [ more : does a protracted ...]( | [ faq & grades ]( | i'm a bot
1432,"not only , they exposed them as the ones who never have to had a business with them in their territory , see examples mc and ikea"
1433,other than the nukes they are a banana republic 
1434,[ how are you guys a superpower ?!](
1435,the problem is that theyll always have nukes to threaten with . just like north korea that weve been able to do nothing about even though we could easily destroy their military .
1436,still a nuclear power .
1437,"i can't figure how russia can maintain any standard of living for its population and find the money for nuclear weapons , a space program , and foreign wars . oh , it can't . pretty sure every nation that pursues nuclear weapons has a low standard of living : north korea , pakistan , iran , etc ."
1438,"tbh , this article has a decent premise but almost no meat to back it up . thinking the author could elaborate a bit more"
1439,"obviously it's more than just their fighting capabilities . we've seen russia force european countries to warn about low natural gas supplies , have recommend rationing gas usage , seen energy prices spike , and even become coal burners once again ."
1440,that is false bcz simply russia fighting all nato !
1441,"russia is being bled of equipment and personnel . they wanted a fast decisive victory , but did not have a clear strategic plan to achieve it . they have been reluctant to deploy their top equipment or personnel because ukraine has become a meatgrinder . they do have a few next generation weapons but not enough to take the chance . the rate that they are losing equipment and men will cost them in the next ten years . they are taking territory , but the way they are taking it is by scorched earth . they are using wwii tactics and that is going to take trillions to rebuild ."
1442,nobody thought russia was a great power before the war
1443,noooo you can't just say that about glorious nu soviet russia ! noooooo .
1444,"when was r/economy run over by idiots ? the comment section seems to think putler is a genius , lol ."
1445,was this a seriously mystery to anyone at this point in time ?
1446,you mean ukraine * and all of the multitude of countries sending it aid* 
1447,russia has been usurping ukraines commodities to make amends for their diminished resources . the oligarchs are useless as their assets have been stripped along the way and have no leverage .
1448,ukrainians literally stole their tanks ! what would happen when they start stealing trigger codes ?
1449,start out of context then dig your own whole ! mine is closed for repair !
1450,its too bad that ruzzia can still carpet bomb inside a sovereign country . not so great in any way .
1451,then why are most countries increasing their military budget ?
1452,"i don't think the world was concerned about russia alone , but russia being chummy with china , and china being chummy with north korea , adds to their military capacity ."
1453,i wonder what that says about iraq and afghanistan then !
1454,"much like the usa - vietnam , iraq , afghanistan ..."
1455,"and this not so great power is responsible for 7 bucks a gallon , a new holodomor and a energy crises in europe ? hehe...tell me something more ..."
1456,"the only ppl benefit from war is the elite nobody wants to be involved with this but yet we keep getting involved and adding which is why we are suffering if we stop all military funding to the black budget we could easily not need oil , gas , especially war if we just start ignoring them , stop supporting them"
1457,why do they keep using video game footage ?
1458,im surprised at the other comments . is everyone else suggesting that ukraine should be doing this well against a major world power ? beyond the nuclear threat - what military success does russia have recently ?
1459,lately i've been applying what i call british politeness such as not-so-great to my speech . it all started when the duchess of cambridge was less-than-pleased with the duke of cambridge dancing with women-other-than-his-wife .
1460,a not so great power with nukes
1461,germany almost captured moscow in ww2 .
1462,the finest journalistic integrity .
1463,guessing russias nukes dont even work at this point .
1464,the king is really naked .
1465,"it doesn't matter , they have china to back them ."
1466,"this is a good discussion . people trying hard & talking about stuff that really matters . one key is despite some of the insightful comments here a/b russias performance in the war , russia is sophisticated in nuclear weapons . and that kind of freezes the situation in a way . b/c of its nuclear weapons situation , it is impossible to force regime change in russia . ignore the propaganda on all sides . the world and regular people & russians & ukrainians need a negotiated peace that is obeyed w/o anyone interfering & it needs to be soon ."
1467,until the nukes are out
1468,thanks to the american taxpayer .
1469,so why did zelensky cry and ask everyone for help lol
1470,3.6 roentgens . not great . not terrible .
1471,opinion piece . why do people keep discounting the billions in aid ukraine received ? even zelensky admitted kyiv would have fallen in march without the thousands of anti tank/air weapons the us sent them .
1472,theyve exposed nothing other than billions of dollars in us military aid can defeat an army who are using aging weapons and have low morale . this is a war by proxy .
1473,no you don't say . it's american politics about creating a monster to unify the people and or scare them ...
1474,wonder who will be next / s
1475,"but 1,000s of nukes will keep buying them a seat at the table "
1476,this article does a great job showing how little anybody actually knows . the us got beaten by vietnam and afghanistan and didnt really win in iraq or have any successes recently either . and we had better hardware and enemies considered to be weaker .
1477,"i don't know , they've got 80 more years to try again and fail even harder"
1478,aren't those prereq's for being a super power ?
1479,"russia has no buying power , no domestic semiconductor manufacturing to speak of , and their army is so outdated that they might as well be running punch cards and enigma machines . the war effort has demonstrated that russia can't manufacture anything , isn't attracting smart people to work there and/or invent things , can't fund research , can't fund their own social good , and are basically persistently on the brink of a total economic collapse . also they defaulted on their loans recently , which is kind of a big deal . wars demonstrate a nation's production capabilities , and their general functional knowledge base . if a country can't manage to field anything newer than about 50 years old , it's a safe bet that they haven't managed to keep anyone with a rudimentary understanding of engineering in the country ."
1480,def more of a geopolitics post or military post
1481,your economy is the most important of winning a war . bad economy = terrible war effort . russias economy is utter trash .
1482,"that's a good ol propagandist at work , just ignore them , they are everywhere"
1483,it doesnt exist . this sub is just r/socialist now
1484,"this is an economic war as much as it is a real war in terms of direct military engagement . i think russia is what it is , and i don't think anyone really believed they were a global superpower before this war . so this reads more like propaganda from a certain angle , while for the most part , russia is playing its hand fairly well , while the ones with all the chips look like fools ."
1485,"nope , we all know while west is fighting a proxy war in ukraine against , russia in ukraine and russia is actually winning , we like it or not .... and it's going to create a new world order ...."
1486,i only follow this sub still because deep down i enjoy how much these awful posts trigger me
1487,daily dose of ukraine spam .
1488,is that a satirical question ?
1489,shills need to work overtime due to inflation ...
1490,"yeah simply because everyone eho doesnt agree with you is a troll . lets ignore how badly ukraine is being whipped right now with city after city falling to the russians , the russian economy that shows no signs of slowing down and an ever more desperate ukraine asking for more arms and ammo . its all cus we're trolls mate . not like your media or politicians would ever lie to you ."
1491,sorry baghdad bob but korean kim already claimed second place
1492,"if russia was the power they claimed to be , they should've rolled over ukraine before a single bullet of foreign aid made it there ."
1493,"haha yeah , ukraine isn't alone , but they are funded , have the morale high ground , and the crowd . they are still mostly doing all the heavy lifting though . russia trying the blitzkrieg when countries can just watch you set up for weeks before from the sky"
1494,and the war map show other thing . the post it is just propaganda
1495,a country with allies is more powerful than one without .
1496,great countries have allies comrade
1497,"if russia went all out , there would barely be a ukraine"
1498,its like 1 billion per day ?
1499,how is it just 5b ? more like 50-100b .
1500,"heard the argument that ukraine's army was basically as well funded or better funded than russia . the gist was ukraine's stole purpose was to counter a russian invasion . large parts of the russian military budget is in their navy , nukes , to a lesser extent air force etc . that are all sidelined in this conflict . their ground forces wasnt that well funded . can't find the source for the life of me . anyone here know where it was ?"
1501,well afghanistan a different animal but your right people are to aware that they can revolt that's why they never work but on top of that this is conventional warfare not vc shit there dealing with and having western weaponry has helped em a lot they would have much harder time without support
1502,that was a completely different fight .
1503,we marched in with ease and stayed for 20 years . not the same .
1504,"not so great super power ?? dude have you seen when we invade ? its the real deal ! ive seen your invasion videos , a bunch of drunks in farm trucks from the 70s and in stolen cars ."
1505,thank goodness cause its definitely laughable
1506,would they actually use them ? have they been upkeeping them ? are they hypersonic ? are they accurate ? just cause a country says they have big guns doesn't mean they are useful but you can never know for sure it's only america and russia that have that much power russia has more yet the us spends more on upkeep
1507,"yeah , people tend to forget that most countries in nato have become consumer dominated economies and don't actually produce physical goods for the world . it's funny how all these weak , feckless countries are foolish enough to warmonger against countries that feed them and heat their homes ."
1508,close enough 
1509,what about it ?
1510,does that include the land they already took in 2014 when they first invaded ? either way not that impressive when you look at the size of the russian military .
1511,"at their current rate of conquest ( approx 0.5 % per month ) they will run out of munitions , men and most critically * morale * long before they can conquer ukraine . whereas ukraine is getting more western weapons and munitions by the day "
1512,and 90 % of the coastline
1513,their goal was 100 % of the country in 72 hours .
1514,"cool , cool...now do afghanistan ."
1515,"this war is much bigger than ukraine . it is really a war with nato . a russian battlefield victory would embolden other countries like china and iran to challenge the us in their regions as well . if china attacks taiwan , and the us gets bogged down in east asia , it would create an opening for russia to finally attack a nato country and see what happens . we all know that the invasion of taiwan is coming . it is only a matter of time before the us is faced with the choice of open war against russia and china simultaneously , or back down and shown to be a paper tiger ."
1516,most insightful comment
1517,"i don't think you quite understand . if the reliance on russian resources is so great , the war with ukraine has diminished russias capability for war to an even greater extent . the war in afghanistan was longer and used fewer resources , yet in a shorter time period russia is resorting to outdated weapons to stay in the fight against a smaller military . in all honesty , if i were russia , i would be very worried about china . the only thing russia has to hold back the threat of an invasion on their own soil is nuclear weapons , but based on how poorly russia has maintained their frontline weapons is one sure that their nuclear missile stockpile is actually capable of reaching a target , even if in europe ? i have my doubts ."
1518,theres absolutely no propaganda here !
1519,not by a mile - russia arent needed in europe . the energy sector are booming big time and the energy will come from other places . have fun in fascist fantasy russia .
1520, ok vladi
1521,every objective ? list them all and explain how each of them has been achieved .
1522,my favorite objective was when that lame ass boat sunk and they lost 500 people
1523,how is that 500 mile long russian convoy doing just outside of kyiv ?
1524,"yes , their key objective being their own military humiliation , bizarrely ."
1525,"in addition , the current administration is trying to get china and india to our side using threats in a typical arrogant fashion rather than sweetening the deal . you could probably get the better long term gain by giving india $ 40b of free nato weapons than giving it to ukraine ."
1526,"of course not . their army was complete shit in chechnya and georgia and even in crimea . the only reason they won those wars while nato failed in other conflicts is because russians don't engage in mission creep ( probably because they can't afford to ) while western politicians love to paint themselves into a corner with impossible objectives . russia's winning strategy is to take a bit of land , quickly run out of supplies , squat down waiting for their failing logistics to amass capacity for a larger offensive that never comes , then their enemy goes bankrupt trying to dislodge them and they declare victory . what's hilarious is that this has never failed them so far ."
1527,"failing to capture or hold anything that is not a border region to russian/belarusian ( which they lost the belarus sides ) borders is really quite the demonstration they aren't winning or strong . most of that was horrible tactics but i'm sure this is just a russian parroting bot i'm engaging so , props to * trying * to stand by russia"
1528,okay i'll bite ... describe how russia is strong and winning . as long as i get to check back in a few months .
1529,i hope youre first in line and leading the line
1530,nothing is stopping you from volunteering for the ukrainian army .
1531,"well you're a real piece of warmongering shit , aren't ya ? this would be the best way to get a lot of young men killed , for nothing . noam chompsky said it a month or two ago , trump is the only prominent politician advocating a humane solution , which is cease fire , negotiation , agreement . people like ron paul of course , somehow , never get the mainstream public ear . you send us boots you're declared world war three , and we're damn near there as it is with all the missiles we've sent , for nothing but more dead ukrainians and russians . we're in economic war and have been since we kicked russia off of swift . oh but we'll keep funding the saudis in yemen , no crying about that from you npcs"
1532,and america was ask jeeves .
1533,"if russia was fighting all of nato in a conventional war , the battles would be taking place on the other side of the border long ago ."
1534,"even russia probably didn't care if you call it a great power , or a regional power , or anything else . for russia , it's an existential question whether they will have a country of 40 million people with a large nato-aligned army on its borders or not ."
1535,taking the 1/3rd of ukraine that has the most natural resources in 6 months ?
1536,because they are even worse
1537,the fact that russia relied on ukraine's lte network for military communications was a good sign they are out of step with modern military capabilities .
1538,"> no domestic semiconductor manufacturing to speak of they do , but the smallest node size they can reliably do is 90 nm , whereas the rest of the world is at < 10 nm . 90nm is roughly equivalent to early 00's tech"
1539,"they defaulted on their loans because the banks wouldnt allow them to pay iirc . otherwise , i agree with your statement haha ."
1540,"nobody on these threads including myself holds a crystal ball power , but i believe that russia will no longer be russia anymore within the next 10 years especially because they put themselves on the electric chair with a wet sponge on their head already smh first was the "" ultimate mother country""aka the ussr which was just some hoax bullshit to brainwash citizens if you ask me , then they became russia , next they might be become the united states of northeast asia ? lol"
1541,"i dont know where you live and what media you follow , but i strongly recommend to check about the real data on russia . russia is one of the very few countries with most ( variety of ) commodities , oil , gas , minerals which you definitely need if you want to build technology especially the younger generation thinks that something like netflix or spotify will fill their stomachs wait until you really feel the pain , then you might realize that everything what counts is good , water and energy"
1542,"i wonder how a country with no semiconductor industry can make international space station , make sukhoi jets , hypersonic weapons , s500 , submarines , had largest number of engineers working for boeing outside us . they have oil , food , natural resources , and educated population . so they are not as helpless as you are making out to be ."
1543,"don't be fooled , it's a set up.nothing is as it appears . the att of war , look weak in front of your enemy . ukraine is not the objective , what is the real purpose of the war , who is russia really preparing to fight . don't get fooled it's a set up ."
1544,"they didn't want to , money went into someone else's pocket lol"
1545,"well good propaganda . no buyign power , in regards to what ? militarily that is false . plenty of scientists and researchers specifically choose to move out of neighbouring countrys to study and work out of moscow . why do you think that is ? and "" semi confuctor manufacturing is pretty worthless to mention . russia is a superpower for a reason , because of resources . none of the last part has anything to do with russia , moreso economic sanctions that happened this year and it clearly isn't effecting russia in the long run either . ruble was predicted to be worthless , but that's false . us & co will move on by next year , same as they all did with crimea and their virtue signaling ."
1546,"> also they defaulted on their loans recently , which is kind of a big deal . that's a bit misleading . they simply weren't allowed to pay their loans . they have the money but because of sanctions they aren't able to pay their foreign creditors , once a certain period of time passes the creditors just shrug their collective shoulders and stamp the big red defaulted stamp on their proverbial manila folders . i understand and agree with your post except the point i mentioned : default was not because of a lack of money ."
1547,slaps roof of other guys comment : just look at how much economy you can fit in this baby !
1548,they only defaulted on their debts because we froze their accounts . it would be like wells fargo saying you defaulted on your mortgage a month after wells fargo freezes your savings account .
1549,"> wars demonstrate a nation's production capabilities you know , all countries stopped to produce so much weapons in the last 20 years , all armies are a little ' outdated ', and it's even a good thing ."
1550,and what does that say of their nuclear capabilities ? those require a diligent service and maintenance regime which they haven't demonstrated in other areas .
1551,"capitalism was terrible for them , that's why the us imposed it on them and appointed putin ."
1552,that would be nice if it were true
1553,"here's a sneak peek of / r/socialist using the [ top posts ]( of the year ! \ 1 : [ helen keller ]( | [ 1 comment ]( \ 2 : [ rei is union busting . if youre a member , you can send them an email : board.com ]( | [ 0 comments ]( \ 3 : [ happy mlk jr . day comrades , don't let liberals disarm dr . kings message of economic revolution ]( | [ 4 comments ]( ---- ^^ i'm ^^ a ^^ bot , ^^ beep ^^ boop ^^| ^^ downvote ^^ to ^^ remove ^^| ^^[ contact ]( ^^| ^^[ info ]( ^^| ^^[ opt-out ]( ^^| ^^[ github ]("
1554,"so , us , a country with over 120 % public debt , an outstanding amount of printed money and a critical overbought stock market condition decides to sanction russia , a country with 18 % public debt and a very small foreign debt , by forcing bunch of countries ( europe ) to join the sanctions and treatening the other half of the world . us doesn't export anything and european countries are 80 % dependant on the enemy country energy . to do so , they fuck the swift , they lose the dollar-oil peg , they cause an oil/gas rally , a stock market crash , a recession , and increase the risks of a global famine . more than a geopolitical strategy all these seem to me the spites of a fat spoiled child , but maybe i'm missing something ."
1555,"it's more biden having ties in ukraine , his son was ' working ' there.most of the shit against trump being "" russian "" came from dossiers manufactured by hillary clinton attorneys.if drumpfs was a putin puppet , why didn't they invade ukraine 5 years ago ? it would have been much easier !"
1556,"ukraine was/is also a good source of funds for biden's family , so the domestic politics division fits nicely with the sides in this war . you can't really say it loud , but not many republicans will cry if biden shows himself incompetent at handling the war ."
1557,this a joke ? this sub is literally the donald 3.0
1558,"how embarrassing the attempt of this russian-ukraine war have been , despite the tens of thousands of civilians they have murdered , the story is the same , russia is failing to take a globally supported country back , which now i understand is that ukrainians prior to the fall of the ussr were the brains of the communist power ."
1559,hwen would that have been ? 2008 ?
1560,"everybody has forgotten how long it took to invade iraq . and iraq was a smaller country with a weaker military , they'd been starved out for years by sanctions , and had no outside help . also the us and its allies first carpet bombed the country like psychopaths . remember shock and awe ? the war in ukraine is nothing like that . the russian military is doing about as well as anyone can reasonably expect . their initial blitzkrieg failed to knock ukraine out early . but everything they've done since then has been pretty much perfect ."
1561,"> if russia was the power they claimed to be , they should've rolled over ukraine before a single bullet of foreign aid made it there . most countries are not iraq . there is absolutely no reason to expect that ukraine will just roll over like an arab country . it is only in the middle east that you find armies like the saudis that can't beat the houthis and iraq that can't beat isis . real wars against medium sized countries are tough , like russia is finding out in ukraine right now . the us picked iraq to advertise its new military advances after getting its ass kicked in vietnam and korea . if russia invaded saudi arabia and the us didn't send troops to intervene , they would steam roll the saudis too ."
1562,"what are you on about ? us took iraq over night ? afghanistan ? makes no sense , you people are armchair generals thinking ghost of kyiv is out there assassinating 50 russian generals every day . propaganda really got you good"
1563,"with claims of putin having trump under his thumb , you think he would have invaded before 2020 , especially with ukraine still reeling from annexation of crimea , overall corruption , and covid going on ."
1564,it took the taliban 20 years to fuck up the supposedly best army in the world...and they did it . with 50 year old kalashnikovs while making sweet love to some goats .
1565,how powerful america was compared to vietnam and we know what happened thete .
1566,"dont call me a comrade , it sounds too commie"
1567,"this is a very interesting and novel thought ! youre absolutely right ! russians just do not want to achieve their objectives quickly and efficiently . otherwise , everyone would realize how great and strong russia is and want to move there . and then russians would have to share putins love and caring with all those americans and europeans . but putin's praise may befall upon you one day . just keep sharing your thoughts with everyone . don't overthink it ."
1568,"if russia went all out , thered barely be a world but there certainly wouldnt be a russia"
1569,"it does make me wonder if putin is purposely prolonging the war , w the real goal of destroying the western economies . so far hes winning on that front . edit : lmfao we are getting downvoted for this ."
1570,do please elaborate . are you just talking about nukes ? or are you suggesting that putin isnt using his full military might ( with the exception of nukes )? edit : clarify question
1571,correct
1572,"i dunno . the ukrainians literally went through a revolution where they overthrew a putin puppet 8 years ago . i'm sure they were building their defenses during that time but i'm not sure how far they could have gotten , unless the us was assisting them the whole time . definitely possible ."
1573,the argument may have been made elsewhere but perun lays it out quite well
1574,"iraq yes , afghanistan , no . even at their strongest the us didnt hold much apart from kabul and 1 or 2 other cities . mate you probably wouldnt want to hear this but russia had a better track record in afghanistan than the us . russian trained forces held out for 10 + years in some cases , loooong after the russians had evacuated ."
1575,"that is not even true . having lived there , what you wrote is laughable . even from crimea aspect"
1576,"> the us had no issues taking over iraq and afghanistan in days pretty much yeah bombing ** anything ** that has a smidge ( of questionable ) intelligence will win you a country in days . russia is not trying to play colonizer with countries halfway across the world , so they used a different approach . > russia could barely take control of 1 or 2 cities have you even been paying attention to the news ? ukraine can ** not ** hold the donbass region . edit : reply to comment , ignorant statement . the us is terribly scary when it involves their military ."
1577,dang straight afg was a different animal . back in early 2000s afg people thought we were the russians . thats how out of touch and disconnected many portions of the country are . we tried to go in an build it up and show that the us was a force for good while dealing with an insurgency in a politically correct way .
1578,"winning isn't the point , i don't think ... i think the point is pressures to sway economic power via price manipulation"
1579,its a rag
1580,"russia only committed around 100k troops to ukraine though , out of a total military of 1 million . the rest are kept in reserve in case nato tries something ."
1581,in march everyone was laughing about troops eating expired mres . in april we were told russia's supplies would be depleted by the end of the month . in may they were told they're relying on soviet-era weapons . i'm starting to see a pattern .
1582,"thats just not true , ukraine even said its ran out of its own weapons and is relying on foreign aid while russia has been mainly using shitty soviet era weapons , youve literally got it reversed"
1583,it is according to what source ? nyt claimed russian forces will starve first 10 days of war
1584,"its not about conquering ukraine , its about establishing the nwo . they will deplete our resources and resolve , while getting the general populace psychologically prepared for the next world war . they will continue to dismantle the us from the inside out , and china will take a more open position supporting russia , including munitions . the proxy war will become the world war ."
1585,"agree 100 %. this is an international nightmare for the west . and i fear countries like the us cant see beyond its nose , while china has been the most successful strategy wise of the last 30 years ."
1586,the us military by design is capable of fighting a 2 front war since the mid-90s thanks to pnac . ( i cant believe i said that ).
1587,but i dont think russia cares much about winning the actual physical war . its a dog backed into the corner . its basically a standoff of who gives up first . can russia continue to throw troops at ukraine or can us and europe societies continue to weather high gas and food prices ? sanctions were placed and yet russias oil revenues soared last month while cost of fertilizer and gas goes up elsewhere . can the middle and lower classes continue to pay higher prices for food ? is it worth it to drive to work anymore ? also i believe the threat of china invading is null . why would they do that ? seems expensive when you can just set up better trade pacts . cheaper fertilizer and oil production from russia .
1588,"russia mass produced weapons during ww2 . weve been seeing them recently roll out more modern gear , but started off with soviet era gear . why use the new shit right away ?"
1589,"how is this propaganda ? oil pipelines between germany and russia were turned off . oil prices and inflation increased substantially which led to social unrest in germany . now germany is turning their coal plants back on . which by the way , they buy most of their coal from russia . who is the victor in that one ?"
1590,the propaganda is thinking this is a one-sided victory for the west when for the most part russia is taking over a critical eastern european country unopposed by anything but the us throwing its worthless dollars at it .
1591,"i mean you are seeing it in germany right now . oil pipelines cut off , high gas prices , political unrest . now germany is turning coal plants back on when they buy most of their coal from russia . i dont want russian control either , but this is a wake up call they we need to seriously increase green initiative . we arent there yet and we are suffering ."
1592,"whether you like it or not , eu is likely to rely on russian gas for up to 30 years bcs 1 . it is cheap 2 . gas supply infrastructures are optimized for importing russian gas . [ ex ) ger don't have enough regasfication plant required for importing lng from middle east .] it takes quite a long time to rebuild all those infrastructures . 3 . even if everything goes according to the timeline , eu will have to wait for another 30 years to reach net-zero status . until then , they would still consume tons of fossil fuels to maintain their economy . 4 . most importantly , russian gas replacement plan will cause a unacceptably high rate of inflation that will have a critical impact ( for ruling parties ) on election . for more details , please refer to following news article ."
1593,"well , the energy ' price ' is obviously booming in eu"
1594,i press the button
1595,my favorite objective was the bombing of the mall
1596,don't forget their objective of crossing a river that cost them a battalion .
1597,"oof , as an american , this hits home . watching the eu and japan flounder , and seeing the us economy weaken , youre point is very very valid ."
1598,"> russia's winning strategy is to take a bit of land , quickly run out of supplies , squat down waiting for their failing logistics to amass capacity for a larger offensive that never comes , then their enemy goes bankrupt trying to dislodge them and they declare victory . what's hilarious is that this has never failed them so far . sounds like it works for them ."
1599,"remember the brave paratroopers dropped just outside of kyiv to hold the airfield comrade ?! eh ?! those capitalist pigs will finally pay , wh comrade ?! eh ?! whats that?theyre all dead or captured because they were cut off from support due to terrible mission planning and fundamental failures in mission execution?yayyyy capitlismmmmm"
1600,""" props to trying to stand by russia "" as opposed to what ? standing by the united states ? or nato ? you're standing up for those morally depraved entities ?"
1601,they're taking territory . europe is begging for oil and gas and their leaders know they will have to submit before winter . they are destroying ukrainian infrastructure slowly and methodically . eventually ukrainian morale will break . it will be proof to the world that the dollar is not almighty .
1602,chicken hawks would never . theyll send my ass
1603,"imagine thinking dt is the only politician to advocate for a cease fire , negotiation and agreement . while i agree with the rest of this post , the trump rot here is pretty narrow minded .."
1604,ask jeeves to kick that ass in about 72 hours maybe 
1605,"thank you for this information . i found it both interesting and hard to read on mobile . i notice an upward curve for nearly all nations , especially since the pandemic . well , yeah . i am unsure what point you wanted to make , but i will offer some observations . the nations i mentioned pursuing nuclear weapons are certainly not among the most desperately poor , so there are also other causes contributing to chronic poverty . there is currently an article in subreddit economy from atlantic on russia's contemporary economic condition , not great . not sure if i can figure out how to send it to you , but if you are interested you can probably find it ."
1606,you some kindamearsheimer reader or something ?
1607,6 months to get 1/3 of ukraine is hardly a success for a super power . especially the cost of all of the hardware and souls lost .
1608,who
1609,"> the fact that russia relied on ukraine ukraine has been always been a vital part of ussr&russia . ussr would be about half of what it was if it wasnt for ukraine and its people . even in 2014 russia was still buying military engines that are made in ukraine . ukraine has been extremely vital in their engineering , science and manufacturing ."
1610,"not quite right . we can also do 65 nm , but very hard and not in very large quantities ."
1611,"imagine how power-hungry and hot those things have to be getting . and probably no thermal throttling either , so they're gonna be blowing processors if they try to make them do anything more than a basic graphing calculator ."
1612,"concerning semiconductor manufacturing and a lot of stuff in the modern world of science and engineering , being capable of 2000s tech is on par with not being capable of any production capacity , it being so outdated ."
1613,> they defaulted on their loans because the banks wouldnt allow them to pay iirc . didn't allow or did russia not have an acceptable form of currency ? there's a difference .
1614,the peoples ' vassal states of the chinese communist party . lol
1615,"i'm sure the country will still be russia , but given the trend , putin will probably be taken out by someone internally , and historically speaking , someone with a mustache will step in . not even joking , there's a running history in russian politics where every other leader has a mustache ."
1616,"unless ukrainians combine with a revolution in russia and take moscow . what then ? if zelensky became the president of a new russia , absorbing ukraine and belarus , with friendly ties to the eu and possible membership in nato ? take that , uno reverse"
1617,"you dont need semi conductors or all these fancy science infrastructure to be a strong nation . all you need is raw materials and a good education system . russia will just trade with china and india and all the other countries that dont care about the us sanctions . leaving america to scramble for raw materials in south america or worse yet , mine them themselves ."
1618,hard truth .
1619,"i know more than you , kid . know your place ."
1620,"where are all these resources now ? if they have all this , why are they struggling with ukraine ?"
1621,"outsourcing . they made basically everything they use by either blatantly copying everyone else's crap , or just buying it from other people . they don't innovate , they don't actually make anything . hell , even tetris was made on a knockoff of the lsi-11 . even russia's shuttle program was a blatant knockoff , and though they had lofty ideas , it never actually worked . as for their submarines , go talk to the kursk about how that went for them . or the k-19 . or the k27 . or the k8 . or the k219 . or the k278 . or the k429 . or the k159 . or maybe you'd prefer their aircraft carrier , which is so poorly constructed and maintained that the ship can't even move under its own power , nevermind the fact that they stole the boat in the first place because they couldn't manage to build their own . in fact , it was such a shitshow that russia couldn't even finish building the second one , and just sold it to china so they could finish it and turn it into a floating casino . also your assessment of boeing is bullshit . boeing is notoriously anti-foreign . so how about you get on your little sputnik pedalbike and pedal on home to putin and let him know your shitty propaganda attempts have failed ."
1622,what ever you say putin 
1623,"even though there are notable areas of achievement , russia , overall , is a country fraught with corruption - being behind many of its peers scientifically and economically , and despite its natural resource and supposed military strength , has shown numerous economic and military deficiencies in its recent war with ukraine and generally is underperforming in these fronts"
1624,"keep telling yourself that . russia's most advanced tank to date is just a really , really underpowered reskin of their t72 . which was made 50 years ago . they have exactly one aircraft carrier(which they stole ), and the thing doesn't even move on its own , their planes are crap , and very recently , one of their most advanced planes got shot down . and the guidance system was still perfectly intact . which means that ukraine and by extension the us know exactly what frequency their most advanced planes broadcast their missile guidance and targeting radar on . which means we can set up a quick triad of antennae and receivers tuned to that frequency and be able to know the exact position and altitude of every single one of russia's , again , i feel this is important to remind you , most advanced fighter jet . which is to say nothing of the fact that russia's got no way to build anything new ."
1625,"yes , appear to look weak by sending your military to die and make the war as unpopular as possible within your own country"
1626,"look at how their generals are living . large ornate palacial homes , fancy cars , etc . corruption killed the russian war machine , and years of negligence let it stay dead ."

1629,"i mean ... no ? not even remotely ? america's been producing newer and newer weapon systems every day , france is constantly researching and developing new crap , and intercept systems have been steadily researched as strongly as possible all throughout the last few decades , which have made the era of the icbm completely obsolete . go look up the maps system that america just rolled out . or the laser intercept system israel's been developing . or japan's mitsubishi f3 , on track to become one of the most advanced stealth fighter jets ever produced , with a missile intercept system that uses microwaves rather than traditional chaff or flares , and that can control its own wing of drones . yeah . one pilot , one plane , several actual fighters . countries all over the world put a lot of effort into developing new and improved systems every day for their armies . the countries who don't get steamrolled pretty damn quick . the countries who do ? get to take advantage of all the tech they develop for the military in the civilian sector . which is why you can now buy a functional and relatively high quality night vision goggle set from your local big box store in the toy aisle , and why your phone has about six different map apps that can figure out your position based on where you're standing on the planet . to say nothing of ... you know ... everything nasa developed , a branch of government that i feel i should remind you was established to demonstrate high-ground capability during the cold war by showing that we could put a payload higher up and further out than the russians could , and have it land reliably wherever we wanted it to . your smartphone has several dozen technologies developed through military advancement built into it right now . the digital camera sensor , gps navigation , photosensor amplification systems for low light photography , any number of other things . cellulose bandages ? developed by the military . you know them now as sanitary napkins , or , if you're a yank , "" pads "" for periods . ever used a flir camera to see thermal images ? military spending . most of the sensors in your fitbit ? military spending . software designed radios , as used by police radio scanners , ems , fire , radio astronomy , etc ? military spending . and on the most cutting edge side of things ? exoskeletal walking suits for rehabilitation of patients in hospitals . also no military spending means drones wouldn't exist . which would mean that filmmakers would have to go back to chartering expensive helicopter flights to get those big establishing shots from the air they used to . just because you don't hear about the new developments every day doesn't mean they aren't happening . the big arms race up to about three years ago was exoatmospheric intercept technology . shooting down hypersonic exoatmospheric ballistic-trajectory objects . panicky people said satellites , but anyone paying attention knew this was about targeting icbms ."

1637,"you are ignoring the feat of mobilization that was moving shit from the u.s . to iraq . thats half the world away , while russia got quagmired with their neighbor . thats not nothing ."
1638,"what ? you cant be fucking serious ? so let me get this straight , from a purely military perspective : getting tied up at a river crossing you had to setup pontoon bridges to cross because all of the critical bridges in the area were destroyed , and consequently having concentrated fire keyed in your location by an inferior force , resulting in the destruction of not just the bridge , but men and machinery , is your definition of perfect in any fucking sense of the word ???? this is just one example there comrade"
1639,uhthe americans and british toppled the iraqi government in less than 6 weeks . the iraqi army literally gave up . not sure where you get your history from ?
1640,"they're gaining and not losing any ground , except they got pushed out of kharkiv and are losing ground around kherson as fast as they are gaining . this whole thing is more inaccurate than everything that the russian politician accounts post lol ."

1647,"yeah , nukes , tsar bomb , etc etc . he obviously wants cities intact and to not be attacked by the biggest members of nato and the un ."
1648,agree .. and ukraine isn't exactly known for being a shining example on shunning corruption either . i just thought it neat that they may not have been as big of an underdog as reported .
1649,that was the exact one i was thinking about . thanks !!
1650,lmao i was in afghanistan . russia left their mark everywhere with their failures .
1651,well at least we dont bomb women & children
1652,"yall were literally supporting a govt . that looked the other way during bacha bazi ( american and nato countries found another market for cotton in afghanistan . flooded the market , tanked the price and the afghani farmers then had to grow opium .

1653,if their plan was to not win then they have mastered that strategy . was toilet theft part of the master plan as well ?
1654,"it is not at all impressive , actually . they have shown time and time again to be largely incompetent compared to nato forces . what russian was projecting their capabilities to be , pre-war , shouldve resulted in a similar outcome of the 2003 invasion of iraq . largely over in a matter of weeks , yet here we are months later . their equipment ( or in some cases lack there of ) has been revealed to be largely outdated and under maintained and have yet to even achieve air superiority ."
1655,"yes , and in february everyone said ukraine would get steamrolled by a military behemoth a special military operation that has become the largest conflict in europe since 1945 ."
1656,"but ukraine havent ran out , because theyre being supplied by the west and will continue to be supplied and trained by the west for a long time . russia wont be able to withstand a war of attrition in the same way ukraine can . even if they conquered the country they wouldnt be able to hold onto it due to partisan attacks - they simply dont have enough men ."
1657,* current rate * - this past month theyve added approx 0.5 % of territory .

1659,"> they're also not trying to take over all of ukraine they said they just want the areas that they pretty much now control . no , russia said they want to demilitarize ukraine . i don't think they are going to leave a western ukraine around to join nato ."
1660,this isn't the 90s anymore . russia isn't the broken country that it was and china is way more powerful than 20 years ago .
1661,"i cant believe i have to say this , but do we really want that ? the way wars are fought nowadays arent the same as our history textbooks . super power countries just throw money at a never ending war now . i fear a two front war would break the us ."
1662,"you don't fight wars for shits and giggles , you fight wars for resources . look at every war and behind it is a war for resources . the resource russia needs is the black sea . both from an economic and military standpoint , they need access to this waterway . hence their invasion of crimea . ukraine was a puppet state for a period of time , and therefore putin was ok with it being independent . however , when the puppet government was thrown out it created a more hostile relationship with putin . inflation isn't the direct result of russia's war with ukraine , it's a small factor in inflation . the bigger factor of inflation is the pandemic . for two , almost three years , the economy around the world coped with less production and falling or stagnant prices due to low demand . all of a sudden not only are we back to work but the cost of everything has substantially increased because demand , around the world , has increased . look at the jobs market in the us . we had the worst unemployment in us history since the great depression , we now have the lowest unemployment in the post-war ( wwii ) era , yet month after month we are still creating jobs on top of the jobs we can't fill . for 2-3 years companies and corporations made do with fewer workers than necessary because they didn't have the business , and when demand required workers , they couldn't get them fast enough . not because they were slow on the draw , not because they aren't necessarily paying them a living wage ( some aren't still ), but because demand for workers increased in a very short period of time , making the cost of a new employee higher , making the cost of goods higher , creating inflation . then you have gas . gasoline/petrol is a whole other issue . in the early 2000's left and right you had oil/petrol refineries having major fires . instead of rebuilding those refineries and maintaining production output across several refineries rather than relying on a few , oil refining companies didn't rebuild those refineries . in addition , they closed down some . in doing so , they kept prices artificially high , while maintaining production . however , since then , anytime we have a production issue , such as the fire in a southern refinery , prices skyrocket , and supplies disappear . our issue is not the supply of oil , yes , the price of oil has increased , our issue is the ability to refine the oil . this is why when we released oil from the national reserves , it made no dent in the price of oil or gas . we can flood the market with oil , but it needs to be refined and the refining capability is constrained . which is why europe , mainly germany , relies on russian oil . they aren't getting crude oil from russia . they get refined products from russia via pipeline . that pipeline literally comes from the russian refinery . the challenge for any country that relies upon another country for its refining capability . you can purchase all the oil you want , what do you do with it once you purchase it ? if you don't have the capability to refine it , you need to find a country that can . "" more oil "", just like "" more guns "", is not the solution to the problem ."
1663,"russia is very much winning the war in ukraine . they didn't lose even 5 % of their forces , and they are advancing every single day . they never intended to "" blitz "", it was naive to assume so , and are being careful to reduce damage to civillian infrastructure and population . to them , this is not a battle in a foreign land with a foreign people , they are there to stay , and are selling it as "" liberation "". they can't rush without causing massive damage & loss of life , and without also suffering huge casualties thselves , so they are slowly and methodically taking one small area at a time . they can't build up a fleet in the black sea for a naval invasion , they can't achieve total air superiority due to ukrainian s300 systems being fed info by nato radars and satelites , and they can't bomb ukraine to oblivion because there goes the whole "" liberation "" story . so they are taking it slow . but make no mistake , this is still one of the biggest , most heavily armed , and increasingly among the most experienced armies in the world , with no intention of stopping before the entire donbass and beyond are firmly in russia's hands ."
1664,"russia destroying its relations with the west is going to embolden china to go full out building up its navy and air force to take on the us in the pacific . this actually makes russia safer from china in the long run , because the chinese army will be far smaller and less capable if china is putting all its defense money into new aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines ."
1665,"i'm sorry , what ? you think russia was fighting this war with wwii era weapons ? soviet era i'll give you , but that's the problem . russian weapons development is more theory than practice . the t-14 hasn't yet been mass produced because the weapons system is so expensive . the t-90s they had were obliterated by drones so they went back to t-72s , which were likewise obliterated . they've lost two ships in the black sea to drones , both being two of the most modern warships the russians have in their navy ! you don't protract a war if you can afford not to , and if you have the weapons to bring a war to an end quickly you use them because otherwise the cost outweighs the benefit of the war in terms of money , men , and machines . they are literally taking stuff out of mothballs in order to fight this war ."

1678,"very true , lots of intellectuals fled russia ( because they werent stupid ) and realized ukraine was a beautiful up and coming free society this was another reason to invade , not only natural resources but it looks bad to have a country like ukraine in the up and coming while you still remain a fascist dictatorship ."
1679,"shit currency , putin said tho , "" we're still taking and paying in rubles if you want gas. and the collective world over said , "" pay us in our currencies or we'll go self-sustaining ."" he got mad and went quiet , then got all his shit defaulted either way ."
1680,theres absolutely a difference . im just highlighting its not because they didnt have the money . its because putin sucks and they need to get out of ukraine .
1681,"they had an acceptable form of currency but we decided to freeze their accounts and refuse payment . the "" default "" was forced upon them for political reasons , it's hardly a real default ."

1685,"not having the capability to be self sustaining in key areas of national defense and scientific advancement makes them over reliant on natural resource wealth . then , theyll be dependent on other countries for things like semiconductors , modern culture , medicine , engineering , data , and foreign businesses for employment . sure , countries that have that stuff may experience resource shortages when they cut off russian trade , but they have the know how and power to look somewhere else . russia is then stuck seeking fewer markets , like china or india . china , seeing that russia has become highly reliant on them for trade , can now dictate terms on an uneven playing field . in general , nations that are more technologically advanced and dynamic tend to be the ones who have the power to choose how their economies will grow ."
1686,check your ego and go back to your manga . kid .
1687,trying to sound smart and tough but you forgot we can look at your post history lmfao .
1688,"why did america struggle with vietnam , iraq , and afghanistan ?"
1689,"well for starters , russia is trying to fight a war inside of ukraine and not on their own land . secondly , the entire world essentially throwing sanctions at russia and refusing to do business with them . ukraine on the other hand has an essentially endless supply of money and supplies from the us to keep them fighting for longer . it's not a fair fight in the slightest . not defending russia , but it's not really a comparable situation between the two countries ."
1690,"because ukraine is one of the biggest countries in europe ? i don't know why people think conquering ukraine should be a cake walk . do you know why the us only picks on weak countries like iraq or afghanistan ? it is because the us tried to fight wars in korea and vietnam , those didn't turn out well . it turns out that fighting even medium sized countries is really hard . the us only managed to fight to a draw in the korean war , and that is with 22 other countries contributing troops . in 1950 , the us was undisputably the biggest industrial and military power on earth . yet its troops got surrounded in north korea and were forced to flee . the record for the longest retreat in us army history was set in the aftermath of the battle of chosin reservoir . the korean war was such an embarrassment to the us that it is regarded as the forgotten war in the us . in short , war is hard . some military setbacks against a medium sized power like ukraine is expected . it doesn't say anything about russia as a major power ."
1691,was waiting for you to mention the aircraft carrier that they struggle to keep floating lol
1692,"when you say most advanced fighter jet , do you mean that they had a single one of that jet , or that the class of jets of the one that got shot down is their most advanced one ? just asking for clarification ; as it seems absurd theyd have only one of an advanced jet"
1693,"i agree with all of this except that their planes are crap . some are crap like the su24 , mig29 , tu95..etc but others are some of the best in the world su30 , tu160 , su35 , su34 , mig 31 , su57 . read up about the 3rd generation mig 25 shooting down a 4th gen f15 and giving them all they could handle in the gulf war ."
1694,we shall see . remember western media rarely tell us the truth .
1695,"eh , no : "" moscow also wants to pay , to avoid getting lumped in with the poor and chaotically governed nations which typically default . but a welter of sanctions by the united states and the european union prevent it from sending money through the global payments system . an exemption that allowed u.s . owners of russian sovereign bonds to receive payments has now expired . that is pushing russia towards default by blocking the path by which payments would reach bondholders ' bank accounts ."" source :"
1696,"usa choosed to be in a "" permanent state of war production "" since eisenhower , that's not what usually countries do . this changed the course of usa foreign politics and economy . america is a junkie who needs war , on a certain pov . not sure tho about this "" distortion "" leading to better army and strategic benefits , definitely leaded to bribe scandals like the lockheed martin ones . anyway , the war paradygm worked somehow well until the early 2000's , now i doubt ."
1697,damn bro ur right im such a failure says someone with zero empirical evidence of whats going on . keep regurgitating cnn headlines bud . i wish you a speedy recovery from whatever mental condition youre suffering edit : spelling
1698,"let's not forget democracy , it's the 1 exporter for that . i was referring to energy , btw ."
1699,"> no one forced them to do it relations between russia and america had already greatly deteriorated under obama , us took part in financing the ukrainian regime change and coup in 2014 . us got very angry when russia stepped in the invasion and regime change in siria . other minor "" revolutions "" no one even talked about took place around russia in the last years and the us are involved . after the regime change in ukraine the us entered in the ukrainian economy controlling important companies ( hunter biden having "" by coincidence "" a company there proves that ). so yes , no one * forced * russians to invade ukraine . russians not doing anything about the inapposite ukrainian nato membership would have just reduced their nuclear deterrent capability . this would have led to less and less deterrence throughout the western part . and when you lost nuclear detterrent you can certainly trust that americans won't attack you with some pathetic false flag after 3 , 5 , 10 years ."
1700,but we dont 
1701,"ukraine was just escorting civilian non-combatants out of the regions , russia is losing hundreds of armored vehicles and tanks every day along with the personnel inside them . the ground russia is destroying includes residential areas , commerce shops , malls , churches and schools , thousands of civilians are put in risk because of the back slighted murderous intent to kill people who aren't prepared to fight back - yet the ukrainian military is able to destoy the continued assaults from the weak willed enslaved russian fighters ."
1702,"yes that is one example you've cherry picked . the truth is they are gaining territory and show no signs of losing any . meanwhile , on the proxy war front , they have overcome the economic sanctions and now it appears that these sanctions are in fact hurting nato more than they are hurting russia . russia is selling its oil to india and china , meanwhile everyone knows that europe cannot last through this winter without russian oil and gas ."
1703,"they're winning pretty much everywhere , gaining territory in all their target areas and barely taking any casualties . the first weeks were chaotic , just like in any war . because no plan survives contact with the enemy . but it's been completely one sided for a while now . please stop believing the nonsense the government and media are saying . it's a war , they're lying . look at the maps . look at the casualty figures ."
1704,"yeah , the iraqi army gave up and it still took ages . russia didn't carpet bomb the country , the army didn't collapse from the initial blitzkrieg and they have outside help . so the russians have changed tactics . right now they're barely losing any soldiers . they're steadily taking territory in all the areas they're concentrating on . and they're pinning down the ukrainians everywhere else . everyone who knows anything about military shit can see that this is an almost flawless performance . the people on tv are fucking lying to you . mainstream media and watching too many action films are rotting people's brains ."
1705,"explain trump in helsinki . look again at the pictures of him cowering in shame and fear , somehow appearing the same height as the much shorter russian butcher ."
1706,you should respect how people choose to self-identify .
1707,"you just sound like a red , thats all"
1708,youre not wrong .
1709,"im not sure well ever know . option 1 is what you said . he tried to use military force and miscalculated ukraine , but then realized the side benefit of dragging out the war . option 2 is that economic warfare has been the plan the entire time , under the guise of taking ukraine . i lean towards option 2 , but have no way to prove either . i thought it was interesting that a ) he kept saying everything was going according to plan when they were stuck in kiev ( altho thats what any russian leader wouldve said over the years anyway ), and b ) hes been pretty chill about finland and sweden joining nato ( so long as we dont amass forces at the borders ). i would think that if this was solely about ukraine and border control , then he wouldve been more upset about finland/sweden . but i have very little to go off of . either way , i think american media under represents the cost of the war . yes , russias military is doing a terrible job in ukraine . but they are really effing up the western economies ! the eu is really scary right now ."
1710,yea didnt the usa send in like a few navy seals & they did what the entire russian army could not do !!
1711,"you realize us was assisted by uk , aus , multiple european countrys ? or are you just having a selective memory ? a month with assistance from their worldwide genociders , ontop of trillions spent and thousands of casualties . on top of that , after 20 years they still died to civilian resistors and couldn't stop the inevitable isis which followed . how pathetic"
1712,russia still thinks it can win and regain its place on the world stage at some point so is fighting tactically . if putin decides they're going to be shunned for eternity after this he'll just carpet bomb the whole country . they could've taken kiev a long time ago if they didn't care about casualties .
1713,maybe russia's goal is not to take over all of ukraine ...
1714,what years were you active in the peace corp ? you seem like the type of person who only works to better the world .
1715,the ruble is at ath's m8 think about it
1716,"the iraq war was fought against poorly equipped insurgents , not a formal state military funded out the teeth by an alliance of nations including the worlds largest superpower to the tune of nearly $ 60 billion . not even a comparison ."
1717,you do realize how badly ukraine was losing when kyiv was attacked right ? poor logistics is what fucked up the start of the invasion and the only reason they didnt secure the capitol . had that convoy made it to them ukraine would have been done for .
1718,> russia wont be able to withstand a war of attrition in the same way ukraine can i actually think it is ukraine that can't win a war of attrition . but of course this is where opinions differ and differences have to be settled on the battlefield .
1719,"that is a bad way to quantify how things are going . taking a large city could be 0.1 % of the territory , but it is very hard to accomplish . doing it by population might be a better metric ."
1720,""" current rate of conquest "" its scary how hard people try to believe others are stupid to feel smart . like you cant actually believe he cant divide 304 its just such a cheap way to feel better about yourself"
1721,da fuq they absolutely intended to blitz . the tried taking kyiv in the first few days . lost that battle and then moved goal posts saying it was never their intention . every thing you listed is a failure in military terms for russia . they have already taken extremely heavy loses and cant even maintain encrypted coms . their fighters are relying on on maps and personal gos for navigation . they are a joke of a military and have already dug into their cold war reserves . literally sending t-62s into the fight . they were exposed to be a paper bear . cope as much as you want but the russian military is far from being on par with the major players of nato .
1722,does it matter if you have the newest weapons anymore ? the us had the newest weapons in the middle east and we basically lost that one or had no intention of winning ( whichever way you see it ).
1723,"agree , but we need to strengthen our green initiatives . right now we arent there . and we are seriously feeling it ."
1724,are you that much of an asshole to think that the people who work those kinds of jobs dont matter ?
1725,"you are looking at this event from non-economical point of view , while i'm looking at it from economical point of view . that is the difference between us . but this is a subreddit about economics , so you know which point of view should be used here . right ?"
1726,nah you guys forgot about the airport they failed to hold successfully like 18 different times
1727,"i'm not a russian . and no , we're going to lose . we're going to lose because we are a weak empire in decay . we are a weak empire that has allowed military contractors and oligarchs to corrupt and plunder from our society . we've cut our own dick off , wiped dick blood on our face , and are yelling at the sky how we are winning . it is pathetic ."
1728,"no you won't . you're going to pretend like you knew russia was going to win all along . that's what people like you always do . and then you'll go ahead and cheerlead for the next war the united states gets involved in . again , that's what people like you always do ."
1729,guessing most were never enlisted as well . always sounds like a big dick idea to drop boots on another country when it ain't your boots that are going to get blown the fuck up .
1730,lets be perfectly honest : would or should anyone trust a single fucking word any ukrainian government official said anyway ?
1731,definitely trolling russian .
1732,these intellectuals didnt stay in ukraine . the per capita income is less than $ 2500 . i feel like everyone talking about ukraine doesnt know the current state their in .
1733,"definitely , this is the real basis for the invasion . it had very little to do with nato or any military issues at all ."
1734,"ukraine has a gdp per capita of $ 3k a year pre invasion . it is the most corrupt nation in europe , all these redditors are delusional . russia has basically decimated the ukrainian army in the donbas , theres practically no chance to reverse the tide in the donbas"
1735,"> very true , lots of intellectuals fled russia ( because they werent stupid ) and realized ukraine was a beautiful up and coming free society it was a two way movement , many russian scientists , engineers , poets , singers came from ukraine during early ussr they literally had gulags([called sharashka ]( for scientists that were poached from ukraine ..... because "" reasons """
1736,"ukraine has had some sketchy stuff going on since 2014 . they do not fall into the category of "" up and coming free society ."""
1737,"i mean acceptable form of currency and not having money are very similar . if i have 100 btc but can't spend them the places i want , it's basically worthless . sure i have currency but it's equivalent to not having money . if nobody accepts your currency , you really don't have money . it's not a super hard logical leap . just pointing that out ."
1738,"that is not true if you check the human history . greeks were highly developed , same for rome empire and the egypts . there is only very very things which counts in order for a nation ( human beings ) to survive - food - water - energy ( to produce food and water ) you have to realize that everything else depends on these items . you cannot build any technology if you cannot feed your people . if you followed the revolutionary movements in north africa - which all started in tunesia - check the price of bread . just a little experiment for you : check the number of crazy and emotional people who run to the supermarkets if monday is a bank holiday . they literally think they will starve . so as long as you have food ( and thats what we had/have the last 50 years and we take it for granted ) people just think the main point of live is to have the most updated version of an iphone . people have time to think and invent the moment where these things are gone or expensive , good night lets see how europe will go down the drain in 6 months when they realized that their ideology made europe commit suicide . i mean its just my personal opinion and i would be more than happy if i am wrong . but history shows thats its always about - food - water"
1739,"exactly , people are so naive and dumb when it comes to this subject ."
1740,"the answer to your question could fill a library . but the short answer is we didnt , we won every tactical and strategic battle , but you cant occupy a country where a sizable part of the people dont want you there . russia has been caught to a stalemate by a country with a significantly smaller , less equipped army . even if they somehow win some part of ukraine ( all of ukraine is an impossibility ) they will be fighting an insurgency for 20 years . . it will be bleed russia dry . the best thing would be for russia to lose quickly , maybe with some artificial empathy the world treats them like a normal country ."
1741,we took over iraq twice . there were . insurgents but not enough to not secure land .
1742,"because the united states was fighting basically decentralized guerrilla insurgency armies using fabian tactics that the united states itself indirectly made or spawned itself . in countries that didnt have much of a state structure or coherent governmental institutions at the time of the fighting . whereas russia is an actual organized state with a centralized professional military , sorta . big difference"
1743,"struggle ? what struggle ? within a week the united states destroyed the iraqi army , the only thing left were insurgencies . theres still ukrainian military conducting military operations . they have sam sites , they have jets , iraq had none of that in less than a week ."
1744,"the us never lost a single tank in iraq-afghanistan . i should probably qualify that by saying to the enemy . i actually heard a story that we lost one due to a crew driving it off a cliff basically . then , that we had to guard it while they let they burned the inside with a special fuel so none of it would fall in enemy hands ."
1745,"because n matter what , no matter how much we take over and the same applies to russia theres always,always going to be that one guy with a rifle ."
1746,"good point . i would argue though that russia suffered much more losses within just few months , compared to us in afghanistan ."
1747,well vietcong were aided by ussr and china and mostly faught guerrilla style warfare against us like taliban . in conventional warfare us kicked their ass but that wasnt the point .
1748,""" not their own land "", it is f'king next door , there is no way this doesn't look pathetic and weak ( no matter how many time putin takes off his shirt .) sorry no way to make this look good .."
1749,"what the fuck are you talking about ? youre arguing against a point i didnt make . why are you dragging the us into this ? why complain that ukraine is large and then mention afghanistan which is larger ? i just .. dont understand what point youre trying to make , is it russia strong ? cause theyve prooven in the last 4 months that they arent ."
1750,"the f15 was fielded in 1976 . seriously , the eagle's been around for 45 years , taking one of those down isn't that impressive . as for everything else russia is putting in the air , russia's achilles heel across the board is electronics . they have no eccm systems to speak of , they barely have chaff , they're constantly getting plucked out of the sky because it doesn't matter how advanced your bird is if the thing can't get away from a sam . so while countries like japan are developing microwave laser based missile intercept systems(leave it to japan to outfit their planes with fuckin ' beam guns ) and drone wings to accompany pilots , russia can put as many of their most advanced fighters in the air as they want , and they'll lose every single one of them because they've got no countermeasure systems that work properly , they're remarkably prone to jamming both in radio and in guidance , and they're honestly kind of a shitshow ."
1751,"given your shitty spelling and your dumbass propaganda , it's pretty clear you're just another russian . go back to moscow ."
1752,""" imperial evidence "" you know , if you're going to try and spread propaganda on english speaking websites , you might want to learn english first . but of course , you're russian , you aren't smart enough to do that ."
1753,"obvi a troll guys , keep scrolling"
1754,"thank you george p . mitchell , our shale gas lord and savior , for turning the u.s . into the largest ng exporter in the world ."
1755,"russia tried to force ukraine to become a puppy state , a revolution happened and they changed leadership . of course after that , they became more inclined towards the west . thats russias own fault . there can never be reasons that justifies attacking a soverign country . if you have a crazy psychopath waving a knife and stabbing his neighbors on the one end and others that made a pact offering protection because of the stabby guy on the other . who are you going to be drawn to ? russia is natos biggest promotor ."
1756,"where did they start mariupol ? that's gone . severodonetsk was next and also gone , now . also they are fighting in the donbass region ( the place where people wanted to secede ), so who is really putting who in risk ."
1757,not to mention it's got all the other oil producers spooked . the sanctions could very well spell the end of the petro dollar and by extension the influence the us has on the rest of the world . countries are thinking twice whether they want a large portion of their reserves in $$ right now .
1758,from where can we find the true numbers ?
1759,"hey russian sympathizer , go f yourself ."
1760,"whoa ! we shouldnt trust the media and the government ? mind blowing . we will trust you form now on . please share those figures and maps youre referring to . we all would love you to open our sheeple minds , oh mister military expert , the keeper of truth ."
1761,flawless performance lmao razing entire cities to the ground like in ww2 is the only reason russia is moving . its just not how anyone fights anymore in the civilized era . thats why russia has been shunned . the usa never did that in iraq or afghanistan - i was there .
1762,"you're absolutely right . we're watching the death throes of western hegemony and the western media is acting like the west is strong . it is pathetic , honestly ."
1763,"no need to respond , just check out their post history ."
1764,who should ?
1765,"well i'm not the one who said it , so ... but let's just break this down . a word is not a political system lol . also , you should look into being so scared of communists ."
1766,"putin thought that zelensky would run like yanukovych . when zelensky didn't run , it turned from blitzkrieg into attrition . the media narrative that because the war didn't go according to russia's best plans , that they are losing is also ridiculous though . wars are hard , and don't go according to plan . right now , russia is destroying enough western military hardware in ukraine that it is not only demilitarizing ukraine , it is also demilitarizing nato . multiple nato countries have pretty much run out of their ammunition stockpiles after supplying ukraine ."
1767,"thank you for gracing this subreddit with your unrivaled analysis . i pray oneday i can understand economics as well as you do . the narrow minded might claim that this is a predictable result of having high exports , low imports , and massive economic intervention . but you see through the lies and understand the truth . you know that big number equals good economy ."
1768,im sure that will last
1769,youre confusing iraq & afghanistan . iraq had the 4th or 5th largest military in the world and a considerable number of russian tanks & fighter jets that got obliterated in weeks .
1770,those 60$bln in weapons are not there yet . not even close .
1771,"im sure this has been a great opportunity for defence contractors - if putin had sense he wouldnt have given them the golden opportunity to test out all their new weapons on his armed forces but here we are . its gone too far now , we have to keep going until russia retreats or collapses . id argue for even more pressure , the west should stop withholding and get the job done asap ."
1772,"oh i 100 % accept that it was russian military stupidity which has cost them dearly , just look at hostomel ."
1773,"the current rate is by far the most important measure because its much more representative of the future . they cant launch a surprise invasion with fresh forces twice , but they most likely will fight a grinding attritional war for months on end . how much money would you want to bet that russia takes 15 times more territory this month ( 7.5 %) than they did last month ( 0.5 %)? i doubt youd want to put any money behind that outcome "
1774,"as it happens , sweden and finland joining nato have made the initial objective of forcing nato out largely irrelevant ."
1775,"how do you mean we lost ? the us mission in iraq was to oust saddam hussain and install a democratically elected government . if you consider the cheney doctrine from the first gulf war , we even achieved those goals , with one exception . where the mission in iraq was a failure was that the cheney doctrine believed that if we installed a democracy in the middle east the region would destabilize ( which it did , the arab spring ) and democracy would spread creating favorable relationships with the us ( which did not happen ). isis was a direct result of the cheney doctrine . that said , the 2nd gulf war achieved its mission . it doesn't mean that anyone has to believe that was where the us should have been , i don't personally , but as far as what the mission was and did the us achieve those goals , yes we did . so , having the most sophisticated weapons in both gulf wars meant we achieved our goals quickly ."
1776,true .. just bought a ev and have ordered solar cells . that is a direct reaction to the energy and russian crisis .
1777,"the truth hurts bud , pick up some more shifts lazy fuck ."
1778,"there have been no earnings in sustainable energy compared to now . the energy have been dirt cheap . the inflation and price of oil are determined by demand . of demand goes down , well guess what the price of oil will do . there is plenty of that black shit , even without fascist oil from russia . so - if you invest your money in solar cells instead of paying the 1000 % increase in price pr . kwh , your solar investments roi will be within 5years and you will have quite a decent roi after the 20-25 years durability of the solar cell installation . it people cant even afford to buy , even a modest heatblower , there are a social structual problem , rather than high oil and gas prices . we just paused almost everything for 2 years - dont think that wasnt the biggest cashcow and the energy crises might be cheaper than that one ."
1779,"economic , not economical ."
1780,"oh yes ! and hostomel too , that was one of the greats ."
1781,"always do . that's what you always do . because always do . again , thats what you always do . always ."
1782,"ok , just hand wave and call for more people to be shot and blown up , then you won't have to engage with any substantive issues !"
1783,take in mind that they are comparing against russia and other neighbors .
1784,not now . but ukraine definitely was on the up and coming . hello . some great engineers this is what we were on topic of .
1785,"the last time i tried to pay my electric bill with krankybucks , they laughed at me and had me escorted out of the building"
1786,they had money in their forex accounts . they werent allowed to access their accounts .
1787,"we didn't take over iraq the first time , in a rare burst of wisdom we kept our mission objectives limited and achievable . the next time we took land , however our objective was targeting international terrorism but what we left behind was isis . in afghanistan , the taliban and osama bin laden's al-qaeda were the targets . the taliban remained , however to our credit we did complete the mission to get obl , albeit in a neighboring country ."
1788,"yeah i'm not arguing that it makes russia look good . i'm just saying that ukraine is getting billions in financial support as well as an endless supply of weapons that they didn't have on their own . russia is getting none of that support while also having every developed nation hit them with hard sanctions . we all know russia could wipe ukraine off the map if it was solely about just beating ukraine . i am no fan of russia and think what they are doing is horrible , but i so enjoy having open and free discussions about topics like this ."
1789,"your point is that russia isn't that powerful because it isn't steam rolling ukraine . but the us actually lost major battles in the korean war back in 1950 , and no one would say the us was a weak country because of it . the world calls the us a super power , but it lost wars in much smaller and weaker countries than ukraine . my point is that military set backs are perfectly normal , drawing conclusions about a country's total power from a few military setbacks makes little sense . ukraine isn't just large in terms of territory , it is also industrialized which afghanistan isn't . fighting a medium sized , industrialized country is not easy , and it shouldn't be ."
1790,"i again agree with everything you said except that taking down an f15 isnt that impressive . theyre old air frames today , they werent that old during the gulf war , but theyve been constantly updated . theyre right at the top of the 4th gen platforms with j11d and su35 in air to air and f15e is at the top of air to ground with rafale and fa18 ."
1791,we wont have to worry about him he will still be on the front line being slain by st . javelin
1792,keep seething .
1793,"> revolution happened keke , yes , another coup and * regime change * in 2014 . hunter biden was working there by coincidence ."
1794,"you can't . look at the ukrainian figures , then look at the russian ones . the truth is somewhere in between . but both say that ukraine is losing badly ."
1795,are you a child ? how does pointing out the obvious fact that ukraine is losing make me a sympathiser ?
1796,"no i agree completely , forcing oil dependant nations to pay for their oil in rubles = hi exports low imports = strong ruble"
1797,no way for us to know we arent tracking where theyre going or whos getting them
1798,hostomel was tragic . reinforcments would have so change the tide of that battle so much . either way ukraine will most likely have to cede territory . i dont see them taking back all of ukraine .
1799,304=7.5 u dum or wha ?
1800,couple that with our need for rare earth metals in the fight for space and the coming chip wars with massive silicon deposits in norway while finland and sweden are mostly non extractive in silicon deposits . if the plan was to bring a larger swath of pure land into a unified west and giving up ukraine was a cost of doing business .. the west outmaneuvered putin and will have bases just as close to moscow as when they started . closer if you assume we didnt actually have nato planes in kyiv and will at the tip of finland . and no i didnt read this in western media i just researched what the west gained from this and those two non conflict countries now being smothered with mines and military bases is ultimately a greater win in the grand scheme than ukraine ever was and they didnt have to fire a single shot to get it .
1801,holy shit . i didnt realize their was people actually like this . cope so hard . i guess the an-225 just destroyed itself .
1802,"it sounds like you may be splitting hairs by specifying a battle * in * kyiv . of course the fighting never made it * into * kyiv , that's the point . they absolutely intended to take control of kyiv , but serious miscalculations on their part meant things didn't quite go as planned ."
1803,sorry for poor english . english is not my first language
1804,"wouldnt call iraq and afghan a struggle . at least not compared to how much russia is struggling with taking over the ukraine . natos military was extremely affective in both of those conflicts . now nation building , not so much w / afghan . but definitely an actual struggle w / vietnam ."
1805,"the same reason the soviet union fell is exactly why russia is eating it now . the west can outproduce it . putin seriously seriously miscalculated , his own fault surrounding himself with greedy yes men ."
1806,"you are right , its all because of hunter biden . he convinced them all and ukrainans are givning up the lives of their children for hunter ."
1807,its true russia is making slow gains of territory but at a huge cost of manpower and equipment daily .
1808,stop trolling . we all see through whatever youre doing and its almost comical .
1809,russia is not capable of domestically producing the technologies which keep its economy running . those come from more developed nations . russia relies on extracting resources from the land and shipping those resources abroad so that it can purchase the goods and services which allow it to profitably extract those resources . do you see where this goes if sanctions last for years ?
1810,"were absolutely testing out new kit - its the first time brimstone has ever been used in combat , same with switchblade 600 ( when it arrives ), stryker , etc etc - they even developed a new drone for the uaf . yes were sending them tonnes of old kit , but dont think for a second defence contractors arent making the most of this amazing opportunity . in terms of benefits to the west theyre massive ; - strengthened western alliance and enlarged nato . - the west is seen as unified and strong rather than divided and weak . - china is far less likely to try anything with taiwan . - russia has far less ability to project power around the world and encroach on western interests . all of this achieved and western soldiers dont even have to fire a shot , as far as wars go its been very cheap so far too ."
1811,"its the same shit thats happening in taiwan . if we actually cared about taiwan , we would have done something years ago . instead we traded mad cow diseased beef and defunct nuclear weapons to them while rich manufacturers in taiwan continue to have their factories in china . same situation in ukraine . nato was dangling membership to them in their faces with no intention of ever giving it to them . now that russia invaded they care ? thats shitty . the west fucked up years ago and im afraid it might be too late to rectify it ."
1812,"i would say 70/30 negotiated peace vs russia collapsing militarily , but for the collapse wed need more western weapons and funding asap . eager defence contractors may be able to swing it . hostomel was a tragedy for the russian soldiers that were dropped in to an un-winnable battle , but if you support ukraine as i do then i see it as a great victory admittedly one based on tactical ineptitude rather than ukrainian excellence , but ukraine put up a good fight there and deserve kudos ."
1813,"i agree entirely , its a master stroke ."
1814,"you dont need to apologize . there are native speakers making this mistake . economical means cheap , affordable . economic means related to economics ."
1815,"in all seriousness the longer the war goes the worse it is for russia . winning quick wasn't just a preference it was a necessity . this current push , followed by perhaps one last "" go for broke "" is their best shot . if ukraine can withstand that , we find ourselves in a situation where russia is running dangerously low on trained men , ammunition , and equipment while ukraine continues to refresh with far superior western equipment . my prediction : russia needlessly slaughters a few ten thousand more on both sides , plus thousands more worldwide due to food supply disruptions . eventually its newly gained eastern territory falls back into ukraine's hands . ukraine desires to push even further but the west says "" that's enough "" and russia gets to officially ' keep ' crimea . putin declares this was his intent all along and the world moves on . russia ends up with basically nothing , loses tens of thousands of young men , sets its economy back 15 years , exposes its military as a fraud , and watches sweden and finland join nato . total victory ."
1816,"what are you on about ? us was still fighting and having conflict just until last year . 20 years of struggle , hence why they left . vietnam , cuba , iraq , afghanistan . us couldn't control "" insurgents "" and "" rebels "" in the desert for a reason . people didn't want them there . even now , us refuses to leave iraq while the current government asked them to get out"
1817,struggling with chemical weapons and by bombing laos and cambodia too .
1818,yes a depressed economy ... and the petro ruble or in exercise to that effect is a hidden sanction on the global economy
1819,"argument is that you pulled out of the argument by suddenly changing the focus of your point from "" hurr durr 30/4=7.5 "" to "" well its almost all of the ground captured that they wanted "" which just proved my point that its pointless to argue with ya"
1820,""" in all seriousness "" lmao , you call this "" serious ""? russia has already wrecked europe's economies and weakened the dollar's world reserve currency status . if they hadn't secured a single jar of dirt , they would still be winning ."
1821,we left cause we werent conquering the land . we were never gonna stay there forever and at no point did the ius military ever came close to the losses in a battle that the russians have in the ukraine . the us military did not struggle in iraq nor afghan .
1822,"russia is 1.5 % of the world economy . they may be a big player in the fossil fuel market , but they are only one player . the world energy market will be corrected by market pressures long long before russia is capable of becoming technologically independent ."
1823,"unlikely - western media has been absolutely woeful in reporting on the conflict . i dont recall ever seeing any of those points covered in the content i consume ; its always personal stories of tragedy or heroism - never big picture , strategic stuff . plus , all of those points are simple statements of fact apart from my opinion on china/taiwan . are you able to refute any of them ? if you can , go ahead ."
1824,"apologies i thought we devolved into an actual conversation not random shit you heard on a podcast . but again , well see ."

1826,"this war is a disaster , for both countries . putin holds the country with iron fists and most of the elderly here are already brainwashed enough to assure him victory in every election . actually , its not like votes and opinions of people matter at all . im afraid his next goal is going to be moldova , they are already getting us prepared with new portions of brainwash about "" russians killed and harassed in transnistria "". i really hope something puts an end to this nightmare . one more thing i want to say - please dont hate every single russian citizen . there are still a lot of people left who do not listen to any of the propaganda , but meet hate and harassment online everyday . lets stay strong during these tough times . ukraine will prevail !!! "
1827,"for fuck's sake , we are fighting not for land , but for our people who live on that land and their whole lives ! please , remember that ."
1828,a country of chads
1829,there is little point in giving up land for peace when you know for sure that the other side does not want peace and cannot be trusted .
1830,"this is a bit misleading , it's one thing to not cede territory officially , it's another thing to actively try to recapture it"
1831,stupid putin .
1832,exactly . because peace without that will only result in war in the future .
1833,"i'm sorry for the ukrainians but this is not gonna work when you deal with russians . look at romania , russians took a quarter of our land and it's still theirs and yours ."
1834,"sorry to say , but that's wildly unrealistic . it's been 8 years since russia annexed crimea , it's fully integrated into russia and it's somewhere around 70 % russian , most of whom don't want to be part of ukraine ."
1835,it wouldn't bring peace .
1836,"i hope they succeed but this really doesn't seem very realistic , would the poll be the same if the potential costs of such an operation would be included in the question . if this means 100.000 dead soldiers and 200.000 mamed/dismembered soldiers if even at all possible would they still vote yes ?"
1837,"i'm doubtful they can retake dombass and crimea before the end of the year and i'm doubtful russia would agree to lose crimea , it would be a huge humiliation and possibly lead to revanchism . let's be objective , we are 5 months in , allied nations sent most of what they could already and aside some minor pushes back around kharkiv and kherson russia has still momentum and makes pushes in the dombass . there are also reports that some units are getting formed near kursk likely for a second offensive in northern ukraine in the upcoming months . add to that the fact that ukraine has already mobilized its population while russia didn't and is gathering some of its 200k reservists . i want ukraine to win like everyone but i can't see ukraine pushes russia out of its borders this year and i'm overall doubtful about the outcome of the war . also the constant circle jerk on reddit and twitter about which countries don't give enough and hence are putin's whores , how poland and baktics are doing everything while western nations are allegedly traitors or useless and the cringe dead corpses porn on r/ukraine really push me away from all of this . to me this whole topic has became a circle jerk topic anyway ."
1838,"for people who dont understand why ukrainians insist to take it all back , please watch this video which is approved by ukraine people : ukraine war reason ep1 : ukraine's point of view"
1839,"i'm an american who is a one-issue voter now , and that issue is the candidate on the ballot must vow to continue to support ukraine so long as they ask it of us . there is no better use of my tax dollars than contributing to the decimation of the russian invaders ."
1840,"well , it seems like an imposible scenario , unless some nato country goes in , which won't happen . imo ukraine won't manage to resist past the summer . the attrition is already too high and they have a logistical nightmare with all the different equipment nato has given . they cant move nor store fuel reliably and their exports are fucked . they are also showing they have problems coordinating proper attacks . so imo ukraine won't last much longer , and the only winners of all of this are the us , with all the lng and military contracts being singned and china and india getting resources much cheaper ."
1841,""" asgard is not a place its the people """
1842,retards you will never her it back
1843,i wouldn't really look too much into this
1844,"i'm fully supporting ukraine in this war , but at the same time i find that a lot of people are applying to russians the same kind of dehumanising logic that allows putin and people like him to justify their war crimes . fighting against a fascist regime is much more difficult than most people seem to think here on reddit ."
1845,"the russians gave up on snake island , which means they've given up on odessa . without odessa , transnistria is isolated ."
1846,"yea , i don't know what people were even thinking . unless russia itself gets so much unrest , that it cannot fight anymore , even taking all territories back that do not include crimea and donbass is already a victory , that could be hard to accomplish , but at least there are a chance . russia won't agree to peace , where they didn't gain anything at all , unless it has no choice ."
1847,"not just that either . the principle that those people and that land are not subject to being seized by force is an important one to fight for . that's why the uk fought for the falklands and why i don't think thatcher was entirely bluffing when she told mitterand she'd use nukes if she wasn't given the exocet disarm codes . the principle is more important than the practicality . if all putin wanted was one square foot of bog with one ukranian citizen living in it , the answer would still have to be no ."
1848,"then you should let locals vote on whether they want to be part of ukraine or russia and accept the outcome . i'm sure almost every single region will vote for ukraine at this point , though i have my doubts about crimea and perhaps some small hardcore separatist regions . but the truth is this is about the territorial integrity of ukraine and imperial conquest for russia , not about what locals want . you should be honest about that . of course of the two ukraine is in the right and we ought to support your war for freedom from imperialist aggression , but don't pretend this is about locals when it in fact isn't . if crimea or separatist regions voted to leave ukraine , your government would not accept it and brand them separatists and/or traitors , protecting the territorial integrity of ukraine . so yes , this is about land . the opinion of locals on that land does not matter to either side . it is about land that is ukrainian and currently under conquest by russia . it is about ukraine protecting its borders and russia attempting to expand its borders ."
1849,"please , german intellectuals , stop writing stupid open letters and read this comment !"
1850,"is easy when you dont fight , some people said that recover all land cost at least 50.000 dead , so ....... in my opinion the cost would be very high , and we'll see if they maintain the same opinion when the dead amount to thousands"
1851,"sure , but if it's the latter you remain in a permanent state of war with russia . this could lead to future rekindlings of the hot war and excuses for putin to regroup and invade again ."
1852,"but in case of romania , balance of power was heavily tipped ."
1853,i mean all this points out is their will to not stop fighting until they get their country back .
1854,what russia is experiencing now is one of the worst military boondoggles in modern russian history . anyone still subscribing to the myth of russian inevitability should get their head checked .
1855,would ukraine even be willing to have those 70 % russians ( assuming that number is correct )? getting back crimea might mean that a lot of people need to be displaced . on the other hand legally it belongs to ukraine . and more importantly from a security point of view getting back crimea would likely be beneficial for ukraine . and we all know russia can not be trusted in that regard .
1856,"taking it over would give opportunity for all people that russia forcefully removed to return , people that russia settled after 2014 can simply go back home in russia ."
1857,"crimea was heavily pro-russian even before russian control as well . i fully respect the determination and chadtitude of ukrainian people . they fought valiantly so much and so long , it is only understandable they want something in return but as sad as it is ... it is just unrealistic unless this war drags on for several years , resulting in full implosion of rf ."
1858,"> it's been 8 years since russia annexed crimea , it's fully integrated into russia and it's somewhere around 70 % russian , most of whom don't want to be part of ukraine . mkay . what happened to those ukrainians who lived there , don't you want to know ? do they have more rights to live there compared to these russians ? not going to lie , we don't really care what happens to those russians . we did not push them to live on our occupied territories , they chose this risk themselves . it didn't work out in the end . shit happens ."
1859,the subsequently fracturing of russia might though .
1860,ww3 confirmed then .
1861,i mean maybe ? loads of european countries gave a lot to fight the nazis when it wasn't even ' their problem '
1862,"yes you hit the point i concern the most , i would like to share your comment to others . can i ?"
1863,"nope , the allied nations didn't send most of what they could . they can do much more if there is political will ."
1864,"russia hasnt mobilized its population because it cant without risking massive civil unrest & nato has not even come close to the limit of the support it can provide . defeatist posts like this are why western europeans get ripped so much on here on this subject . if you actually believe that russia has the capability to launch any kind of major offensive in northern ukraine in the near future when they are struggling to take a few km in the donbas , again , you are providing an exact picture of the kind of mentality that gets the western europeans criticized on this . the russian military has been ground to pieces and is increasingly comprised of reserve units which can only conduct small-scale slow advances after continuous artillery support . russia does not have the capability to launch large-scale mechanized offenses at this time . all those forces have been chewed up ."
1865,this is the most based comment i've seen in this group in a long time . it really is a circle jerk in here sometimes . they also love an echo chamber . you hit the nail on the head with your analysis of what is happening and what is very likely to happen in the future .
1866,"> add to that the fact that ukraine has already mobilized its population while russia didn't and is gathering some of its 200k reservists . ukraine didn't mobilize everyone and despite russia in fact is able to forcefully mobilize more people there are three core issues with that : 1 . their propaganda taught their people that ukrainians is a weak non-existent nation , which could be easily defeated by glorious russian army in days . meanwhile , hard brickwall of truth shows that's not the case , and publicly acknowledging it ( by announcing mobilization ) would break the initial propaganda-build image 2 . while they do have quite a lot of people - they don't have that much extra heavy weapons , machinery and logistics capability . all of it is already deployed , there are no reserves . 3 . contrary to their 2014 invasion , this time europe , usa etc ( basically whole world ) is on our side . in 2014 other countries forced us to minsk agreements where we had to give up land . we had no support , we had no allies , russia had minimal sanctions they didn't care about . and some sanctions were explicitly ignored , which is why current russian tanks had optics from france made after 2014 ( was banned by sanctions but both france and russia didn't care apparently ). now though , russia was sanctioned to hell and whole world actually opened eyes and now supports us . so mobilizing more people would make this war longer . of course we do not want that , but what can we do ?"
1867,"well , as ukrainian i can approve it too . it's pretty simplified ( for example , not chornobyl was the reason why ukraine wanted to be away from russia , but the fact that russia occupied ukraine and was trying to wipe ukrainian identity , culture , language for more than 300 years ), but basically correct ."
1868,"the question is how sustainable is the russian position in ukraine . probably not a lot . holding out will be quite expensive with no significant benefits and in the long run russia will need to get out , same thing they did in afghanistan in the 80s . it would be better for russia to suit for peace and getting favorable conditions then to prolong the conflict and lose everything that they have built in the last 40 years . since putin is more interested in his own personal wellbeing than in the wellbeing of russia or the russians , he will push until everything breaks ."
1869,> imo ukraine won't manage to resist past the summer . watch us do it .
1870,"> unless some nato country goes in , which won't happen . you wanna bet money on that ? hold my ywiec and camel cigarettes ..."
1871,"you dont have such an idea about this war , analysts say that now russia has enough strength to capture one city of maxim and if they dont go on the defensive , then they dont feel very good , meanwhile ukraine uses only 4 volley fire systems from the americans destroyed supposedly several dozen objects in the rear of the russians , including forced them to leave the sharp snake"
1872,did we find a tankie ?
1873,"*"" in my opinion ""*; well that's a reliable source there . show me your detailed analysis of troop and material dispositions , reinforcement rates , and depletion rates , based on current and projected impact of sanctions and nato supplies , and then maybe we should lend some credence to your words ."
1874,"it isn't about what is possible or not . the war itself is the goal of the powers that be . having a war in ukraine turned out to be extremely profitable for all that are involved in the oil and gas trade . on top of that the arms trade is blossoming . ukraine , russia and eu are all losers in this game . but for the ones making profits , the war needs to be prolonged as much as possible , the outcome is basically irrelevant . first it was nato membership , now it is territorial integrity - ukrainians being manipulated to antagonize the russians for third party profit without end ."
1875,"because its our land , why should we give it up to someone . i was born in crimea , and im not russian ."
1876,"do you know there is an ethnic called , crimea tartars? . meanwhile , the majority russians in crimea is also cossacks . cossacks are the main ukraine ethnic actually . one thing we need to know is that in ukraine people , language doesnt matter , more than half ukrainians actually speak russian language . the main difference between ukrainians and russians are their opinion to freedom . ukrainians think freedom is more important than life . russians think life is more important than freedom ."
1877,"true but don't forget that ukrainians had two revolutions while russians did nothing . some people do something to shape their future , others don't ."
1878,"thank you for your comment . you are right , they gave up snake island but not yet stopping on trying to take odessa . it was told to be one of the main goals of this horrible war , and people here on the tv keep talking about it . lets hope none of their plans come true "
1879,"well , please watch this video posted by donbas youth ( has english subtitles ), all of them are now sent to frontline gradually and becomes cannon fodder each by each . donbas people dont like putin as well . another concern is that : in ukrainians point of view , this is 8 years war instead of an year . people are afraid of that if they cede them for peace , russia will come again someday ."
1880,100 % we have settled to not redraw the borders . now we have to adhere to it .
1881,you can't hold a meaningful referendum under foreign military occupation .
1882,"i live on occupied territories and i dont want to be part of russia . if i speak my voice out in the public or on the internet non-anonymous , i would be punished by 10-20 years in prison in best case scenario , in worst ill be shot on site . and im not even talking about forced mobilization of population with ukrainian passports to fight for czar putin"
1883,"u>i'm sure almost every single region will vote for ukraine at this point , there lies the problem . it appears that you are from the netherlands , and yet you are more sure than my wife's ukrainian relatives - some of them live or lived in lughanks region , and in fact felt that many there were more pro russian than ukrainians ."
1884,the dead already amounts to thousands .
1885,"indeed . the situations are very much different . hope you recover all your land and people and find peace . our government should help ukraine more , but unfortunately there a lot of incompetents and russian spies in the upper circles here ."
1886,"easy , russians who moved to crimea after 2014 are there illegally and get deported . ta-dah ."
1887,"> and we all know russia can not be trusted in that regard . in any regard . which is why currently there are no peace talks going - russia only understands power and we need that military power supplied by our allies . no diplomacy works with these particular bandits , which is confirmed by minsk agreements ."
1888,assuming they want to return . many probably have build a live for themselves somewhere else . giving all that up once again after 8 years is probably not something everyone is willing to do . so not everybody who once lived in crimea will return .
1889,"> crimea was heavily pro-russian even when under russian control as well . no it wasn't . russian propaganda built that image ( about both crimea and many other regions such as my home kharkiv region ). it is pro-russian now because during these 8 years of occupation they deported or killed most ukrainians and now its mostly inhabited by russians themselves . > it is just unrealistic unless this war drags on for several years , resulting in full implosion of rf . no not really . russian forces are already basically stopped , and most sanctions effect didn't even hit them yet , while their economy already shows degrading signs - look here :"
1890,"in the 2001 census 60 % 1,450k were russians , 24 % 576k were ukrainians and 10.8 % 258k were tartars living on crimea . if you also take into consideration that a ukrainian donated the administrative control of crimea to the ukrainian ssr it is understandable that most there are russians historically post mongol empire and sucessor states . i dont know a fair way to handle crimea after which no side cries foul . i guess 2013 residents could vote again ? but that would ignore all the teenagers from crimea that have come of age . so what would you propose how to determine , where crimea should go to ?"
1891,"be careful what you wish for . that could be a great source of instability , maybe for decades . and there are nuclear weapons that could go missing and end up in less sensible hands ."
1892,"yeah , all those states who had their dictators kicked out ended up becoming far more peaceful - oh wait .."
1893,"it already started , you just don't want to admit or believe it did"
1894,"i'm genuinely interested , apart from troops , what more ?"
1895,"i didnt said ukraine will be defeated , i don't expect either side to have any decisive victory in this war . i am not a military person but it does looks like the frontlines won't move much in the months to come and as both sides will be struggling to sustain the war ( zelensky himself said the war need to be over before winter ) i think both russia and ukraine are mostly trying to have some ground for futures peace negotiations i disagree with the trending take about how this war is making russia falling apart and hence the west needs to "" finish it "". major powers win and lose wars , ussr lost the winter war ( kinda ) but won afterward against nazi germany , usa are still there after being defeated in vietnam and the afghanistan war and france is still a major power after the big defeat of 1940 as much as france was again a major military power in 1914 after the terrible defeat of 1870 . what i mean is that russia will still be a major power after this war . actually usa needs a russia on their side against china for the future but that's another topic . maybe a regime change can happens but nothing guarantee us that it will be a kind democratic one and not a radical jingoist one ."
1896,"for 300 years , i quote , servant of people at 13:10"
1897,"because i need to shorten the video , so something will not be much explicit"
1898,"it's a mess for russia , but ... ultimately they invaded . this is a signal that it's much higer stake for them and they are willing to take much higher risk than us . also , russia is not a liberal democracy , so although they have to watch out about public opinion , their political elites have much more leeway for unpopular stuff than us . also , i think russians have been much smarter that we want to admit , and we pat our backs because their military fucked up big time , but it isn't like they're crumbling . they have natural resources we don't , and they're adapting their legislation so , for example , they can build cars with lower specs but that allow to do it internally and avoid needing imports from western countries . can you picture the eu lowering emission and safety regs so we can build cars like in 2010 and manufacturers following suit in less than a year ? i doubt it . so let's not kid ourselves . they fucked up big time but it's not like we have a clear upper hand , and most of the world isn't very supportive either . and the us is using this as a business opportunity , i can tell you some stuff is happening around here , in the sourthern eu frontier ."
1899,how come you aren't on the front line bro
1900,"yeah , i can bet money on poland not setting a foot in ucraine ."
1901,"russia has already captured a fairly big chunk of ukraine , much more of what they already had . russia can get into defend strategies which is way easier than being the attacker ."
1902,whos been shipping lng at super premium rates to europe ? not exactly a secret . also didnt the countries that provided soviet weapons said a condition for that would be to have it backfilled by nato weapons ? the us is banking six ways from sunday from this conflict
1903,no you didn't .
1904,"yes , he gave his opinion . he never said he was a reliable source . whats your problem ?"
1905,"what a petty comment . yes , it's my opinion , take it as you want . this a forum after all . i've just been following the spanish osint scene , and i think they've done a good job ."
1906,"ukraine said themselves they are losing about 1k men daily ( dead and injured combined ), but the real number is probably bigger . some military expert even claims ukraine lost more men than there are in british army , which is about 82k - 102k according to internet ."
1907,"russia can stop war today by fucking off behind their own borders , only reason war is still going on is russia"
1908,"that might be true , but with the worldview russian elites hold it was bound to happen sooner or later . like it or not , the eurasian dreams cannot become a reality because of russia . if russia wanted they could be just trade partners of the eu , which is what everyone here wanted of them . and if they really cared they would offer something attractive to ex satellite countries , so they don't desperately move away when they have a chance . but it is what it is and we have to live with it ."
1909,> ukrainians being manipulated to antagonize the russians just like slovenes were manipulated to antagonize the serbs ?
1910,dead russian activists would disagree with you
1911,"yeah , i feel some people * conveniently * gloss over this too much ."
1912,"to take odessa they would have to take mykolaiv , but instead of attacking that , theyre on the defensive around kherson ."
1913,and the russians will come again if all they get is russias word on not invading again . they already had that prior to 2014 .
1914,quoth the ira .
1915,totally understandable . we've been there very recently .
1916,"i agree that some maybe wont return , but its really up to them to decide once crimea is liberated , shruging shoulders and saying eh not worth liberating since russian replacements wont like it will send dangerous message that ethnic cleansing pays off even in 21st ."
1917,> i guess 2013 residents could vote again ? there were no votes . much like there were no votes in russia ( not a single one ). voting simply does not work for non-democratic state and russia is authoritorian regime .
1918,more like a cold war .
1919,ukraine is more comparable to vietnam than a world war .
1920,oh i do . i just dont like it .
1921,"i mean if you go on some subreddits or on twitter you will see a crowd of people saying stuff like "" just send all of them ( caesars ) and most of your tanks , you don't need them ukraine is fighting for you "" and similar takes that got usually highly upvoted"
1922,more artillery and tanks .
1923,"biden has announced on the nato summit that a coalition of more than 50 countries will send 600 tanks , 500 artillery systems , 600000 shells , and 140000 anti-tank weapons . that's the additional help on which they agreed on june 30 ."
1924,"a significant portion of the military aid hasnt even arrived yet . merely been pledged . so the situation is still in flux . powers can and do collapse . history is full of them . sometimes they recover , sometimes they dont . but notably , russia while still existing is no longer the soviet union and can only dream enviously of the power and influence it once had . will it be the end of the russian nation if russia loses ? no . but it may signal the end of its capacity to participate in the great game for a significant period of time . that is a worthy goal . its not just a question of winning or losing a war or even economics . things like demographics , corruption , innovation all play a major part in a nations ability to bounce back from a crisis . id love to know what analysis you are reading that says victory agaisnt china is only possible if the us allies russia becaise not only is that never going to happen , i would frankly rather * lose * than that abomination ever occur ."
1925,"sure , good work ! my comment was like "" wow , great video , here's what i have to add """
1926,"> ruble is the best performing currency this year . im sorry but that's just bullshit . ruble to dollar ratio does indeed look better . however , giant nuance is that russian market is closed . it means people inside russia cant use dollars . it does make dollar cheap inside russia because there's no use for it . but it doesn't make ruble good in any way - demand for this currency outside of russia is next to nonexistent , as many companies withdraw from russia ( i understand many companies stay , but demand for ruble is still decreasing ) on top of that , russia defaulted couple days ago . which means their outside property could be legally seized . and all creditors legally could demand payments any day they want . of course not everyone will do it . but some will , which will decrease their economy ( and currency along the way ) even further ."
1927,"> the ruble is the best performing currency this year . the ruble is a non tradable currency . it is so bad that trade between india and russia needs to use the chinese renminbi . > their only problem is they outsourced some tech from the west , but the chinese will end up transferring it . they didn't . due to communism they were quite back technologically . china will not transfer any technology to russia . they are not interested in the well being of russia . they have their own interest and week russia is definitely to their benefit . > the ukrainians will resist indefinitely because theyre a nato proxy are you sure ? this is quite the wishful thinking . did in the 80s ukraine succeed from the ussr due to external pressure or due to them wanting western quality of life ?"
1928,"> theyre in a better position economically right now than last year . so this is why even russian economists are predicting a 8-10 % gdp loss this year and their politicians are constantly wailing about the sanctions ? why do they predict a 10 year (!!) recession ? > they run a gigantic current account surplus yes , because they're exporting fossils and they can't import squat . > and the ruble is the best performing currency this year . see above on imports and exports . > their only problem is they outsourced some tech from the west , but the chinese will end up transferring it . chinese companies are pulling out of russia . not even their eternal friend china will sell them what they need , and why would they ? what idiot will risk secondary sanctions for the sake of a country that holds 2 % of the world's semi-conductor market ? it's not _some_ outsourced tech from the west . it's most of the advanced tech , period . for example , with how nicely they stole all the planes they won't be getting spare parts for them . you do realize that there's a very large distance between petersburg and vladivostok , and while freight can be transported by rail that takes 7,5 days , the people not so much ?"
1929,"and yet they are reliant on eu support in order to extract the minerals that they have . their war industry relies heavily on technology from the eu and the usa . of china does not step in , which they haven't done in this particular case , the russian economy will crumble back to the post soviet economy they had . russia demise will be slow for a very long time until one day it crumbles . just like what happened with the soviet union ."
1930,lol
1931,"recruitment office told me to fuck off because "" too small "" any more questions ?"
1932,because you're no fun . why can't you think outside the box a bit more .
1933,"plot twist : poland invades western ukraine , bringing the mighty lwow back in the fold ."
1934,"nothing wrong with the us winning . europe was much better and stable when the us was the sole world superpower in the 1990s than it is now when america's position is being contested by china and russia . american dominance and their role as the policeman of the world is in europe's interest . if the us collapses , europe won't survive on its own either , russians and chinese will subdue it because why not ?"
1935,"my point is that we live in a time where everyone spews forth their uninformed opinions on things they have no clue about , and there's enough morons around to ensure that those become gospel and before you know it you have vaccine deniers , fictional election fraud , parliaments get stormed , etc etc ."
1936,"you are making projections without demonstration knowledge of the current state , or the factors determining the development from said . the conclusions you come to are completely irrelevant when analysed , yet you provide them with certainty . might even be a case of donning-kruger ."
1937,"russian bots dont count as military experts , and ukraine sure as shit didnt say they are losing 1k men daily . only time anything similar was mentioned was 50-100 soldiers daily in the beginning of donbass offensive ."
1938,"i've done a mistake . this sub is filled with young feelgood addicted people . the reality is much more grim , sadly ."
1939,"your numbers are very off . ukraine is estimated to have around 50-100 dead men per day , much less than what russia loses . ukraine is trading territory for lives in hope of a russian collapse ."
1940,> they would offer something attractive they have nothing to offer . absolutely nothing . all they have is a stick and no carrot .
1941,"in case of slovenia the war lasted 10 days and slovenia got what it wanted . it was not a conflict that would destroy both sides with no attainable goal in sight for either side . apart from that slovenia had no support from outside , no boris johnson offering arms and military training constantly ... it took quite a long time for us and others to even recognize it's independence after it was all over . so no , it was not that similar in this regard ."
1942,"so we should just redraw all maps in the world , because therere minorities everywhere ? why wouldnt russia give independence to their republics , where russians are the minority ?"
1943,"conveniently for what ? to not have to agree that russians are some kind of uncivilised , subhuman , vile race which deserves ... what ? if you're ukrainian i can humanly understand your hatred for russia , but remember that hatred doesn't bring anything good in the long term . i want ukraine to defeat this invasion militarily , but without going back to the hate based ideologies which brought us wwi and wwii"
1944,"hitler promised not to invade czechoslovakia jeremy , welcome to the real world"
1945,"hope you were treated well and with dignity if you came as a refugee . we have some amazing volunteers and civil society , but the state institutions are hampering them and quite neglectful ."
1946,it looks pretty hot in ukraine .
1947,"i don't think any of that will happen . they will struggle because they've invested capital into eu tech and will need to find substitutes . this will be costly , a long endeavour and they'll probably will find that they can't find any for some stuff , but ultimately they can buy western tech through third parties . unless china , india and other smaller countries stop buying their exports there will be no russian economy "" collapse "". they will suffer , but they're no stupid people , they can shift , and they are indeed doing so ."
1948,"i can think outside the box . look , right-wingers will win our next elections , meaning the beginning of the new holy crusade . spain will just begin producing massive ammounts of weapons and ammo and will conquer half the planet again . you'll be ruled by a tortilla de patatas and forced to assimilate into mediterranan superior style of life . the other half of the planet will be barbaric , so who cares ."
1949,nothing wrong with winning except that winning literally comes with the strings you accuse russia of having over the eu . it subjugates the eu under the us . eu was better and more stable when the us was the sole superpower yes because your little police man regime changed nations from latin america to asia and everything in between . decapitating nations who literally had democratically elected heads of state . hamstrining every attempt at developing politically or economically . - the fact that you think this was anything but outright monstreous shows how bullshit the rules based system and freedome and democracy argument is the western world uses . russia and china breaking the us hegemony over enforcement is in the worlds interest . because it limits the reach of the west path of chaos . russia and china neither have the military capability nor economic capacity to subdue the eu . all they care about is that their backyards are not turned into staging grounds for attacks . they dont give a shit who governs where on the other side of the planet . making any damage you accuse them of to be in the direct vicinity rather than globally
1950,he literally wrote in my opinion what do you want more ? you are confusing opinion sharing and professional reporting 
1951,"this is a forum , no one is writing a paper here . if you're going to whine for it , save yourself the trouble and ignore me ."
1952,"i said losing as injured and dead combined = when exactly is russia supposed to collapse ? they are one of the largest producer of grain so they're not going to starve just because of sanctions , they have oil , gas and other natural resources that they can sell to other countries . as long as big countries like china and india keep buying from russia , it's not going to collapse"
1953,"my point was about whether slovenes were antagonized with serbs by some foreign force , i'm not comparing the course of respective wars directly . why you couldn't simply live in peace and love with serbs within yugoslavia while you offer this solution to ukrainians regarding russians ?"
1954,bro wtf i was talking about their apparent inability to take action against their psychopathic government .
1955,the cold war was only cold in europe . other places were quite warm even if no us soldiers directly shot a russian or the opposite .
1956,"unfortunately , but it's not ww3 ."
1957,"you really need to stop going on about the ruble . it's not a freely traded currency you can use to - actually do normal _trade_ with the world . you can't trade because the world refuses to sell you anything , including the machinery needed to extract oil and gas . elvira nabiullina is the woman most responsible for propping up this ruble you admire so much , and all she had to say about the russian economy since february is "" bad , bad , and more bad news "". but i suppose she doesn't know what she's saying , am i right ?"
1958,"care to explain how the soviet union collapsed ? was it due to external pressure , like somebody imposing embargo on them ? did someone stop to buy their resources ? no ! so , how did it happen ? answering this question will help you understand why russia is having such a good time and why the way forward is only down . the russian economy is in a much worse state than the economy of the ussr . it is a shame for the russian folk who will live through another insanely hard period ."
1959,you could have chosen to learn from this . i suspect you will not and continue pushing unsubstantiated opinions with conviction . best of luck .
1960,"axious sure as shit isnt ukraine source , so i dont see relevance of linking some random journal . give proper source where ukraine officials claimed what you claim they did"
1961,"those numbers are believed to be an "" exaggeration "" to get more weapons from the west . if you haven't noticed , russia is running out of troops on the ground . their attrition isn't sustainable ."
1962,"oooh look , it's ' might makes right '. don't see that one used quite so openly very often ."
1963,give it time . our head clowns are thrilled about the new boogey man they can blame all of their failures on .
1964,> russia is running out of troops on the ground that's why they still have 2 mil reservists
1965,"well tbh the other argument ( in the abstract sense , not talking about the particular case ) is also based on might makes right . if a region of a country genuinely wishes to secede from the country , then it is the might of the original country that stops or otherwise prevents its secession . i'm not sure you could construe an argument for practical intrastate relations that doesn't run into might makes right at some point along the chain . it's not like you can ever please everyone in a country , after all ."
1966,"both usa and eu are projected to grow in gdp , only less than predicted before . meantime russia is set to fall cca 10 % or more . you don't see a difference between these two sets of economies ? here's production for you , and that's just after a few months of war : > cars : - 96.7 % > trucks : - 39.3 % > ice motors : - 57 % > pass . train wagons : - 59.8 % > fiberglass cables : - 80.8 % > fridges : - 58.1 % > washing machines : - 59.2 % > ac electric motors : - 49.9 % > excavators : - 60 % this leads to unemployment , the same as lack of tech parts and companies and markets in general . unemployment leads to fewer taxes to the state and more burden on the state's social funds , it also raises risks of social unrest . at the same time the lack of trade for spare parts brings lowered production of high-tech war supplies ( see recent exbibits of their _dumb_ bombs managing to miss a target 8/8 times as to why this matters ). you can't just go to some global atm where you'll insert your zombie ruble and get fighter jets back . they are in a worse shape than when they started , and you being deliberately obtuse about the janky trade balance doesn't change that . > go to war with a nato proxy ? and now i'm done wasting time talking to you , bot with suspiciously deleted reddit posting history ."
1967,this completely ignores the option for peaceful secession .
1968,"it does , because if you notice , i'm specifically talking about * stopping or otherwise preventing * secession . i'm not sure why you would think bringing up peaceful secession is relevant ."
1969,russia doesn't even have the instruments to take a shit in a civilised way
1970,"putin : "" everyone must pay ruble or no more gas by friday "" friday comes , gas still flowing putin : "" everyone must pay in ruble until april 1st or no gas "" april 1st comes , gas still flowing putin : "" we will not tolerate delivery of heavy weapons and convoys are legitimate targets "" czech republic sends tanks and other heavy weaponry putin : "" we will stop delivering gas to poland at april 27th "" april 27th comes , gas still flowing putin : "" intervening in t ..."" western countries : "" stfu putin k thx """
1971,"sorry , am i crazy or are we still in late february ?"
1972,"shiver me timbers , i so scared ."
1973,i've got an instrument for putin : world's smallest violin .
1974,"more sabre rattling and no action , that's the russian way !"
1975,hes been saying this since the 2nd day i believe .
1976,did someone say something ?
1977,""" oh wow , this is worthless !"""
1978,nato : so you want metro 2033 in 2022 . we got ourselves a deal . ![ img](emote|t5_2qqcn|9151 )
1979,"putin , putin , spu ta bania , to pierdolenie jest nie do wytrzymania ."
1980,so basically he is threatening to commit suicide by cop .
1981,"at this point , most eu countries , by themselves alone , could sustain and perhaps defeat russia . poland would definitely be a challenge for russia . france could do more than defend herself . the uk would crush whats left of russia . the only thing russia has is nukes and they know using that would be a greenlight for the un and nato to use all their conventional forces to put a stop to this . we wouldnt use nukes ( unless in a mad scenario ), but our conventional forces would be engaged ."
1982,"i really wonder what the thought behind this is .. it seems unlikely he would act on it but then does he think anyone would take his threat seriously ? does he believe the world is still intimidated by him ? i do not see what he could possibly think he could achieve with this . his cover is blown , the faade has collapsed and russia has been exposed as a weak and insignificant country on the international playing field , their military is nothing what it was claimed to be .. and sure , it's still a significant force purely by numbers and they can brute force a lot of fights with complete disregard for life on either side , but proven to be entirely incompetent . their economy hasn't developed in decades , still solely rely on exporting resources , not something they created , not something they developed , just something that happened to be there .. and they've turned to using their primary source of income as their primary bargaining chip when they stand to lose more than anyone else by it ... excluded from the world market they have nothing . their government is just corrupt , run by incompetent morons who are selected for their dick sucking capabilities and nothing else .. incapable of anything other than pocketing money and ruining their country from the inside , pretending to be on par with the eu and us whilst half the population is still shitting in a hole in the woods ."
1983,"ya know what , call his fucking bluff . do it putin , fuck off with your empty threat bullshit you wanker ."
1984,"stop wasting our time , putler , nobody cares . and if you really are that stupid and attack eu/nato , you will be obliterated within days"
1985,"we need to start recognizing the right way to address putin . "" russian dictator vladamir putin ..."" nah dog . say it right - "" russian ** fascist ** dictator vladimir putin ..."""
1986,bitch please . we are all waiting for you to go into a nato country . do it . cant wait to kick your ass back to russia and then take out the cursed kremlin
1987,"this is exactly why putin must be stopped here and now . our children and their children for all time cannot live under the threats of a criminal . the world cannot function under these conditions any more than it could if hitler were the master of the world . this battle is not only for the ukraine or countries of the west , it is for the whole free world and those about to be set free ."
1988,don't look now vlad but all those dead ru tanks got that way via western javelins . and those new 155mm excaliburs ? yeah those came from the west too . the west isn't afraid of petty little dictators since the orange scourge lost his job .
1989,"what putin might do scares me . i am also sick of being threatened , and i refuse to be intimidated . i would rather die than live under the whip of a tyrant ."
1990,"pussin , your threats are less and less effective"
1991,he might be talking about the hypersonic missiles . if he thinks he can fight more countries than ukraine at one time he is delusional .
1992,i think he is misunderstanding the hesitation for direct involvement as fear instead of a shitload of countries just waiting for him to throw the first punch so they have clear legal justification to stomp him into a mudhole .
1993,a telling sign they're really having it bad .
1994,do it pussy we are waiting !
1995,"poor dude , he's with the back on a wall and is anyway in panic to get fucked from the nato . edit or better , by the ukrainian heroes with the help of nato weapons . that's probably more accurate ."
1996,pfff ... dare you to do it . and see what happens .
1997,"russia needs to stop with these baseless threats . it's pathetic at this point . either attack nato , or shut up . everyone is tired of this ."
1998,russia isn't the second strongest military in the world ... it barely holds that title of second strongest in ukraine . article 5 putin : fuck around and find out .
1999,"we've been intervening since day one , moron ."
2000,""" goys im serious this time , like seriously serious . i am super cereal you guys !!!"" - putin"
2001,"whether an empty threat or not , both ways this is a major sign of weakness ."
2002,"please russia , do so !!!!! i want to see article 5 invoked"
2003,"just remember these speeches are not intended for us in the west . they are for the brainwashed masses in russia who put him and keep him in power . this is to raise russian morale . pay no attention , children"
2004,been saying this since the war in ukraine started . nothing to see here people
2005,i would recommend russia redirects its anger by making more toilets .
2006,if he nukes nato hes fucked so 
2007,meh ... russia will send some calibr missile on poland or something the us will reciprocate by taking down 50-100 fighter jets . they will call it quits .
2008,can this guy just shut the hell up already ? edit : can someone just shut him the hell up already ? 
2009,"well , i for one , am ready for the celebratory party after russia gets its ass handed to it . so do it , russia . this whole mess you started will be over real fkn fast . then we can all celebrate"
2010,"i have a better idea , putin . you immediately fuck off in ukraine , pay to rebuild their country , and turn yourself in to stand trial for war crimes . then maybe russia can rejoin the civilized world ."
2011,"these comments are for his russian audience . putin is in desperate trouble and knows that if the russian people find out , he will be done for . so he will huff and puff and bluster , uttering empty menaces until the end , his end ."
2012,it's a shame those countries do not have the capability to strike back . oh wait .... lol
2013,putin inflicted unprovoked wide scale slaughter of ukrainians threatening world to stay away . now when world became united as never before he threatens again . is he asking for being finished off ?
2014,that fucking nonce is making a prize prat of himself and his country . have the russians forgotten who started all this shit ? why is this man still in charge ?
2015,well thanks ukraine ur awesomeness has tainted call of duty forever . the story has 0 credibility now .
2016,what a desperate and pathetic criminal .
2017,"sort of missleading phrasing of the tweet i guess ? according to other media outlets he said * if someone intends to intervene into the ongoing events ( in ukraine ) from the outside and creates unacceptable strategic threats for us , then they should know that our response to those strikes will be swift , lightning fast, putin said during an address to lawmakers in st petersburg .* "" our response to thouse strikes will be swift , lightning fast """
2018,"i would say , tit for tat ."
2019,yeah try it and give us a reason to article 5 you . ive had my fill of watching war crimes and atrocities in near real-time and would like to move on to bombing every piece of russian military equipment in ukraine .
2020,russia doesnt even have sufficient military assets to turn the tide or war in ukraine .
2021,so he's calling it a war now ?
2022,natomedlemsskap kan inte komma fort nog .. / nato membership cant come soon enough
2023,""" instruments ."" yeah , i bet . i hope i'm wrong , but i think he's fucking full of shit . come on . if the military was pilfered so fucking badly by corruption over thirty years , does anyone really not think that it also included their nuclear arsenal ? you don't have to have a working nuke to terrorize the world if everyone thinks it still works ."
2024,"reminder to respect ukr op-sec by not sharing videos of ukr soldier locations or any other such classified intelligence you discover or witness online . news sources : godspeed ukrainians . ways to help ukraine ( charities ) please message me if there are any translation errors , typos , or dead links . this comment was made by a bot . original comment from iamkunii on r/worldnews"
2025,"invasion of countries , killing of the unarmed is a russian privilege and demands no retaliation ."
2026,who is he going to strike ? the entire rest of the civilized world ?
2027,uh huh . why havent you done it yet bitch ?
2028,so hes going to strike most of the free world ? i dont see this going in russias favor .
2029,what army ?
2030,wtf doe immediate strikes mean to him . because countries are intervening
2031,but that would be war ! and who ya think gonna lose ?
2032,"i hope we have his bunker id , depth , scope and inside access ... z"
2033,"its like russia doesnt want to be a country anymore , keep running your mouth you piece of shit putin . we can beat you on our own , you fight nato and it will be the end of russia . youll be balkanised by june ."
2034,guess that special operation ain't goin so well .
2035,"we do not intervene , we don't even give ukraine weapons .. what you talking about ? we just sell equipment with a special discount price operation . "
2036,"you attack with your missiles vladimir , not your mouth . show us the missiles ."
2037,"must be old news , pretty sure i've heard that shit before"
2038,the further it goes the less credible ruzzian military and empty threats become 
2039,no one . absolutely none giving a flying fuck to putin
2040,just do it so the whole world can wipe this shitstain off the fuckin planet .
2041,putin will make a call to far and one of his generals or top staff members thats a nato informant will be given the order to neutralize him .
2042,"did putin use the word "" war "" ? what happened to the special operation ?"
2043,that fucker thinks that his is the only country that has nukes !
2044,what does he mean would interfere with what is going in in ukraine ? youre a fucking idiot putin . several countries have been fucking around in ukraine for the past 60 days your asshats have been there . his words mean zero to me . fake phony falsehood tales stories lies threats - fuck him and the horse he rode in on . his army is literal shit . all he has is numbers . he ought to be flamingly humiliated by this catastrophe he started . putin huilio suka blyat . you will never survive this dude . your political days are fing over yo . you are disinvited to the world stage dude . go suck xis tiny dick . everyone hates you . you are satan incarnate . i literally cannot wait for the day you no longer are in power and/or dead . you go ahead and do what you think you need to do pootholewe can literally destroy moscow in one fucking day .
2045,"( brit here ) come on then mr putin . try it . any form of attack on us will be met with swift action . we may have a relatively small military , but there is no way you can get your tanks here , no way you can really get any form of air superiority here , and you can bet your crazzy little vodka infused ass , we have our subs ready to go on a moment's notice . even if you do , somehow , manage to invade , you will face an army of pissed off chavs , poshies , and football fans who will be ever so slightly miffed you interrupted our tea and crumpets ."
2046,immediate strikes ? alright we got our hands over the article 5 button . attack us all you like we got nuke as well bitch .
2047,i do think that this guy has just been dying to flex his nuke muscle for years and is desperately trying to find an excuse to use them . i'll be surprised if this ends before he's done so . and even if ( when ) nato gets involved it will probably be after enormous civilian carnage . someone needs to destroy this man .
2048,"lol , that's nearly the whole world that little bitch is threatening ! we've seen the performance of your shitty army . go fuck yourself , putin . "
2049,- bring it on .
2050,you re wasting your missiles then/s .
2051,the walls are closing in 
2052,"do it , pussy ![ img](emote|t5_2qqcn|9004 )"
2053,he is really trying to find out
2054,so it is a war ?
2055,"do it pootin , i double dare you ."
2056,"i'll be surprised if russia even has organised enough "" instruments "" for a band to play at their victory day parade coming up monday after next ."
2057,"finally , someone calling him a dictator and not a president"
2058,wish there was a nicer way of saying c u next tuesday
2059,putin you aint shit and youre 5 7 
2060,i am putin . lower your shields and surrender your ships . we will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own . your culture will adapt to service us . resistance is futile .
2061,russia vs the literal rest of the world got it .
2062,bring it .
2063,come at us bro
2064,"hey putin , go fuck yourself !"
2065,russia is just a empty bottle on the road ready to be driven over .
2066,"i mean he said the same w months ago when this started , and no attack has happened , everyone knows hes's bluffing , i'm sure the us and the eu has the intelligence to know if they have the capability to do that ."
2067,"do it , lets dance motherfucker . ive been screaming for us to get involved no matter the consequences from the beginning . fuck little dick putin , fuck russia ."
2068,get that article-5 ready bruh !!!
2069,you and what logistics 
2070,"yeah , good luck with that , pooty-poot . you will just get struck back even harder ."
2071,lets get it own then 
2072,god i hope someone intervenes . particularly someone that's close allies with usa .
2073,that guy really wants to see article 5 being executed
2074,this guy is the leader of the geographically largest country in the world . how does he have such little introspection that he doesn't realise he sounds like hitler stuck on repeat ?
2075,putin needs to just do it or stfu .
2076,russia / putler are shitting themselves . this is a good sign for ukraine .
2077,can putin just fuck off already .
2078,if he even touches nato he will have ukraine + nato hammering down on his ass . he can't win this conflict if he goes down this route . it will just be one big open invitation for nato to enter the conflict then .
2079,another day another threat .
2080,he huffs and he puffs but mainly he bluffs . slava ukraine
2081,i wonder if putin is going to get suicided like the oligarchs
2082,that would be suicide but let's see what happens .
2083,russia has nothing lol
2084,"well , i'm sure the rest of the world has a few secret weapons too ."
2085,"go ahead you twat , sign your own death warrant ."
2086,if my instruments he's talking about nuclear missiles this man needs to be dealt with sooner than later
2087,i am curious how long it will take for him to realise that threats doesnt scare us after they showed how utterly thrash they are
2088,"oh putin , go shove it ."
2089,he is ridiculous . he can't be out of power soon enough .
2090,"i'm so sick of this stupid motherfucker and his threats . let me tell you , his threats do not intimidate nato and the united states . if they got involved russia would have to fight all of europe and he would lose badly and look even more incompetent than he already does.he can eat shit"
2091,fuck around and find out . nato article5 pleasegiveusanexcusetostartshooting
2092,"at this point , bring it ."
2093,"oh please , oh please , oh please i genuinely hope ruzzia wants to fuck around and find out ."
2094,stuff it you cold war era bastard .
2095,ok boomer .
2096,war ? i thought it was a special operation .
2097,"strikes with what , precisely ? they gonna throw frying pans or"
2098,i thought it wasn't a war president fuck face
2099,lol after the russians immediate strike against kyiv 
2100,putin can suck our collective dicks .
2101,"oh look , he finally reworded the threat he has been making for two months now ..."
2102,"to paraphrase conor mcgregor , ' you'll do fookin nothin !'"
2103,do it . pussy
2104,"yeh , no . attacking nato leads to the death of russia . stop reading the daily mail ."
2105,im tired of people publishing russian threats . whats the point when we know they are all empty ?
2106,what does he call what the west has been doing already ? nobody is afraid of him anymore because we refuse to be cowed .
2107,pleasssseeee give the us an excuse to break this boot off in your ass
2108,"put the bottle down vlad and go home , the world is laughing at you ."
2109,i call bluff
2110,"swing then bitch , we fucking dare you ."
2111,"* sigh * that wouldn't have been a believable threat months ago . do they really expect everyone to take that seriously now , after all that's happened these last two months ? you couldn't have fought like 70 % of the world's military power at your best let alone when you're already bogged down and taking a pounding . the thing about threats is that they have to be believable ."
2112,he must have forgotten that the path of war it is not a one way street .
2113,good . now i'll donate even more to ukraine
2114,having trouble with one country russia then thinks it can fight 40 ? i have a hard time believing they are that stupid .
2115,"oh fuck off putin , you gonna bomb 40 fucking countries.....what a fucking idiot ."
2116,yes please ! i double dare you putler ! attack a nato country !! doooo eeeeett !!! then we can finally end this farce .
2117,"another stupid lie from another stupid orc . put up or shut up at this point . the sooner putin unleashes his alleged "" fury "" on the world , the sooner the world can completely obliterate russia . we need to be done with these primitive miscreants once and for all ."
2118,"putin is like the guy sitting on the bed , telling the gorgeous woman just how great its going to be when he gets around to banging her . but he never does , she just gets out mr . buzz buzz for the umpteenth time ."
2119,"when 95 % of russian nuclear missiles function like this one ..., i am not worried . ["
2120,what ah bitch ass bitch .
2121,putin : * issues threats very threateningly * usa : na na na na boo boo stick your head in doo doo
2122, poor vladdy he has to know that kgb gaslighting doesnt work anymore .
2123,come get some .
2124,"i wonder if putin realizes that if he starts using nuclear weapons , he himself will not survive . but if he wants to proceed with the conventional army against nato countries , then you only have to look how the russian army performs against the far inferior ukrainian army . more than pathetic . what you can see now in the russian army is where extensive corruption leads . according to the money spent , the army should be well equipped , but unfortunately all the money never reached the army ."
2125,"blah , blah , blah . fuck putler !"
2126,blah blah blah
2127,stop
2128,ok who installed internet explorer on putin \` s pc ?
2129,the kruschev playbook is getting a little stale ( though he may be the last russian leader that gave a shit about living conditions ). got any new material ?
2130,are those instruments a hammer and a sickle ?
2131,putin is a clown
2132,i support the throwing of one trumpet at boris .
2133,- oh yeah ? you and what army ? lol
2134,"i would say "" you feeling big , let's go chump , i'll even give you the first swing and then we'll see what happens """
2135,offer to throw in a lifetimes supply of parkinsons medication if he promises to stop playing with his instruments .
2136,learn to swim .....
2137,![ img](emote|t5_2qqcn|9004 )
2138,patons ghost has entered the chat .
2139,"i'm apologize putin , i forgot you were there . you may go now . for the uninitiated :"
2140,"lol k , what else is new"
2141,sticks and stones ?
2142,lets dance baby dick vlad ! get those dukes up .
2143,they really mean it this time ! for reals !! / s
2144,"they have balalaikas , so there's that ..."
2145,putin : am i the drama ? i dont think i am the drama . mabey i am .
2146,he can keep us scots oot o it . its a javelins and nlwas there getting shipped . no sgian-dubhs ' and claymores
2147,"why is this post okay , but the previous one with exactly the same information was closed ?"
2148,"i know , right lmao . i cannot get over the lack of toilets in russia haha"
2149,they are having a blood stained diarrhea
2150,terrifying . at this stage putins reserve instruments include : the 1st ( grade ) clarinet brigade 4 batallion tactical string quartets 273 long range accordions
2151,i assume putin's favourite instrument is a banjo .
2152,the greatest thing i have ever read .
2153,threatening the world with a supposed super weaponactuallyjust telling the world about the existence of something that any sane nation would classify as beyond top secretis a big brain move only russia could come up with . ![ gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|poop )
2154,hole digging is a technology they hope to have one day ...
2155,"it seems that finally gas stopped flowing ; good riddance , we'll survive without that , and no more euros for these broke bitches"
2156,"the free world met in germany yesterday - apr 26 and said it is over for putin and russia . this was not just nato but israel , australia , kenya , s korea , japan ... this is what we have been waiting for and what putin has been forced to scream about ."
2157,"he knows he can't use the nukes because when he does then sure , at least europe is going to become a nuclear wasteland , but so will russia . britain and france combined already have enough warheads to level every centimeter of russian territory . there will be no place to hide for putler and his goons . not even yamantau or the farthest corners of the far east . the west needs to show him his empty threats are pointless , he should just take his army and fuck off back to mordor ."
2158,"exactly . empty threat after empty threat . as a brit , i honestly hope he does have the stupidity to attack us . would certainly end the war sooner ."
2159,* this is your daily tea break warning from putin .*
2160,"i hope he does something as stupid as attacking nato . it is long over due that ruzzia gets wiped from the map , and split up ."
2161,feb 1982 .
2162,there's probably that one guy in the pentagon foaming at the mouth waiting for putin to give him a reason to do something
2163,"not if you're moldova . my hunch is that this posturing is for moldova . russia may be looking to provoke moldova in some way , then take that as an excuse to --- i don't know what given the crap-condition of their military --- but they could still wreak a hell of a lot of misery on moldova ."
2164,"well yea , many countries have been helping since the first week . what does russia think sanctions are ? food , money , weapons . countries have been supporting ukraine this whole time . the empties of threats ."
2165,i've got a skin flute for him
2166,the on;y proper reaction
2167,** putin is full of himself as usual ** .. ( if he is still sane ) he knows hitting nato directly is a hornet's nest he doesn't want to even get near *.. of course he was dumb enough to invade ukraine from all sides during spring thaw .. so who knows ?*
2168,"we're not intervening you muppet . we're just lending a hand . intervention looks very , very different ."
2169,"it might potentially be more exciting when he finally has action this time ! lets see how the great russian army will fare on two or three or four fronts ! by that time , russian territories will be a free for all !"
2170,when you rattle a saber that doesnt have a blade .
2171,""" who's that speaking here ? is somebody speaking ?"""
2172,the world needs a mute button for russia . no one gives a shit putin .
2173,""" it's less than worthless , my boy !"""
2174,imagine getting the game that early ! we should have had gta 6 11 years ago then
2175,he already committed economical and political suicide for himself and his fellow countrymen .
2176,"wouldnt war ultimately lead to mad . if they dont use nukes first then theyd probably use it last , i dont see russia or putin gracefully losing ."
2177,i respect your optimism sir . but you have no idea in what kind of shambles the german army is . we can throw paper at them and urge them to use umweltzonen-sticker on their tanks but if they ignore us they are in every major city within days .
2178,it's all for his own people . he delivered this to law makers in st petersberg .
2179,the orange scourge . very nice .
2180,we've been at solid negative effectiveness for at least the last month
2181,"basically , put up or shut up . launch a nuke at the us i dare you putin . your cope cave wont save you ."
2182,which part of the western world would you select as the recipient of that russian nuclear strike that would cause the us and nato allies to come in with conventional weapons against russia ?
2183,he's like that one guy there is always present in any gay sauna who loves big cocks . singles out the most hung guy there and ends up with a prolapsed anus . ** begging ** for more even as the integrity of his sphincter collapses into a bloody fecal cum ridden car wreck .
2184,if he nukes nato we're all fucked .
2185,we're all fucked ... just a slow death world wide .
2186,"the cool thing is the us wouldnt need to intervene directly at all . poland could respond with overwhelming disproportionality all on its own . other nato countries , like sweden and finland , would only get sloppy seconds . ( us would still be providing real time intel and imagery regardless )"
2187,"nato will just send unload a few thousand cruise missles to deverstate russian assets from airfields , ports , military bases , munitions , bridges . no need to risk our jet fighters or pilots"
2188,lightning fast like taking kyiv ?
2189,"swift , effective , russia : choose two"
2190,this needs upvoted to the top . for truths sake .
2191,"i confirm he didn't say the word "" strikes "" in his speech ( i speak russian )."
2192,"i'll take the tits , please ."
2193,possibly cutting off the gas pipe ? that could be done pretty quickly . everything else ? who knows .
2194,idk if id call the ukrainian army inferior after the past 2 months ...
2195,this is [ how i imagined those russians ]( being amazed at toilets :)
2196,and no one's even brought up that they don't have poop knives
2197,they are building the new russia![img](emote|t5_2qqcn|9004 )
2198,they steal the toilet seats .
2199,wait til they learn about the three seashells .
2200,and pooping in the corners of buildings they occupy . fucking orcs .
2201,i wonder do those morons even understand how a toilet flush works . the seat itself doesn't do shit ( heh ).
2202,fuck off ! banjos are glorious creations !
2203,and here i pictured him shaking a pair of maracas .
2204,talking about a super-weapon that was going to win the war was a hallmark of nazi propaganda in 1944 .
2205,well it's still following because poland is a transit nation . gas has to go through poland to get to the rest of europe but russia has said if poland filter any of it off for themselves they will deduct it from what europe get
2206,reports are that it's back on as of today
2207,russian gas : go fuck yourself
2208,this should be terrifying for russia .
2209,i hadnt read thisthank you for posting !
2210,"nigeria said they will participate in call-war games against russia . they will initiate tens of thousands of fake wire calls to russia all at once to lower general pop . morale , when the russians finally find out they were scammed"
2211,"has there ever been more nations united against a single enemy , in support of a single nation ? more than ** forty ** countries !"
2212,"it irritates me that a nuclear crisis is in full swing but i still can't read the article because "" my limit has been reached """
2213,"russia is a huge land mass but there are actually very few locations worth wasting a good nuclear warhead on . once moscow , st petersburg , sochi and vladivostok are gone its difficult to find places that dont already look like a post apocalyptic landscape !"
2214,he doesn't even know whether his nukes will work at this point . his regular armed forces were sold in bits and pieces right under his nose . why not the nukes too ?
2215,exactly . man i am really hating him today . fing idiot .
2216,"yeah , fellow brit here . i hope he doesnt decide to foolishly send one flying my way . im busy this weekend and dont fancy cowering in my cellar with the family of mice . that would be a bit of a pisser ."
2217,if he attacks one nato country he wont even have time to press the nuke button . be on that mf like white on rice
2218,tbh with all the corruption and lack of any form of cohesion i actually reckon nuclear war from the russian pov would be like [ this scene from dont look up ]( theyre just watching a screen as each nuke fails
2219,"no one should wish for such stupidity , but no one should also cower from it . putin can shove his nukes up his ass"
2220,is putin making the threats to impress russians like he's doing something ? that's the only rational reason i can think up to make empty threat after empty threat .
2221,"sounds to me like he will have many a country to attack , since the majority of the world is against his illegal and immoral war . let him sling his empty bullshit . the smoke show has ended and he's been seen for what he really is . an impotent weasel with a shoddy and inert military that can't preform at half mass much less totally flaccid ."
2222,"just to continue and further push the help to ukraine , some 40 + countries from all the continents ( not sure on south america ...) have met in rammstein airbase this week . more than 140 countries have already condemned russia's aggression in un . if putin goes nuclear or some other shitty shenanigan , i think the world will pounce on them ."
2223,as a fellow brit . kindve hoping he does and we can waive the whole article 5 thing and take them on ourselves .
2224,you hope we get attacked ? this feels like quite a privileged opinion to hold 
2225,we ( nato ) should have already intervened for that reason
2226,"i hope he won't . you never want to see any nuclear conflict taking place with the west . if nato has been attacked , russia can fire their own icbms and the world will be set on fire . nobody will want this to happen . the last use of nuclear weapons during war took place in world war 2 . we all have heard of the history of hiroshima and nagasaki city , where most people died . you don't want to see another nuclear war taking place at a much bigger scale . the scary part is all of us can die all of a sudden ."
2227,"its actually a bright cold day in april , and the clocks are striking thirteen ."
2228,"maybe early 1500's , sort of depends on who's looking at it ."
2229,"you think ? as an army officer we constantly play suwalki gap at almost every damn exercise . that is the scenario where russia goes to war and invades poland and baltic states . we play it so often i know the best locations for water crossing choke points , airfields how much weight certain bridges can take . time it takes to get stuff from antwerp to warsaw in a convoy . i am not alone . almost everyone plays that war game over and over again . doing it for real would be like taking a shit familiar and satisfying by doing it ."
2230,"theres lots of one guys foaming , im sure . then youve got multiple one guys in combat arms infact , id wager most guys pulling triggers feel it . seeing a worthy hill to die on , finally , after years of bullshit its kind-of trippy ."
2231,one guy ? i would guess lots of guys in the pentagon and prob.what85 % of the us military in total . just chomping at the bit to go kick some russian ass lol
2232,"i think the most eager for something to happen is poland , i mean they will get their revenge if article 5 starts ."
2233,"fun fact , all the us soldiers that have been sent to eastern europe are calling their deployment the "" pre game lobby """
2234,"honestly i've always been pretty critical about the us and mostly their government policy , but damn i have to admit as someone living in a nato-country i'm starting to really appreciate their excessive spending on their military budget . if the us wasn't on our side we'd be fucked ."
2235,it wouldn't surprise me if they have people who's whole job is watching russia
2236,> one guy oh sweatie if only you knew .
2237,"fuck it , if it means having russia eat shit im willing to get drafted . maybe then we can finally put some fear into these shitty ass dictators ."
2238,poland comes to mind .
2239,just keeps his finger on the big red button .
2240,the guys in the f22s probably have 24/7 stiffys thinking of how many air to air kills they'd get if putin fucks around !!!!
2241,his name is john p . militaryindustrialcomplex
2242,i just want to do an experiment! 
2243,"moldova called zelensky . "" make us a part of ukraine !"""
2244,"they are a neutral country , its not for them . its for nato not forgetting sweden and finland . given the state of russias military , a nuclear strike is all they are capable of"
2245,"they want to lose a war in moldova too . first have to get more troops there , they got like 1000 siting ducks there already just ready for someone to get ."
2246,"lemme guess , he promised to make you a colonel ."
2247,i've spent this entire war wishing that a muthafucka would try chuck a missile into poland or one of the baltics . nato would be knocking down the gates of the kremlin in about 3 days flat .
2248,"mad isn't even armageddon for humanity , just a lot of large cities blasted to pieces . greatest tragedy in history but the nations would survive . save for russia - even with nukes they could not stop nato . that would really be the total end of putin's legacy ."
2249,"meh perhaps germany would have issues . but you know , after all the movies on previous wars , just german soldiers shouting nein nein nein at the russians should do it ."
2250,im ready to be fucked .
2251,"nah , most people will be fine . putin , not so much ."
2252,"a small nuke will not cause world wide death . besides , we have every reason to doubt their nukes are performative . i mean , the nukes * could * actually be the one thing that they maintained , but it looks like anything , any bit or part of anything of value in the russian military was sold off long ago ."
2253,the u.s . has a war fetish and just likes to watch
2254,more like choose one .
2255,tattooed tits are nice too
2256,"no way . russia is clearly the 3rd strongest force in ukraine , behind the ukranian army and ukrainian farmers ."
2257,heres a little about how it actually went down lmao .
2258,"wawaweewa you take the poops inside , very nice ."
2259,i was hoping this was that one image of an old british prime minister pointing at a toilet .
2260,one shit at a time
2261,a true manifestation of their shithole country now they have holes to shit
2262,one toilet at a time . every little helps .
2263,nota again please !
2264,yes they absolutely are . but it's also just a funny sounding word .
2265,"europe , just put it on my tab along with the hundreds of millions in heavy equipment ."
2266,side note : if i remember correctly ruzzia will have to pay pipeline transit fee now to poland + maintenance cost fee .
2267,"> well it's still following not for much longer , insallah"
2268,yeah that is random ...
2269,we have seen what happens when a full-on war in the middle of europe breaks out . most of the world - friend or foe does not want that . best to keep it contained in ukraine . they are planning these monthly . i think many more will get on board .
2270,small problem . russians have no money to steal .
2271,"to be fair , when the us invaded afghanistan everybody joined in including india , russia , iran ..."
2272,try this :
2273,"whilst you are correct , it's most certainly surreal to be sitting here reading your words and they aren't some far fetched load of blather , but an increasingly real thing to consider . i was old enough during the latter parts of the cold war to understand the danger ( ever decreasing at that time ) to the whole world but to see even the faintest possibility of nuclear war today is somewhat sobering i have to say . all the best to you and yours and to everyone else ."
2274,"don't forget his bunkers and hidey holes . i'm sure they're keeping tabs on him . he probably doesn't care about most of russia , but he does care about himself and his family ."
2275,"yup , for most russian cities , a nuclear strike would be called urban renewal ."
2276,"you have to consider not only those cities but also russian nuclear submarines and i'm pretty sure they have nuclear bases in siberia . as long as americans know where all these are and as long as some form of anti-icbm was discovered but kept secret by them , then europe stands a chance of not becoming a huge mess ."
2277,i dont have a cellar mister fancy pants cellar owner with the pet mice can i snuggle in . ill promise to breath every other day and bring some baked beans . heinz of course .
2278,i don't have a cellar . the deeds ban cellars ( for good reason we're really near a river and the whole area is an oil pan ). i shall be cowering in my comfy bed .
2279,i just bought a new bbq and want to use it k thx . he just needs to accept he make a that move a d it's time to give it up . ukraine isn't his . no.one is invading russia . so fuck off home
2280,you're lucky . i dream of cowering in a basement . all i have is shoebox in middle ' o road to wait out the big one .. :-)
2281,does he not know how defences work ?
2282,"in that case , germany is going to be nothing but a nuclear wasteland , and ill be dust . but fuck it , id rather be dust tomorrow than entertain that barbarian motherfucker in the kreml ."
2283,zactly god hes fing stupid af
2284,[ and we will all end up like this ](
2285,"well as a british person sat in my british flat in britain , and nowhere near any war , i feel like i am probably in quite a privileged position to have that opinion ."
2286,"right ? everyone calling for us to go in and fuck russia up has absolutely no fucking clue what theyre asking for . they may be incompetent tactically , and their military is incredibly outdated , but they also have the ability to incinerate every man , woman , and child in the western world . this shit cant just be brushed aside , even if its a bluff it has to be taken seriously ."
2287,"> you never want to see any nuclear conflict taking place with the west . and i believe you still wouldn't under those circumstances . even the world's craziest people have avoided nuclear war , and it takes more than one man to push the button ."
2288,"> the scary part is all of us can die all of a sudden . you are overestimating russia's nuclear capabilities . sure there are some real scary scenarios , but there are practical limits to how many missiles and bombs they can fire . nuclear war is scary enough , no need for hyperbole ."
2289,"alas , due to rationing i have but one upvote to give ."
2290,this sounds interesting . can i have some sauce ?
2291,this gives me great comfort .
2292,"good , i am so glad you are ready ."
2293,"well that's a bit of a bugger , seeing as how he's gone via ukraine instead . do your scenarios cover him missing poland out at first ?"
2294,everybody in the pentagon sitting there like [ dennis ]( waiting for the go ahead to light some shit up .
2295,"when 80 % of the general u.s . population thinks a direct military intervention is both justified and will not result in nuclear armageddon , you can only imagine what the military percentage is , especially among the enlisted men where they won't hold any formal culpability if they make the wrong decision . when they smell blood in the water , military men would rather devour the prey than let it swim away . to a certain extent it's even the most moral action to decapitate an enemy regime than to allow its people to suffer under its lies and economic sanctions ."
2296,"this situation is literally the situation drilled into every soldier's head . fighting for freedom both domestic and abroad , and in this case it's not the slightest bit unclear . the only big problem we'd have in the us is the marines and army deciding who gets to go first ."
2297,we were born and raised for this shit.......please give us an excuse to fuck you up putin . enough of this fucking around ......
2298,"i believe it's called "" getting some ""."
2299,probably 95 % of our old ass politicians having ussr flash backs and dementia raging about commie pinkos trying to take over the world .
2300,"poland and finland sitting there like "" dont threaten us with a good time !"""
2301,you have no idea . ;\^)
2302,"> people who's whole job is watching russia significant resources are allocated to this task , certainly billions of dollars a year !"
2303,it's pretty obvious they do
2304,no fooling you . =)
2305,it's about time for alaska to claim a lot more territory
2306,"thats fucked up man . putin by all means but civilians are not legitimate targets , ever ."
2307,"russia doesn't consider them neutral , but a buffer zone . russians have already stated their intention to roll over moldova . it's possible they're just looking for an excuse . if moldova calls in ukraine due to a "" provocation "" by transnistria separatists , russia would absolutely call that a country intervening in their war . they would do to moldova what they're just itching to do to nato ."
2308,that's not how mad works .
2309,even when you survive this crap rest assured that your life will change drastically . better to sit right inside one of the blast radiuses .
2310,"you dont understand the implications of using even a small nuke ... that would just bring alot if country to enter war and maybe also use nuke . people are not scare about "" a small nuke "" ... they are afraid of the response from nato ... if russia use nuke and is enemy also start to using nuke , it gonna be a snowball effect leading to a nuclear winter killing the majority of people on the globe ... i dont understand how people still think that a small nuke would do nothing to the world ..."
2311,"100 %, although i prefer not to see any nuclear weapons deployed ever . i do think that the risk is overstated . i am not certain of russia's current nuclear readiness or capabilities . i know that on paper , they represent a significant nuclear threat . what is certain is that the united states maintains significant nuclear readiness and capability . russia knows this too . the us spends $ 40b per year in upgrading and maintaining their nuclear weapons capabilities . i have a hard time believing that russia has invested anything close to what the us has or that the rampant corruption we've seen evidenced in the atrocious readiness of their conventional forces doesn't also apply to their nuclear forces . the united states has invested trillions of dollars over the last 70 years on detecting increased potential or likelihood for a first strike by russia or her soviet predecessor . it is an obsession and paranoia deeply ingrained in nearly every layer of government . it is the primary reason the nsa , cia , and dia exist . we have expertise in that area . if you contrast the apocalyptic ramblings of various russian spokesholes with the utter silence and calm resolved tone of us , five eyes nations , nato , and the eu , it doesn't take a genius to see that they aren't panicking . that's revealing . while they certainly wouldn't dare russia to act or amp up the rhetoric in response , don't you think if they saw an actual threat , they would be acting differently ?"
2312,"the smallest tactical warhead russia has is bigger than the kt load of the one dropped on nagasaki . you don't seem to understand these weapons or how easily escalation can happen . it's not the effects of that one warhead that endanger the planet , it's what happens after that ."
2313,""" yeah that's it get that 155mm in there .... yeah nice and tight ... ok here's some javelins you like that huh ? oh yeh that's it pop those t90 turrets as high as you can ... keep going going i'm about to come """
2314,usa just sitting in the closet at an orgy of war lol
2315,not my thing but i respect your opinion .
2316,wwwwait wait wait wait wait .... at the end of the video...did she say ... russians were bringing fucking toilets outside expecting them to work not connected to the plumbing ?
2317,high five ! 
2318,"this made me think of the song "" one piece at a time "" by johnny cash ! may be their new anthem !"
2319,"says it all when he threatens nuclear war , posters talk about toilets . really shows no one cares what putin says ."
2320,every little shit helps !
2321,i heard that ukraine supplies much of their wheat .
2322,i think its a show of solidarity against growing chinese influence in developing african nations .
2323,"kenya is also a democracy ; a flawed one , to be sure , but they still take their form of government very seriously . similar to ukraine , in that regard ."
2324,"subs are pretty hard to keep track of or find which is why they're so important to countries . many of them home ports for submarines are bunkers that they can leave submerged from to add further complication . the anti-icbm capabilities are not really secret , the best is the aegis middle systems on our guided missile destroyers . i remember there were proposals to put in land based missile defense systems in poland and czech republic back in the early 2000s to counter iran and north korea but putin flipped his lid . actually just went to look that up - aegis land installations are in poland and romania i don't know how many threats they can handle . hopefully we don't have to find out ."
2325,oh the mice arent pets . theyre squatters .
2326,branston beans or nothing .
2327,do you cower in the bed or should it be under the bed ?
2328,"there is something to say of the dictator trap these guys fall in . after decades of ruling through fear and getting rid of anyone who does not automatically agree with every idea the despot spits out , they are caught in a bubble of their own making with little connection to reality . he may well honestly think russia could defeat the entire world combined with how great a military his commanders tell him they have . for example , a general in charge who suggests they could possibly lose to an opponent is more likely to be disposed of , rather then listened to for careful consideration . how dare they suggest we are anything but perfect ."
2329,\* looks at russian military in ukraine \* i'm guessing their defense works about as well as their offense ...
2330,"and as a transplanted texan sitting in my oklahoma dining room playing on the computer , and nowhere near any war , i second this . at this precise moment what are all ya'll out there doing ?"
2331,"in your imagination , what stops russia going full nuclear armageddon when your "" frighteningly overwhelming conventional response "" starts ?"
2332,"i dont have any sauce , but you may share some of my victory gin and have a victory cigarette if its your pleasure ."
2333,1984
2334,it gets better . we have been training the ukrainian military since 2014 . teaching them everything the russians suck at . teaching them how to have strong ncos how to make decisions at the lowest and highest levels . how the russian army has a top 10 % well equipped army the rest are garbage . hit their logistics grind down the top soldiers till they are sending in barely trained conscripts with shitty mothballed equipment . then you can win .
2335,i am sure that has been played also . mine were always he causes shit somewhere then decides to invade the baltics then bridge between belorussian and kallingrad . i think he would still try that . going all the way through ukraine would mean he would not have any tanks left for us to destroy .
2336,marines from the east and army from the west sounds fair .
2337,cue starcraft 2 suit up scene .
2338,i got a keen eye me ;)
2339,"i never said anything about how russia perceived moldova . its fairly obvious that russia wanted to roll over ukraine , straight into moldova . wouldn't surprise me if they were going to turn north while trying to hold nato back with the threat of nukes . moldova only has a population of 2 or 3 million people ."
2340,it's amazing . these countries are there for protection against russia ! we don't like russia . go home and stay there !
2341,"there is a reasonable likelihood that some of those russian warheads are not maintained , not functional . there is a reasonable likelihood that some of those russian missiles will fail to launch there is a reasonable likelihood that the missiles will go off course , fail to hit targets on the other hand , us missiles are maintained , functional and will land with devastating effectiveness . just one leg of the nuclear triad is subs . the us maintains 14 ohio class submarines , the so called boomers . each sub can have up to 20 trident ii d5 missiles . each missile can have up to 14 independently targeted warheads . the yield for each warhead can be selected , but is limited at 475,000 tons . hiroshima , for perspective is 13,000 tons . 142014475,000 tons = 3,724,000,000,000 pounds of explosive yield . for our sumerian friends , that's 3 cubits . of course , united kingdom and france also maintain icbms , those are not included . the us also maintains land based icbms , not included . the us also maintains a fleet of strategic nuclear bombers , not included ."
2342,"ok so we are to believe that after or while we are sending nukes to russia , they are going to be able to send out enough nukes , that actually function , to many different countries ? you certainly have more faith in the russian military than i do . also , just because they can fire a nuke doesnt mean that it will detonate as intended . that takes regular maintenance of highly sensitive and very valuable elements ."
2343,"yes , although i do not think the us would let the public know unless they absolutely had too or it was just obvious . they do a lot of preventive stuff that doesnt come to light until well after the fact . but i do think the us is well aware of its own capabilities and aware of the capabilities of other nations , and you are right that there is a stark contrast in the squawking of putin compared to the steely resolve of america ."
2344,"putin : what about nuclear war? america : please stop , i can only get so erect! "
2345,yikes . i'm tagging your comment as a war crime .
2346,plumbing is basically magic to us mortals . 
2347,"the craziest thing about this isn't the fact that russians didn't have this in their rural homes . many people in the us are on well water and septic systems , and i reckon a few even still use outhouses . it's the fact that they were in the army , sitting on the ukrainian border , for * months *, and still haven't even heard of a flush toilet . like , in their half a year of service , even their military bases were lacking this basic function . our most rural bases in alaska , north dakota , louisiana , oklahoma , and even the dry ass desert of california have this . i doubt there is a single canadian or australian base that is lacking flush toilets . i get that russia is huge , but even a local electric station can provide the power for a water pump that pulls well water . and unless you are putting your bases in the middle of siberia , there is no reason for your troops to not know about a flush toilet ."
2348,there you go ...
2349,wouldnt want to come off as bougie now would we ?
2350,"fuck it , i'll take my chances with the mutants"
2351,i'm too fat for under the bed . and there's not enough time to change that .
2352,"> general in charge who suggests they could possibly lose to an opponent is more likely to be disposed of , rather then listened to for careful consideration . how dare they suggest we are anything but perfect . this is super close but i think there's a tad more to it . if you've ever had a shitty boss or a shitty teacher then you already understand this . these people in authority assume it's the subordinate's fault when the subordinate's task isn't up to their code . it couldn't * possibly * be the leader's fault for failing to support the subordinate . so if the general comes forward and says things are shit , putin will assume that's because the general made it that way , either through incompetence or intentional sabotage . just like the teacher that says "" these kids refuse to learn "" instead of looking in the mirror , or the boss that says "" nobody wants to work "" without examining their own performance ."
2353,what stops russia from doing it tomorrow ? the world can't keep cowering in fear every time putin or his lapdogs go on tv waving their nuclear stick . nato needs to go in to ukraine and help end these atrocities . fuck putin's feelings .
2354,putin doesn't have an armageddon button on his desk . armageddon requires the cooperation and coordination of dozens of high ranking officials . that's what stops it .
2355,thats great . you guys are the fucking best .
2356,"we read a lot about how our officers are different from the russian ones in their ability to take initiative . it's all founded on things like this . thanks for the great example , and your service . this is an incredible intangible asset . i so happy that ru officers in ukraine don't have this knowledge and they keep having to expose their senior military instead . feels like our generals would have almost nothing to do in comparison . all the hard work was in preparation ."
2357,"it's ok , hungary would just hand theirs over"
2358,"i was thinking more "" generation kill "". but i'm sure both work quite well ."
2359,i'm making sarcastic jokes because that's what redditors do . don't read into it too much
2360,"it's small , perfect for the bullying russkies ."
2361,how russia perceives moldova is all that matters .
2362,"the u.k . used to have a triad . i think we just use subs and small bombers now . we used to have the mighty vulcan . a bomber that twice outsmarted our us friends in an exercise called operation sky shield 1 and 2 if you saw that delta winged screaming beast coming toward you , youd surely have to get your affairs in order ."
2363,"you think nato nuking russia would not have any effect on the world climate , food production , economie , etc ? your delusional ."
2364,"whatever reasonable likelihood there is , no one is going to call putin's bluff on this . plus , this is not the us's war . money , yes , weapons , yes , humanitarian aid , yes , but the whole ' here come the heroes guns ablaze to save the day ' attitude is maybe better left on * that * side of the atlantic , for once , thank you very much . \-- europe ."
2365,we have seen the damage their missiles have done in ukraine . zero reason to believe they lack the capability with their stockpile of nukes . even if most were not maintained it only takes a handful per country to send the world to shit .
2366,"well russia have 6000 nuke ... even if one 1 % only is lauch , that would do alot of damage . dont forget they have nuke in submarine and plane , not just icbm . i dont believe in russia ability , i'm questioning the ability of nato to stop even 1 % of the russia nuke ."
2367,"i do not wish to get into too much politics , especially united states politics , but this is an area where i'm particularly glad that trump is not in office . regardless of how you feel about him , it's hard to imagine that he wouldn't take the bait and escalate things unnecessarily and unhelpfully . i think the current us approach is best summed up by an expression my mother uses : *"" never wrestle with a pig ; you both get dirty and the pig likes it .""*"
2368,they keep me up at night with their loud music !
2369,to add some things just cant work and failure and non starting should be more accepted .
2370,really good insight and share .
2371,""" how do i reach these keeds ?!"""
2372,"when i was in the marine corps , it was drilled into us from boot through my four years in an infantry unit , that we needed to be prepared to lead the platoon as commander , and company co if ever necessary . right from its ( we used to call it infantry training school ) i was expected to learn and understand my fireteam leader's role , squad leader's role , section leader's role ( when i was in weapons platoon ) and platoon sergeant . when gps first came out i fucked around and figured out how to call in a medivac with the damn thing and next thing i know , they had me doing company clerk . before long i was attending battalion meetings with the co ( ltcol ) and sgt major and recommending people for promotions and recognition . people like to think the us military trains us all to be yes men and women , but it is a lot more complicated than that . when junior enlisted made solid effort but something did not work out , we were not berated . not by the good leaders , anyway . what i heard would be , "" good initiative , marine . bad judgment !"" during jungle training in okinawa , our unit was learning how to set up and how to respond to being in an ambush . one dude kept asking , "" why ? why should i turn into the fire and assault and not hit the deck or hide ?"" no matter how many times he asked why and no matter how many times something was explained , he had a new why or why not this ...? he was promoted to nco for that . why ? the co liked that he was willing to challenge doctrine and eventually able to fully integrate it and understand the why . the co wanted him to be an example to the rest of us . i think it is this sort of awareness that makes it hard to defeat us on the battlefield . it helps too , that 35 years later , and my training kicks in in unexpected ways . especially in violent or potentially life and death situations , of which i have had lots . this is probably not unique to us forces . it is likely most forces in democratic societies have this sort of expectation and latitude . the reason is because our leadership does not need to fear us . not our military leadership and not our governmental leadership . there is no way putler or china could allow such intellectually free-thinking and capable subordinates . their regimes would never survive ."
2373,"ours make and own the big decisions . where to attack when , talk to our civilian politicians on what can and cannot be done . when to stop and advise to ask for peace . critically the russians have not asked for peace and what they can throw into the mix now gets worse and worse . conscripts , older equipment soldiers that have been defeated once . now we are sending them western artillery with guided munitions . things could start to go very badly for russian artillery once those come on line ."
2374,when the doom music kicks in
2375,"like ukraine , part of russia ."
2376,i know the vulcan !
2377,well enthusiasts have brought a vulcan back to the skies ...
2378,"depends on how many nukes and their yields . either way , russia wont be russia ever again ."
2379,russia go boom
2380,"the uk on their own can handle russias military , im sure . im also sure the us would love a piece of russias ass lol"
2381,"this is russia's war of aggression against ukraine . all of us are doing what we can to make sure russia fails miserably . together . all of us . putin makes another pathetic threat . there is 0.0 % likelihood of putin using his strategic weapons , for precisely the reason i indicated above . if he does , russia go boom ."
2382,"they have to get these nukes off while they are being nuked though , or at least bombed . yes as i said the missiles might fire just fine . that does not mean the nuke itself will detonate as it should . i would think a lot of the valuable bits of the nukes were sold off . thats how their military makes money , thats how deep the corruption goes . i mean , maybe they have functional nukes that they can also fire while being bombarded , but again , you seem to see some kind of functional military in the russians that that im just not seeing ."
2383,"russia has around 1600 actively operating , 1 % of that is 16 . modern air defense systems would blow them out of the sky edit : spelling"
2384,"well if they didnt maintain the nukes , they are not going to function properly . if they sold off the valuable parts of the nukes , the are not going to function properly . the missile might fire . that doesnt mean the nuke will explode as it should or even at all . even if they have usable , functional nukes , they are going to have to get them off while they themselves are under fire . are they organized enough to do that ? we are not seeing any evidence of that . other countries have nuclear submarines and planes too , and i can guarantee you that the us ones have been properly maintained with a well functioning crew . so russia is going to have to try to counter strike against a very strategic and well equipped enemy and we have every reason to doubt that they can do that ."
2385,"i dont think that would happen because i think trump would be aiding putin in the current war in ukraine . it is possible that he would have had boots on the ground for putin , unless the us military commanders refused such orders . yes it is a very , very good thing he is not in office and we are fucked if he gets back in there , or any other american politician who is a putin sympathizer or in putins pocket"
2386,put them to work ! ratatouille !
2387,"absolutely , but authoritarians don't see the world that way . there are geniuses , like them , and then there are idiots ( people beneath them ) who can't get anything done . and they believe this is why they are in a position of authority , and they believe they know best because obviously they do otherwise they wouldn't be in a position of authority ."
2388,"how has nato not directly intervened ?? ukraine was trained by nato , armed by nato , using nato intelligence and joined by tons of "" volunteer "" nato soldiers on the battlefield ? russia already knows they are fighting nato that's why they keep whining about it . all of this dithering about "" escalation "" is pointless . we have already crossed 10 of putin's "" red lines ."""
2389,"ha ha ha ha no , what stops putin is the knowledge that russia would disappear , while large parts of the rest of the world would live on ."
2390,that fancy drone jammer gun does look like a bfg
2391,gorgeous isnt it ?
2392,"its not . its in a special hangar . it can taxi but it wont fly again , unfortunately . my names on its wing ."
2393,putin can wave his tiny nuclear penis around all he wants . . 
2394,"the vatican can probably handle russia , right now . ( not the point , however )"
2395,do you think nuke take a whole week to be lauched ?
2396,no modern air defense systems would not take them down by any means .
2397,"while i'm no fan of trump , i think rumors of his ties to putin are overstated and in some cases , wholly fabricated for political gain . regardless , there's no scenario where trump would have had the courage to stand against ukraine and with russia . i see the opposite : exacerbating and complicating the delicate diplomacy through irresponsible rhetoric ."
2398,sounds suspiciously like trump .
2399,"there is a big difference between proxy wars and sending troops on the ground . during ww2 many smaller countries supported allied countries but they weren't considered combatants because they didn't have any troops fighting in ww2 . the same was true for the axis , a lot of middle eastern countries supported them but they didn't have any troops fighting for them in an official capacity besides volunteer ss units ."
2400,a week ? wtf are you even talking about ?
2401,why not ? what difference are they to missiles ?
2402,his presidential campaign manager was paul manafort . a man who worked for the russian oligarchs before joining trump's team . he then fired manafort ( along with many many other of his friends ) when the heat picked up . trump is in bed with these creeps . if he were in office he may have already removed the usa from nato .
2403,"he already did stand against ukraine and with russia . he was impeached for it . the republicans , after the impeachment trial , said the the democrats had proved their case ( and therefore trump was guilty ), but that they just were not going to vote against a sitting president of their party . so there were not enough votes to find him guilty . how many of those people in congress were in moscow on the 4th of july ? how many of them have ties to russia ? trump is in debt to putin for $ 400million . putin literally owns him ."
2404,"there's a lot of people like that . the problem is a lack of introspection . in fact , i'd wager that the * majority * of people , if placed in a very high position of power ( even relatively , like being manager of a burger king ) will let confirmation bias do the rest . it's a simple thought process : * this job is only for the best * i have this job * i am therefore the best * no one else has this job * no one else is as good as me . and there you have it ."
2405,your defeatist attitude is what enables putin to bully .
2406,well you talk like if we attack first russia wont ever have time to counter attack .
2407,"the going into space , dividing up into multiple warheads and the re-entry to earth's atmosphere and their insanely rapid descent in great numbers is what makes them "" different "" to missiles . they are icbms , not cruise missiles or small ballistic missiles . still , i hope the bigger powers on our side in the world do indeed have the capability to stop them but i don't know ."
2408,"i'm an independent , so no dog in the hunt , but if you or i owed somebody $ 400m and had a chance to wipe it out using the 82nd airborne , i'm guessing we'd be sorely tempted , especially if we had - putting it kindly - the same moral flexibility as trump . i didn't find the impeachment case particularly compelling . yeah , he leaned on zelenskyy , but that was to benefit himself politically , not trying to punish ukraine or benefit putin . regardless , we could debate the asshat all day and we'd probably enjoy it , but i'm happy enough that he's not in office . anything else that happens to him , i couldn't possibly care less ."
2409,that number seems way to low
2410,surely the real figure is way higher than that ?....
2411,and how many did they kidnap
2412,"fucking rusian murderers . i live here in ukraine . i was born and raised near rusian border . in 2014 rusia attacked us . i left my home town as soon as i could . and here we are , february 2022 . now they want me to leave my new home again . i used to travel a lot . all the cities you see in the news , all the bombings and crimes you hear about freaking tears my heart . ive been in or near majority of cities and towns these monsters destroyed . often i see the news of their bombing and think of people i knew from that town , friends who lived there , family i had there , that specific turn the road in that city makes that i remember , grocery i used to buy snacks in that town etc etc i have so many memories and fucking rusia took them away . covered my fucking memories in blood . i hate rusia so much . there will never be anything civil between us . and ill make sure my kids hate rusia as much as i do . and special hate goes for people in rusia who approve this , do not condemn , comply , those who do nothing to stop this horror ."
2413,"it makes no sense 1 person dies because of putin's interests , let alone thousands , all humans are equal"
2414,they haven't counted occupied or wiped out cities ( mariupol ) behind enemy lines . the mass graves implied a much larger number .
2415,that seems really low considering how much indiscriminate bombing and shelling russia have been doing .
2416,"sadly , that number will be much higher . the west cannot compromise and give up any ukrainian land to russias illegal war ."
2417,i thought it was closer to bungie
2418,"and everyone else just let it happen , and will let it keep happening . what a wonderful world ."
2419,"it's not putin's war ! it's russia's war ! never forget that . russians strongly support this war , all of them are responsible ."
2420,"this is the best tl;dr i could make , [ original ]( reduced by 82 %. ( i'm a bot ) ***** > russia's ongoing war in ukraine has taken a steep toll on the country's young residents , according to new figures released friday . > in a telegram post , ukrainian prosecutor general iryna venediktova said juvenile prosecutors have determined that 343 children had died as a result of russia's months-long assault on her country . > venediktova's office , as well as ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky and some u.s . officials , has also accused russian troops of committing war crimes in ukraine . ***** [** extended summary **]( | [ faq ]( "" version 2.02 , ~ 657520 tl;drs so far ."") | [ feedback ]( "" pm's and comments are monitored , constructive feedback is welcome ."") | * top * * keywords *: ** war**^1 ** russia**^2 ** office**^3 ** ukraine**^4 ** crime**^5"
2421,"yep , comments were just as i expected"
2422,"reminder , that this number is higher than the number of civilians of all ages dead on both sides of the conflict in the donbass region since 2016 till 2022 ."
2423,yeah .. i think you can add a few 0's after that number . .\ _ .
2424,"how many iraqi children died during american/iraqi war ? or is that forgotten ? im sure the count is 4x the amount posted here . dont get me wrong , i have no love for putin , but titles like this read from people who remembered make it less effective , and somewhat insulting ."
2425,obama killed way more in the middle east
2426,"russian soldiers aren't an army , they are a zombie horde . they don't do tactics , maneuvers or surgical strikes . they just send wave after wave of cannon fodder , of poorly armed and unwilling slaves , raised from poor russian provinces to die for their master . and whatever civilians get caught by the zombie horde face death , torture and concentration camps ."
2427,"dont wanna throw shade here but the us has much higher numbers dont really think we get to say anything at all on our end nor does the rest of the world honestly for not condemning our actions . honestly , were fucked as a whole world . were all bad people ."
2428,my god . the war crimes with this man are fucking crazy
2429,"its not related , but how many kids did the usa kill in iraq and afghanistan ? what russia is doing is wrong and awful , but i think its super ironic that america shits on russia for doing similar things ."
2430,"satan has a very , very special place in hell for putin ."
2431,israel has killed more children than that in palestine .
2432,one more thing american warmongers have in common with him .
2433,"just to put this in prospective , in the iraq war , us troops killed somewhere between 184k and 207k civilians , meaning men women and children"
2434,as an american i say those numbers are low .
2435,and even more in syria ...
2436,ha ha . how many did us killed in afghanistan . please enlighten us .
2437,planned parenthood is stoked
2438,wait until you hear about planned parenthood ...
2439,"kind of negligible compared to the 200,000 that zelensky says were abducted . ... or did he misspeak on that occasion ?"
2440,"you said putin war ?? why !! i really want to know if you are so blind that you can't see what is really happening , and why this operation in the donbas is taking place . a dog doesn't bite if you don't corner him"
2441,"only dumb ukrainians here let's save the children of palestine , ho no i forgot they are not white whit blue eyes f ...... ukraine"
2442,"it's the confirmed number . mariupol's civilian deaths for example will be in the thousands and will include a lot of children but they can't report accurate numbers until they liberate it . look at the liberation of bucha , at what we know about mariupol , the theater alone was 600 people and lots of those children , and you can imagine what this figure will be when regions are liberated and the full scale discovered . edit : suggests russia has killed 20k civilians just in mariupol , you can guess at how many of those will be kids but it certainly won't be only in the hundreds . this number is going to be much bigger . absolutely heart breaking ."
2443,"it does , but i hope it's true . around the world , 10,000 + children die of starvation every single day . that's mind-blowing to me . not sure why i looked that up ."
2444,"fortunately many children have been evacuated , but the number of dead is likely more than this"
2445,this is useless trivia but thats the exact same number of emergency responders who lost their lives in 9/11 .
2446,i'd think thousands by now
2447,"well , they've also kidnapped over 100k of them ."
2448,compare that to obama's drone strikes
2449,no they're 30 times as valuable
2450,"[ 40 % of all civilian casualties from airstrikes in afghanistan almost 1,600 in the last five years were children ]( > between 2016-2020 ( inclusive ) there have , in afghanistan , been : > 3,977 total civilian casualties from airstrikes : 2,122 civilians killed , 1,855 civilians injured > 1,598 total child casualties from airstrikes : 785 children killed , 813 children injured > 40 % of all civilian airstrike casualties were children ( 1,598 of 3,977 ) how about we hold ourselves responsible ?"
2451,happy cake day !
2452,"yes , should we stop counting ?"
2453,almost like the bombing and shelling hasn't really been indiscriminate ...
2454,"a good friend of mine is a former us marine . when zelenskyy put out the call for foreign volunteers , he raised his hand . i talked to him about it before he left , and he said he'd already fought a war that was morally ambiguous at best . he needed to fight a righteous war . he's still in ukraine now . i talk to him about twice a week . and he's told me about some of the abhorrent shit he's seen . based on his testimony to me , the number of 343 is far too low . he's looking to come home soon , because he's definitely at his limit . the level of death and destruction he's seen is so much worse than either iraq or afghanistan . my heart breaks for ukraine . i wish i could go over there and help , but right now they need fighters , and i'm not equipped for that . but when this is done i will absolutely be going there to help rebuild . that's one thing i can actually be a help with . fuck russia . slava ukraini . "
2455,"i get what youre saying , but whether ukraine compromises or not , is the decision of the ukranian people . they are the ones suffering , fighting , and dying ."
2456,fucking thank you . 81 % of the russian population supports the war and telegram is absolutely full of comments and entire groups cheering on the slaughter of ukrainian civilians . enough of this putins war bullshit its russias war .
2457,4x is quite an underestimation .
2458,how many ?
2459,"> but the us has much higher numbers if we wanna dwell on the past , we can always go into the soviet occupation of afghanistan ( far more brutal than the us one ). or to the stalin period ? or to the russian empire ?"
2460,whataboutthis at its best .
2461,"george bush jr be like "" these are rookie numbers , gotta pump them up "" / whataboutism ."
2462,so i assume you think this is bad news too then
2463,"so youre saying i cant care about these children , because loss of life has happened to others ? think"
2464,no one is saying one life is worth less than another . youre the one making a faulty conclusion
2465,what do you mean ?
2466,it's crazy how a chronic lack of a girlfriend has left some men completely clueless about what planned parenthood does .
2467,what a tragedy . the war criminals in the russian army must be put on trial for this .
2468,spoiler : it's not true
2469,indeed . all murders should be investigated .
2470,horrific stuff . terrible to think about . no one with a brain disagrees with it . however . stay on topic and don't throw some whataboutism around to stave off the conversation on horrific war crimes russia is committing daily . edit : would ya look at that ? a post history filled with pro-russian propaganda . my bad for biting the bait .
2471,"oh fuck off , whats the point in this comment ? what should we do ? not care about russia ? tell me lol"
2472,"in the immortal words of richard nixon , when he tried to deflect reporters from a subject , ' let me say this about that ...' at which point he'd go on to an unrelated topic . two wrongs don't make a right , and just because the us killed civilians doesn't make it ok for putin to do so ."
2473,yeah but none of those were european so .
2474,love that theyre downvoting you for straight facts . people dont like the truth when its about this subject .
2475,"wonder what the stats are for iraq . you know , the thing eerily similar to current events ."
2476,"why are you one of these people that is obsessed with going "" butwhataboutamerica !?!?!?!?"" can you shut the fuck up about your shit obnoxious country for a second ? this is about ukraine not usa ."
2477,"you don't post very often , so you seem to be a real person . this was a rather rational comment , but why don't you see that this is just deflection ? ukraine is happening right now . those 350 kids died this year . more will die . afghanistan was worse , but it's over ."
2478,"you can't analyze things in a vacuum . the western allies alone in ww2 killed probably more than 1 million civilians , and they were undeniably the good guys , are you gonna quote that every time some other war happens ? you have to take into account the type of war you're fighting , whether it's a just cause or not , and what kind of enemy you have and the measures he forces you to take . to compare the ukrainian government with the taliban - an entity that in several years of the war in afghanistan caused ** over 80 % of the civilian ** casualties in that conflict ( - there's a fact so-called anti-imperialists never seem to quote !! - is frankly disgraceful ."
2479,this isnt even related to what the article is about . thats a whole separate issue
2480,astonishing .. this remark gets - 17 ? why ? is a kid killed by americans worth less than a kid killed by russians ? this is absurd .
2481,well wishes to you my friend . heroiam slava !
2482,hahahahahahahahaha
2483,"usually it's nice to say this , but that was a bad comment to reply to saying it ."
2484,have some fucking class
2485,right sediment wrong timing
2486,"go away lol , the entire world fucking hates all of you . you fucking pussies need to stand up to your dumb cunt leader ."
2487,"> indiscriminate : done at random or ** without careful judgement **. most russian strikes might be motivated at striking military facilities , the problem is that they completely disregard the collateral damage such strikes might inflict ."
2488,""" "" ohchr believes that the actual figures are considerably higher """
2489,"at least he has a home to return to . it is very brave to go and help the ukrainians defend their own homes . the whole thing is so tragic but i'm happy to know that there are people who deeply care--deeply enough to put their own lives at risk . if you want to do something at home , see what the local ukrainian church needs in your community . i know ours is collecting things for people who have fled the country to stay with relatives in the us ."
2490,"ukraine is fantastic . cant wait for people around the world to see my country with their own eyes . and you , my friend , you are absolutely welcome here ! thanks for your support in this dark time . every kind word means a lot to us ."
2491,they will only compromise if the west fails to support them .
2492,between 10000 to 17000 people between 800 to 1700 thought to be civilian by us analysis but unofficial number is way high between 5000 to 7000 civilians .
2493,yes but this isnt such a past that were still there . i love our military but we straight up wrecked numerous countries for inappropriate reasons
2494,it's always whataboutism with you sick fucks
2495,i mean the shit is happening concurrently why does it upset you to mention other children being murdered by their occupiers ?
2496,maybe it isnt whataboutism if yall had the sense to see war is for profit 9 times out of 10 .
2497,yes . i am tired of people thinking war is an answer .
2498,obvious
2499,the war criminals in american british french etc should be brought to justice because i will never forget one million irakien killed for nothing and that's why julian assange is going to spent all is life in jail
2500,"how come you're not advocating for us assets to be seized ? why is the us allowed to kill a few hundred thousand more than russia and get a free pass ? "" whataboutism "" is an american's only defense when confronted with their astoundingly tone deaf hypocrisy . the us and russia aren't on equal footing - the us is [ demonstrably and unequivocally ]( an even worse cancer on the world when it comes to civilian deaths from conflict and invasion . where was all this outrage of yours hiding prior to this spring ?"
2501,"maybe hold your own country and politicians accountable ? i'm willing to bet you 100 % back seizing the assets of russians , punishing all russian citizens with economic sanctions and wishing all sorts of strife of them , but don't even have a shred of self awareness to consider the actions of the us . all this manufactured outrage over what really amounts to a fraction of the death , destruction , destabilisation and misery that western nations and the us in particular have caused in the last two decades . if russia killing ~ 300 kids and however many thousands of other civilians are war crimes , and all of russia should be published , and putin is basically hitler ... ... what price should the us pay for the hundred thousand plus dead in the middle east ? where does that fall on the war crimes scale ? coalition airstrikes killed more than double the amount of children everyone is up in arms about in the last five years of afghanistan . how come you're not advocating for raytheon executives to have their assets seized , or boeing shareholders to have their yachts seized and auctioned ? where have you been ? seems like it's only "" abhorrent war crimes "" when its another country doing it , because the us is directly responsible for 10x the civilian deaths that russia is ."
2502,"well , hypocrisy and bias to certain people are in play here . that's pretty important ."
2503,"who said it was okay for russia ? you seemed pretty wrapped up in russia , whilst giving your own country a free pass . if russia killing a few thousand civilians is "" genocide "", what pray tell does that make the hundreds of thousands dead as a result of the us invasions ?"
2504,"how does the us hold russia accountable to a higher standard than ourselves though ? as a person who was anti iraq and afghanistan both i can post all the justified rants i want against putin , but as an american i feel i have no ground to stand on and judge russia after just our recent past ."
2505,"the west help create terrorists , and frankly who can blame them , when other people are held to different moral standards than we hold ourselves to . it gives people a legitimate reason to support other countries who are just as bad ( if it's okay to support america despite such atrocities going unpunished , it's no worse to support russia ) or support countries going to war with the west ."
2506,hes being downvoted because hes doing what yanks always do on reddit . trying to change the topic back to america . these people literally think america is the only country on earth . not everything has to do with you lot . nobody gives a shit .
2507,"200k civilians were killed . obama even redefined militant to be any adult aged male in range of a drone strike . they also bombed weddings and funerals , and possibly even took out water supplies at the start of the war ."
2508,"it's over lol ? after twenty years . so after russia stops invading ukraine you'll just forget about all of this , right ?"
2509,"but its over , so it must be forgotten ? people are quick to jump to conclusions when its russia , but yell freedom when its america . weird ."
2510,there is no bad timing only bad attitude
2511,"who is the entire world , eu and the us . that's not even half of the world "
2512,to be fair how did america kill 200k civilians in iraq if they regarded the collateral damage their strikes might inflict ? remind me what sanctions america faced ? which companies left america ?
2513,"oh ok , that must be why the number of innocent civilians killed is so much lower than in other recent wars ."
2514,huh ? killing children is awful no matter how a many you kill . just because someone else has killed more doesn't suddenly make it justified . that is the definition of whataboutism . end of discussion .
2515,yes because this discussion all about palestine and israel . yes yes not a single mention of ukraine or russia at all .
2516,because its only bad when its done by commie bastards obviously / s
2517,always has been .
2518,"this one was entirely putin's doing . putin sent war to ukraine . the answer to that question is , tragically , war ."
2519,two things can be bad at once
2520,there's always one . it's never going to happen and you know it .
2521,who is gonna seize us assets ? nato ? china ? the us themselves ?
2522,i hope you feel morally superior with your comment . youre ignorant . youre disgusting . and you have no ide what youre talking about lol
2523,oh dont worry i hate america and russia i'm a good boy :)
2524,"because ukrainians are white and christian , afghanis are brown and muslim . sympathies are very much limited to people who look and think like us ."
2525,do you really see ua and afghanistan/iraq as comparable situations ? please don't tell me you're really that ashamed to be an american .
2526,even a doctor without borders hospital was bombed by the us . maybe after they put bush and obama in court for war crimes and everyone responsible it would be okay for americans to whine about what russia is doing 
2527,fuck obama . can't believe people think he was a good dude cos he was black and cool . i heard he locked up more black people than bush and trump as well .
2528,another deflection . let's worry about who has the smaller penis after the kids are done dying .
2529,another deflection .
2530,"um , im not sure how that one holds up"
2531,thanks buddy !
2532,youre incredibly dumb if you think is just the us and eu
2533,how did you come up with that number ?
2534,"it may be that evacuations , the notice of air raids and the prevalence of underground bunkers and basements is a big contributory factor"
2535,"> innocent civilians civilians are innocent , period . and define "" so low "" ? for 2 ukrainian soldiers you have on average 1 civilian killed as well ."
2536,only that isnt really the point he is making is it now ? he isnt saying its okay because another country has killed more he is just pointing out the hypocrisy the problem isnt him pointing out what isrsel is doing the problem is how most of us in the west dont bat an eye when its done by one of our allies but we are totally super morally outraged when its done by our class enemy . it needs to stop everywhere and not just in places where we dont agree with their political ideology because if we close our eyes to the issue in other places ( israel ) we be one part of the problem
2537,i don't see how ukrainian sympathizers can't even empathize a little with palestinians . even zelensky compares ukraine to israel when infact israel is an occupier . they literally conquered and settled palestine . i don't see much of difference .
2538,"big decisions like that arent just a simple idea . theres been many other things that led up to that . that time is where war is prevented . all everyone wants to talk about is how putin began attacks , but thats precisely how wars are justified even when theyre unjustified . talk about nato and deals broken and a history of mistrust which russia might have . not just putin . the alternative is also just waiting for one side to kill more people and then acting like nothing else could have been done ."
2539,doesn't make it untrue though
2540,notice how they have nothing to defend themselves with against the whataboutism claim ? they ain't got shit bud .
2541,"i see many similarities between ukraine and iraq . both conflicts were justified with nonsense rhetoric and have little justifications . both conflicts saw needless death and destruction . both conflicts kill indiscriminately with civilians , many women and children , butchered . yea , i'm damn ashamed of americans warmongering ways , i'm proud of different parts of america than our barbaric methods of profiteering ."
2542,"a deflection from what exactly , both posts that you said are deflecting , arent excusing russia , thats the now , its kinda like trying to deflect a bullet with your hand ."
2543,"it's false , that's one estimate of the overall civilian mortality in iraq ( of which us forces have been estimated to have caused around 10 %, and this comes from an anti-war website , which to be fair tried to do its best to discriminate the causes of death . of course you can argue that without the us invasion none of them would have happened ( which is a tough statement considering its ruler was saddam ) but it's not fair to blame them alone when events completely escaped their control and the civil war that ensued was against us interests and they tried to minimize it ."
2544,and probably the low fertility rate since the late 80's leading to fewer children per household .
2545,"pick any other recent war that's lasted 4 months and tell me how many children were killed . that's my definition of "" so low """
2546,"your appear to be justifying the invasion . you appear to be advocating the position that war can be an answer when previously you said you were tired with people thinking of war as an answer . we can talk about broken deals and mistrust all we want , is that justification for invading ukraine and annexing crimea ? i fear you have tied yourself into contradictory knots at the earliest step . putin is the head of state and the buck stops with him , it's a short hand way of implicating the kremlin/government/ex soviet network and not the russian populace directly . so let's continue . you say big decisions like this aren't a simple idea . i hate to break it to you , they really are . sure there's planning etc but the act of invasion is such a committal act that it must be distilled down to one of two things . either the basis for invasion is resources or ideology . it is that simple . the route to making that decision may be complex but complexity isn't justification or rationality . can you resolve your contradictions ?"
2547,"i didn't say it was false , i just said it's never going to happen ."
2548,"it's clear that you really don't understand either conflict . i'd suggest you educate youself , you should be embarrassed ."
2549,"minimizing putin's war crimes by talking about the past . should we minimize all atrocities by just referring to caine and abel , the ultimate betrayal ? a deflection isn't an excuse , it's attempting to change the conversation topic to something barely related rather than talk about something uncomfortable , like babies being killed by a conservative authoritarian dictator ."
2550,"> of course you can argue that without the us invasion none of them would have happened ( which is a tough statement considering its ruler was saddam ) you can easily say that tho . bremer's administration was by far destructive and lead to the destabilization of the country , that is the responsibility of the us government ."
2551,"armenian/azerbaijan war of 2020 . 29 azeri soldiers killed per azeri civilian . 45 armenian soldiers killed per armenian civilian . we're at 2 ukrainian soldier killed per ukrainian civilian . there you go , have fun grasping at straws ."
2552,where have i justified it ? i first compared putin to warmongers with both of them being guilty of taking innocent lives .
2553,you've managed to say nothing of substance . how on earth do you think anyone would feel embarrassed by that lol
2554,"hmm , going through your comments you havent referred to iraq babies being killed from a bullshit war , guess that just means youve forgotten it and care only about now . no matter the tense , or location , its inexcusable , but going back to the original issue is that what appears to be an american , posting a news article about a country killing innocents , in their war . i dont find it deflection , but exactly the same ."
2555,"yeah but that's a less extreme version of blaming serbia or gavrilo princip or russia or any other power for ww1 . sure he/they were reckless and maybe even wanted a limited war , but that led to a chain of events that escaped the control of any single state , so it's pretty disengenuous to blame 20 million deaths on one side . in this case , nobody forced the ex-saddam guys to ally with sunni extremists and start conducting a genocidal war against the general shi'a population . obviously the us shares a large part of the blame , but to say "" lol the us killed 1 million iraqis !"" is very misleading"
2556,"nice numbers game , ratios of soldiers to civilians isn't what anyone was talking about"
2557,you know you've been caught out .
2558,"it is , but let's not whitewash history and pretend that the us was a good thing to happen to iraq . i can guarantee you that if it wasn't the us but russia conducting this invasion , with the very same rules of engagement and casualties , we would have had a stark different point of view in regard to this war . but because the us is your country/a key western ally , because no one cares about iraq , the blame isn't as big as russia for what's happening to ukraine . in both instances though , we're witnessing an illegal invasion and pointless suffering for the interests of a few . the us just has tremendous economic and political influence to prevent any sort of credible pushback ."
2559,barely a hundred of civilian dead for armenia/azerbaijan . more than 5 thousands for ukraine .
2560,"no . i know people who defend ukraine cannot understand any other point or argument . but if someone is truly anti war then they must be anti war now , regardless of who is merely defending themselves ."
2561,"> it is , but let's not whitewash history and pretend that the us was a good thing to happen to iraq . that's debateable , given who the iraqi ruler was and who his successor would likely be - the psychopath uday hussein . but since we cannot deal with hypotheticals , we can never know . and it's true things did not go well at all . even today they are not great . > we would have had a stark different point of view in regard to this war . iraq was always far more controversial than afghanistan . and it was easily comparable to the unpopularity of vietnam . the only difference was there was no draft . > but because the us is your country/a key western ally , because no one cares about iraq , the blame isn't as big as russia for what's happening to ukraine . not really , russia's actions in ukraine are worse : it invaded a democracy , not a ruthless dictatorship , and it has annexed/plans to annex areas , which are major differences to the us in iraq ."
2562,"you can just admit you don't have stats on children casualties , you don't have to keep lying to yourself about the conversation you're having"
2563,"i have not stated whether i am pro or anti war at any point . you are clearly inferring what you will from what you read i have merely opined that the response to invasion ( justified or not ) it's going to be violence , i.e . war . that or capitulation which invariably leads to further conflict . call putin a warmonger . if you can call putin a warmonger then at least we can continue a conversation on the basis of you having some semblance of consistency . you have already called usa warmonger . ( my opinion on that shall remain undisclosed for now , you can assume if you wish )"
2564,it was a gesture of goodwill !
2565,"war of words always happens in war , but im more inclined to believe the ukrainian side rather than a russian funded news broadcaster during propaganda happy hour ."
2566,did it make them feel like a hero ?
2567,i assumed that is why they got out of there so fast
2568,"at this point this headline could say russians used mustard gas fill puppies with laser eyes on population of handicapped children and it wouldn't matter ? we know this monster is using almost whatever he can on these people . but nothing is being done really about it , other then all the leaders of the world are "" very angry at putin "" if we're not going to join the fight we have to give them what's needed to actually survive ."
2569,not even surprised anymore
2570,"isnt snake island the "" russian warship go fuck yourself "" island ?"
2571,"this just reminded me of the tons of napalm we used in vietnam . in addition to napalm , we also used willy peter , but mostly to clear out tunnel complexes ."
2572,"i know phosphorus is nasty shit , but isn't it not banned ? i believe the us uses it too ?"
2573,"ffs there was nobody on the island . yes white phosphorus is horrible , but if you're really just using it on equipment ( they left behind a lot when they retreated ) its not that bad , and definitely not a war crime by any definition . edit : this is in response to the comments , not the article"
2574,"they dropped four and missed ( as in missed and entire island ) with three . they do not have a limitless supply of such weapons . so even if they hit with all four of the weapons , they were still wasted trying to destroy their own abandoned equipment . it was yet another display of foolishness tinged with incompetence . wagner pilots maybe ?"
2575,to be fair those arent illegal
2576,usa used white phosphorus throughout the middle eastern wars .
2577,nobody has been on the island in a bit since it can be struck from land
2578,if theres video evidence of it then its just another crime russia with be charged with at the end of the war
2579,someone eli5 why are phosphorus bombs so bad ?
2580,was snake island the same island ukrain said those brave soldiers were killed but they really werent ?
2581,too bad most people have stopped caring about this conflict already . luckily the us and norwegian governments are still doing their part
2582,russia must be tired of losing equipment to the ukrainians . phosphorus is commonly used to destroy equipment .
2583,i mean its * snake island *. i would support nukes to destroy an entire island inhabited by only snakes
2584,"if only there were like people who could go find video and eye witness accounts related to this , to verify before simply parroting the governments claims ."
2585,"oh me oh my , we better hurry up and punish no one for this transgression . maybe we can get some low level pilot or munitions loader , but certainly not anyone who made the decision to do it ."
2586,uh pretty sure that's illegal . we're supposed to believe that russia is committing war crimes now ?
2587,isnt snake island small enough to be a bullseye for anybody lobbing munitions at it ?
2588,have we hit 4 digit war crimes yet ?
2589,when is ukraine going to take this to russia ? russia is trying to carve out the east of ukraine for itself . why not cut out some of russia for themselves ? that might bring a quick end to this crap .
2590,soi guess they want those mogo snakes off that island !
2591,just parting gift of fertilizer
2592,"they are just clearing the snakes off the island in a further gesture of good will . / s now it is the island formerly known as snake . the bomber has been renamed st . patrick , too ."
2593,dumb amrrican here says russia will drop nukes too no one believes him smh
2594,ukraine says a lot of things
2595,"ah yes , because the ukrainians have been so honest and reliable in their reporting ."
2596,ukraine is not so innocent . don't believe the us media which reports all ukrainian propaganda without any effort to fact check .
2597,"let me save you some time . phosphorus is not allowed for use on civilians during warfare , but is approved for military targets. and russia allegedly dropped white phosphorus on snake island , which is a military outpost ."
2598,a little parting gift ? putins army turns out to be a bunch of brutish thugs .
2599,they wanted to make sure the ukrainians could see where the island was .
2600,its was just a hot batch of fertilizer .
2601,"yes , you need phosphorus for atp"
2602,just more peacekeeping ! nothing to see .
2603,phosphorus is one of the essential building blocks of life !
2604,"this war kinda sus , no ?"
2605,russia also seems to have forgotten that modern technology means images and video of what is readily available very soon after something happens . hard to push their talking points when we have videos have them attacking civilians and non-military targets . not to mention the the clueless pows .
2606,what is the purpose of using phosphorus after they abandoned the island ? is it to destroy their own facilities ? to destroy vegetation ?
2607,"phone calls are regularly intercepted from ru soldiers on the front . they dont use any secure communications , and in fact rely on existing cell towers , because lol russia . anyway , its wildly common from ru soldiers to brag about their use of white phosphorous . now , i think like 95%+of these allegations from the ru soldiers themselves are bullshit , because theyll claim mass white phosphorus attacks more akin to wwi style trench chemical attacks that we just know arent happening because the ukrainians arent telling us they are . my point though is that if russians , when calling home , are inventing their use as some embarrassing ant desperate power fantasy and show of force to their girlfriends back home , i at the very least think the russians are not hesitant to use them . in short , if ukraine is claiming phosphorous use , i am at the least listening very very carefully ."
2608,ultimately that's the problem with an authoritarian regime . it's all well and good when you're in your country and everyone has to believe your bullshit . it takes a turn when you have to convince the rest of the world to buy your bullshit . your bullshit artists have no ammo in the rest of the world because no one trusts them .
2609,thats a weird way of saying you dont watch fox news .
2610,"both sides are equally full of shit , dont listen to either . ( pfp is just to piss of ukraine bros )"
2611,i.dont believe either one
2612,"i i didnt mean to hurt anybody. no one ever does , walker. "
2613,gotta play that 
2614,can i have a laser eyed puppy
2615,you know i have one simple request and that is to have puppies with frickin laser beams attached to their heads now evidently my cycloptic colleague informs me that that can't be done .
2616,"i don't know what you would have done . we are arming them , and financially knee capping the planet . short of actually going to war which would be way worse for everyone idk if we have many moves left ."
2617,would you prefer that a nato country enter the war directly ? because that wont end well for this planet .
2618,nato ( this includes us ) is upping the number of troops around ukraine . some shits coming !
2619,"giving ukraine what we can is all we can do . i sympathize with ukraine , and am very happy that they are winning , but it is not worth it starting world war 3 and a potential nuclear conflict over a single nation that seems to be winning anyway ."
2620,yes . it was also just retaken by ukrainian troops . not sure if the phosphorus use was before or after this retaking though .
2621,"yes , exactly the same . a tiny island with relatively high strategic value for its size"
2622,same island those brave ukrainian soldiers died on .
2623,"please , call him willy pete . willy peter is his father ."
2624,"they also used agent orange and i can be pretty sure that has probably killed more people on both sides from that war than either of those 2 ever did during the war . a lot of bad stuff is used during war , splintex rounds , claymores etc . also another point to add to your tunnel statement they also used a tonne of cs crystals and gas to clear and deny them , that would have been hell being in there ."
2625,addition to that we used agent orange .
2626,"** everyone ** uses it as a smoke agent . it forms po5 , which means that more than 80 % of your smoke came from the air , and not stuff you had to carry . it's also good shit because that shit is ** hot ** and it'll block day/night thermal vision systems in ways that other smoke doesn't . if you've ever seen a tank realize they've been targeted with a missile and "" pop smoke "" you've seen a wp munition used danger-close . incendiary munitions targeting civilians in general , though ? ** that's always ** a war crime . another frequent but legal use of wp munitions in theory is marking targets for an airstrike when you've got good air support , but you can't get close enough for laser-guided munitions . just pepper the enemy with wp , and tell the buffs to hit the smoke . isn't any better if you're on the receiving end of it , except thanks to the b52s carpet-bombing your location , you'll be dead before you have time to suffer much ."
2627,it's not banned because technically it's not a classified as a weapon . the us uses it in artillery shells to deploy smoke . just don't walk through the cloud ...
2628,yup ! the us uses it too . as well as israel .
2629,banned for used against personnel . you are allowed to use wp parachute flares to light up the battlefield
2630,its not banned as an anti-materiel weapon by anyone . i also think neither russia nor the us ( nor ukraine for that matter ) have ratified many relevant international weapons treaties .
2631,"it's not out right banned due to white phosphorus being used in smoke grenades but most countries agree not to use it against civilians , kind of like with flamethrowers , not banned just can't use them on civilian populated areas ."
2632,"its not phosphorus , they most likely dropped rbk-500 or rbk-250 cluster bombs , which contain 48 or 117 zab-2.5 thermite incendiaries . these burn for a few minutes , setting fire to fields and buildings . russia was caught using the rbk-500 in syria , they quickly edited out the incriminating footage but not before it was saved : russia is bombing its own military equipment that it wasn't able to remove from the island . the island in range of 155mm caesar howitzers that france gave ukraine . it was no longer possible for the russians to stay on the island . also , it is legal to attack military targets using incendiary weapons but its illegal to use them on civilian areas , the island is military . also , russia is not a signatory to the convention on cluster munitions ."
2633,any nation that uses white phosphorus should be charged with war crimes in the icc .
2634,with russia what difference does it make the use all kinds of bombs on civilians in apartments and shopping centers . even if ukraine wins there may be very little of many cities and towns left . the country's infrastructure and buildings will have to be rebuilt .
2635,it burns it don't stop burning and water don't put it out ..
2636,theyre not even the us uses them and in this case the island is empty
2637,they were presumed dead but were captured . they'd literally gain nothing by intentionally lying about that . this was at the start of the war .
2638,its not that i dont care . its just that what with my uterus now being the property of the supreme court i been slightly preoccupied . definitely still care tho .
2639,"the tweet in the article speculated that was what the russians were doing , since there were no mentions of ukrainian troops occupying the island ."
2640,""" what the fuck man ?"" - pre st . patrick ireland"
2641,always have been . 
2642,it isn't . use of wp and other incendiaries against military targets has never been restricted by various weapons conventions .
2643,"you know how they say , don't start a ground war with china ? russia has a population of 100 million more people than the ukraine . you start going in there , even the neutral and anti-invasion groups will get involved against you ."
2644,lmao real life isn't a videogame dude
2645,"if they did , their western support would probably dry up real fast . it is one thing to supply a defending nation , but supplying a nation on the offensive could be considered an act of war ."
2646,"yeah , because surely ukraine has the power to do that and that surely won't cause ww3 clueless"
2647,"honestly , they already have -- helicopter-bound airstrikes on strategic petroleum stockpiles near the border , as well as probable sabotage attacks have put russian armor in a world of hurt . not every tank is killed by a missile -- some just run out of gas and get stolen by a farmer . these raids are risky , though . not because ukranian forces haven't been surgical and have pissed off russia further , but you're risking a finite supply of aircraft and trained pilots behind enemy lines to blow that stuff up . rest assured , they're blowing up targets on russian soil but only the ones with actual ** strategic ** value ."
2648,they'd be better of sending a few small crews into russia to attack the facilities exporting gas and oil to china and india .
2649,they'd only do that in order to destroy infrastructure . i doubt ukraine would ever push russia's borders even if/when they have the capability .
2650,cause that would cause the war to be bigger . russia has a massive army but cant use it cause this is small operation to the russian people . if ukraine were to actually invade then russia would declare war and mobilize its full army . itd also be easier to convince people to join the military in russia if ukraine actually attacked . russia is also part of the csto . which has like millions troops available . and those troops would be activated if russia was invaded . theyve also been warned by the usa not to bomb russia . cant imagine theyd be ok with them marching over the border
2651,"you guys would just watch this happen over and over again and say , "" damn , that sucks for them ,"" without any ideas about how to end it . ukraine is not a nato member . they can do what they want . you think russia is going to nuke france or the us because ukraine attacked them on their own soil ? when germany was bombing london the british didn't just sit back and wonder when the germans would run out of bombs . they conducted air raids over germany . it seems logical to me to take it to the enemy so that their people actually feel some of the pain they are inflicting on you ."
2652,al jazeera is not a lesser known news site. 
2653,"aljazeera is "" lesser known ""?"
2654,"you have no idea what youre talking about . lesser known news site , lmfao"
2655,al jazeera is one of the top 10 biggest news organizations in the world . also one of the more respected .
2656,i'm here with all the others to tell you that you're a daft cunt .
2657,thats rich .
2658,special improvised lighthouse operation
2659,"basically yeah , i wouldn't be surprised if it turns into a field of wildflowers that bloom like crazy ."
2660,it was a child getting dragged out pissing on the floor
2661,they don't care . putin has always been into gaslighting on a global scale .
2662,"no , no , no , it was ukraine who bombed their own island "
2663,"it's not for us , it's for their citizenry . they're aware we'll never buy it ."
2664,"theres video of the us doing unspeakable things as well . remember collateral murder ? you know , that thing that got julian assange in trouble to this day ? what happened ? did the american people unrelentingly protest until something would change or people were punished for their war crimes ? no ? didnt think so ."
2665,"> hard to push their talking points when we have videos have them attacking civilians and non-military targets . did you see the news reporting when the us bombed an afghan family during the retreat from afghanistan earlier this year ? the initial narrative was that this was a terrorist group , the shape of the explosion suggested there was a car bomb , and so on . later on , when it turned out it was an afghan family with a bunch of kids , the news died down after a couple of days . the russians need to learn from the us on modern propaganda techniques . america used white phosphorus in iraq and afghanistan , but you don't see a lot of criticisms from countries like canada or australia or france , do you ?"
2666,what about the video we don't see though . they show us what they want us to see and believe
2667,putin doesnt care about the videos when he has a button he can push today and end the whole world .
2668,"it appears now that as the russians tried to leave the island , the ukrainians continued to hammer them with artillery and drone strikes , so they more or less ran away . that left several valuable pieces of equipment on the island which the russians then proceeded to attempt to bomb ( there's actually video , they drop 4 bombs from a jet and in the island once and the ocean three times )"
2669,probably more effective at destroying all the abandoned stuff they left .
2670,"russia does not have any phosphorus incendiary weapons , they are thermite or thermite-magnesium incendiary weapons . it's easy to tell the difference as the russian weapons generate a lot less smoke compared to phosphorus munitions . they have two main incendiary weapons , aircraft dropped and surface to rockets . the aircraft dropped incendiaries include the rbk-250 and [ rbk-500 ]( cluster bombs which contain 48 or 117 [ zab-2.5 thermite incendiary ]( submunitions . russia was caught using the rbk-500 in syria , they quickly edited out the incriminating footage but not before it was saved for posterity : russia also has the [ 9m22s ]( a rocket fired by the bm-21 grad . ths warhead of the rocket ( 9n510 ) contains over 100 magnesium-thermite incendiaries . the 9m22s was used on azovstal ( see from 21 seconds in the following video ): note there's far more individual burning fragments compared to the zab-2.5 , also there far less smoke compared to phosphorus ."
2671,"fox tries to move the government , the government does move fox"
2672,""" it takes a strong man to deny what's in front of him ."""
2673,"i was disappointed that it's literally impossible not to use that weapon though . aside from just turning the game off , i guess . it's pretty apparent even through your obstructed vision that something just doesn't look right ."
2674,"it's so good . mechanically , it's not the best , but spec ops's story alone makes up for it ."
2675,literally the best military shooter in terms of story thats out atm . its a freaking trip .
2676,gotta play what ?
2677,"in order to get you one , we'll have murder around a million puppies in a barrage of nuclear weapons until one mutant puppy finally rises from the waste to exact vengeance in mankind . but , yes , assuming you can melt his undead radioactive heart , you can take him home ."
2678,russia bombed it after signing an agreement to leave . i am guessing the russians were hoping ukraine troop would have moved onto the island and maybe this would have kill them . this may also be an example of how putin will act if he loses the war and even signs a truce . what putin might do is think well i lost now i am going to nuke ukraine because i am going to be removed by the russians so what do i have to lose . if the report he is sick and may only live two more years or less he might push the nuke button in the last few weeks he will live .
2679,"russia bombed an empty island with phosphorus to stop ukraine from having whatever russia left behind when they gave up and ran . ukraine also bombed an empty island a little after russia left in case the russians change their mind and re-occupy it . there was video of an abandoned missile system , and the final moments of the hidden camera system that had been watching the russians the whole time . snake island was a massive resource sink for russia to try to hold , with unreasonable amounts of / r/combatfootage loss porn . ukraine could land on it , but it would be a money pit for them too so they'll only claim it in spirit ."
2680,the only thing we called a peter in the field artillery was our dicks .
2681,i thought that was william s peter ?
2682,its only banned for use vs military targets that can not be separated from civilians . its use is often officially stated as marking targets as it creates a large white smoke cloud extremely quickly .
2683,"no , wp is not banned by the geneva conventions . incendiary weapons were ** restricted ** by a 1980 protocol to which there [ was not unanimous agreement ]( furthermore , even under the constraints of the protocol , incendiary weapons are only banned in the context of using them against civilian targets or using them against military targets in civilian areas . using them against military targets , even in an anti-personnel role , does not violate the 1980 protocol . so , russia using phosphorous to ( presumably ) destroy equipment left behind on snake island is completely within the rules of war ."
2684,"the stuff is a horrorshow , banning it is just plain good judgement ."
2685,i knew someone who got doused in agent orange at a old church . it messed them up .
2686,my uncle is dying in hospice from agent orange related liver disease right now . the past wasn't that long ago .
2687,"wouldnt it be more like 73 %, given the atomic weights of p and o ?"
2688,"its not phosphorus , they most likely dropped rbk-500 or rbk-250 cluster bombs , which contain 48 or 117 zab-2.5 thermite incendiaries . these burn for a few minutes , setting fire to fields and buildings . russia says is bombing its own military equipment with su-30 fighter bombers , equipment it wasn't able to remove from the island . the island in range of ukrainian 155mm caesar howitzers that france gave ukraine . it was no longer possible for the russians to stay on the island ."
2689,"> banned for used against personnel . no exactly , it's ok to use it for its incendiary effects but not its chemical effects . it's weird but the rules are weird like that . and you can't use incendiary weapons in civilian areas > you are allowed to use wp parachute flares to light up the battlefield you don't use it for flares , it's used for creating smoke screens ."
2690,it is not banned for use against personnel . the ccw is quite clear on that .
2691,iirc paraillumes are burning magnesium
2692,"> incendiary weapons are illegal under geneva convention no , they aren't . the use of incendiaries against ** civilian targets ** ( or military targets in civilian areas ) was restricted by the 1980 protocol on conventional weapons , but that's it ."
2693,"no incendiary weapons are legal , if they are used to attack military targets , but its illegal to use them on civilian areas . snake island is military . also , russia is not a signatory to the convention on cluster munitions . the us has not admitted using phosphorus incendiary weapons . on the contrary the us claims their phosphorus *** smoke shells *** ( e.g . m825 155mm shells ) are not used to set fire to stuff but are only used for smoke generation , to hide friendly troops ; that is how they get away firing phosphorus smoke shells on civilian areas . that said , the smoke ( phosphorus pentoxide ) is highly toxic . the us military used phosphorus shells to smoke out iraqi rebels in fallujah iraq in nov 2004 , and later isis in 2014-16 . theyd saturate an area with phosphorus smoke and then bomb fighters out in the open after they exited their bunkers and foxholes for fresh air ( israel likely uses the same tactics ). they called it shake and bake . we fired shake and bake missions at the insurgents , using wp to flush them out and he to take them out. using the asphyxiant effects of phosphorus may contravene the chemical weapons convention , which bans using any chemical weapons to kill or injure the enemy ( the cw convention is very strict , even tear gas is banned in war ( but not civilian riots ))."
2694,"i'm not talking about the article , i'm talking about the comments"
2695,"listen , russia is shit , but this isn't remotely a war crime . the use of wp and other incendiaries against military targets is fair game ( especially when it's their own stuff !)."
2696,how do you put it out ? smother it ?
2697,"what do you mean gain nothing ? you dont remember all the support for ukrain , and anger towards the russians in those threads ??? how is that different from war propaganda ? deliberately providing the media with false information to gain support via sympathy . you can believe it was intentional or not , but you cant truly believe they gained nothing ."
2698,"remember , russia meddled in our democracy for exactly this reason ."
2699,and who operated online troll farms that helped brainwash and radicalize gullible conservatives on social media into voting trump into office and installing religious fundamentalist judges in the courts ?
2700,i forgot that reddit doesn't understand sarcasm . should have put an / s for all you autists .
2701, what an idea ! ukraine should just take over russia and end the war . someone get kennightphd on the phone with zelensky .
2702,do you think they'd be seen as bullies ? aggressors ? really ?
2703,they're at war . what have the last five months been ??
2704,"the idea is to shock the aggressor into returning to their own country and leaving yours . if you just defend yourself on your own territory this is potentially endless . shit , it's already been ongoing for eight years +. you think ukraine setting foot into russian territory would cause wwii ? clueless !"
2705,they are already mobilizing chechnyans and others from as far east as tuva . that's not a war ??
2706,it's definitely not lesser know but i don't know about respected . it's basically qatari propaganda at times . they do seem to be more neutral when it doesn't involve the arab world i guess .

2728,"remember , the core thought processes behind this - intrusion of christianity into the state , fascism , misogyny , etc . are far more intrinsic to america and contribute far more to the present situation , compared to any recent destabilisation efforts . they sped things up at best , but the rot is within america itself ."

2733,haha okay .
2734,"well , that and the fact that he's a white supremacist dictator . his country now looks a lot like the jim crow era of american history that republicans want to return to , and that's why they support him ."
2735,found the toxic fucking bridge troll .
2736,"yep . i remember reading about this . it wasn't some super hush hush thing . in america , we have free media , which means when the truth comes out our media companies are allowed to publish it and make it known , and the government can't stop it . russia does not have free media . if a journalist published something putin says is wrong , they're as good as dead ."
2737,"that is the beauty of american propaganda . you can always find news articles talking about it , but then it dies down , and the media does not bring it up anymore . more importantly , the credibility of america is not affected . > it's always lies and spin and there is no media in russia to say otherwise . you take incidents of the russian government lying , and you automatically distrust ** everything ** the russian government says . the us government also lied in the past , but how many people automatically distrust ** everything ** the american government says ? i am not saying that russian government is trustworthy . my point is the lack of skepticism and distrust of the us government . that is the beauty of american propaganda . it has brainwashed people into thinking that shitty american acts are the result of individuals ( e.g . trump ) and not the american people ."
2738,"as i said , the media ** does ** report on american atrocities , but there are no long term effects . people still give the us government the benefit of the doubt . people don't go around calling us military "" killers "", or call the us government war criminals . there are no sanctions against us officials involved in war crimes . in short , when america does shitty things , it is the fault of a few individuals . when russia does shitty things , it is the fault of the russia , the entire government ."
2739,"people act like they it's somehow a sage criticism that a linear story is played ... in a linear way . and the linearity , on-roads nature of "" rah rah war "" gaming was precisely what it wanted to satirize - only this one drags you into madness instead of a hero ceremony at the end . you don't deliver the inverse call of duty without linearity . not giving you a choice was the point .

2754,"everything you say shows ignorance of the current state of american society . the republican party has developed a mentality where "" big government "" is always assumed to be bad and any exercise of government power must be justified and weighed against all possible faults and arguments , real or imaginary , before that power is allowed to be given to the federal government . if republican voters do not have something to complain about , the republican party will gladly make something up and those voters won't just stare at it , they will eat it . "" critical race theory "" is a fantastic example of fabricated controversy . so is "" post-birth abortion "". these tactics are effective in allowing the republican party to implement the broad stroke policies that result in the matters you want to hear complaints about without causing too much fuss among their own voters . in addition , republicans have been sticking out the threat of civil war and rubbing it for so long that i'm worried they need to go see a doctor before they sustain permanent damage to the poor thing . the democratic party has the issue of trying to hold on to the last shreds of the mask of representation . the legal framework that protected the right of women in the united states to access abortion at the federal level was revoked and the power to determine whether or not a woman can access abortion is now decided by the state she is currently in . many states had legislation in place to take effect only if roe vs . wade was overturned , so abortion was effectively banned in much of the united states immediately . while this is shocking , it is the logical conclusion of a train of events where republicans have used the constitution to force their way into deciding on whether or not such rights exist on the national level . since you're not from around these parts , while abortion isn't exactly "" popular "" it is a pretty solid majority of americans that believe that women should have the right to access and receive an abortion in the united states if she chooses to do so until the point of viability . the fact that the legal mechanism that enshrined a human right was revoked against the opinion of this majority of citizens is extremely troubling and invokes distrust in the very framework of our government . you're not complaining about the people trusting the american government blindly . they don't . you're complaining about the american people not complaining about what you want them to be complaining about . i assure you we're complaining , but we've got our own shit to deal with ."
2755,"i just linked you to a major us media report about the pentagon detailing specific systemic failures after its own inquiry . it literally cant get any more explicit than that . it , literally , blamed the system itself and the us military publicly proposed changes to its system . edit : as to * why * the perception is different , this exchange is exactly why dude lol . russia denies that the bucha massacre happened and then blamed imaginary nazis for it . russian media has never truthfully reported the incident and the russian state will never take responsibility for it . in contrast , us media immediately reported that the air strike killed civilians and the us military admitted the error and publicly announced systemic changes to avoid it in the future . they did so after a full inquiry into their own behavior . ** thats ** why theyre treated differently ."
2756,"i dont get the criticism either . the game isnt mass effect , and the choices you did have were kinda far and in between . i think its just kind of a sign of just how impactful that that scene was , where people complain because they couldnt get out of it ."

2800,news update : putin shifts strategy in ukraine . now using fresh conscripts as ammunition .
2801,remedy that by taking what's left and get the hell out of ukraine .
2802,the bill is not signed yet and it will take them weeks to have any effect and months to have a real effect . i bet they don't even know what things they can repair in great numbers given the sanctions . in the meantime poland is already helping ukraine with repairs and they are receiving new equipment all the time . hopefully the inflection point occurs soon where russia can no longer advance forward using overwhelming hardware and we start to see acceleration in the destruction of russian heavy equipment .
2803,"how the fuck were they ever planning to go toe to toe with nato in ww3 if they can't even handle four months vs ukraine ? i know ukraine has had a lot of help , but holy shit vs a full fledged nato fighting for it's life they would've been trounced in less than a week ."

2811,"ah ok , i thought they just preferred their t62 tank above their t90 "

2822,russia rarely volunteers the truth for anything . i would take this with a grain of salt .
2823,its like when i start a war in civilization woefully underprepared and try to sunk cost fallacy my way through it
2824,im worried as their options run low if they would tap in to their large reserve of low yield tactical nukes .
2825,i mean ukraine hasn't even gotten a third of the us javelin supplies .
2826,"that's why it is time to send more weapons to ukraine . if russia is lobbing as much artillery as claimed , their artillery tubes have got to be really shot and they are losing accuracy because the rifling of the barrels is worn down to nothing ."
2827,"let's keep the pressure on . june might have seemed like a dark month , but there's an old saying about it being darkest before dawn . i think russia may end up cracking sooner than many predicted ."
2828,"im skeptical of this due to the fact that they claimed the russian army would collapse in 2 weeks , months ago , or the fact that russia had run out of missiles . call me a russian bot but ill believe it when i see it ."
2829,"so this is them passing similar laws like ww1 britain did , commonly refered to as the slavery act . it nearly caused a revalution . here is hopeing russians will feel the same way ."

2831,"this is a little mis-characterized . russia is hurting on high quality military equipment . however , even running low they still have a lot , and can continue to pressure through mass . their shortages are especially sharp for csw and weapons designed for iads rollback , but they have enough baseline artillery and dumb bombs to fight this war for years ."
2832,putin is the king of deception . that means they have a lot of ammo and will do a surprise attack . ukrainians should not take it easy . keep attacking putins terrorists .
2833,yet still russia blows the fk out of ukraine . i don't believe these articles anymore .
2834,"actual news : russia passes bill to fast track repair and manufacture of equipment propaganda news : omg russia lost all its weapons , 40k dead sours : trust me bro"
2835,and land lease is just starting .
2836,running out of a lot of things . interesting to see if a china helps with equipment .
2837,so ukraine just needs to rope-a-dope .
2838,this was inevitable right ? ukraine is backed by the west . russia is backed by no one and has decade of incompetence and corruption .
2839,my guess is this is happening to a lot of artillery pieces . you can only fire so many shells before maintenance becomes a necessity
2840,"they dont need weapons , its only a special military operation ."
2841,"> the bill proposed , among other measures , "" the implementation of material assets from state reserves "" and "" the temporary activation of mobilization capacities and facilities ,"" as well as overtime work in "" individual organizations ."" well , that just sounds like a soviet-era command economy with extra steps . i guess it makes sense , considering their preferred military tactics and strategies ."
2842,great . so at this rate when will russia end the fighting and retreat out of courtesy ? 1 month ? 1 year ? 2 years ?
2843,earlier than expected all the osint folks was talking about august and september for when russia has to back off to a disposition where they cant just use up all the stockpiled ammo
2844,bitch is about to get clapped
2845,they are what ? admitting something that makes them russians look bad !?
2846,another daily dose of russia running out of resources so we'll continue to believe that this war won't last
2847,theres always sticks and stones and lots of screaming ! ukraine should just march up to the kremlin and ask to see putin and kick his ass . its only some 200 miles away ! sarcasm
2848,you cant believe him . hes a snake .
2849,i think that somewhat explains why they can't go all in on ukraine as ammunition weren't enough
2850,the world's smallest balalaika can be heard playing ...
2851,"the casualty rate has slowed down a bit , but it's nice to know russia is well on their way to 40,000 dead invaders by the end of the month ."
2852,"i'm going take a guess and say , the country with the biggest landmass on earth , and allied to china , will be able to make more weapons ."
2853,"not to take anything away from ukrainians who have fought and sacrificed more than anyone could have reasonably expected ... that said , holy shit how russia's military capabilities have been overestimated . either another brutal intelligence failure or a military industrial complex corruption issue . whatever it is , lets figure it out later and lean in to give ukraine whatever weapons it needs to minimize the slaughter of ukrainian civilians and allow them to retake their territory"
2854,"article doesnt sound anything that russia would admit . they never speak of a war , because with a war there are rules to follow , with that special thing they have a loophole . if they ever trip on their words and call it a war , then we need to abuse it hard !"
2855,invading other countries will go well then 
2856,just because they ratify a piece of toilet paper doesn't mean they can will western parts and expertise into existence .
2857,guess those supplies routes to russia are being cut 
2858,"artillery rounds : the us had 25 million rounds in the 90s if russia has that much , their 60,000 would last a year .... total ....."
2859,"as for military equipment , ukraine claims to have disabled some 1,500 russian tanks , 3,600 armored vehicles , 750 artillery pieces , and 210 aircraft since february 24 , 2022 . these are considerable figures according to specialists , although all agree that they are overestimated . about 800 tanks have been lost , or about 7 % of the entire russian army , even though it would be closer to 10 % to 15 % if we only consider the tanks ready to be sent into battle , according to military specialists . the state of ammunition reserves also raises questions . although the former red army has huge arsenals inherited from the soviet era , they are often old equipment . its reserves of modern weapons are more modest and have been largely depleted . according to the pentagon , moscow has already used 60 % of its cruise missiles . we have noticed that russia is carrying out far fewer rocket attacks and it has used h-22 rockets ; they are old 1970s soviet rockets, noted vadym skibitsky , deputy head of ukrainian military intelligence , in the guardian on june 10 , 2022 . russian cruise missile stocks are probably running out, confirmed the british ministry of defence in a statement published on 20 june 2022 . the big question now concerns the rearmament capabilities of the russian army . the west faces a major challenge in estimating these capabilities . we must also imagine that china will probably come to russia's aid in this area ."
2860,"what a clickbait title and a poor article ... russia doesn't admit anything , they create laws to move further and further to a war economy . it involves many things since , despite the sanctions and lack of supplies , they have a country full of factories who can deliver , probably not everything the would like , but take priority on the rest . and they have plenty of money ( even if they can't buy all they want...at least to us and europe . but the world is not just us and europe ... of course the used a lot of weapons in donbass , and we see old vehicles coming , but running out ? you don't say anything like that in your article.and they would have only a broken t-34 in ukraine , they would still not admit anything . you don't develop on the real impact of the law ... which is quite important . moving to a war economy is not just fixing few trucks ."
2861,i think they are introducing slave labour .
2862,"no surprise nato wants 300,000 soldiers at the eastern flank , when russia is doing mobilization but not calling it a mobilization . "
2863,putin and his terrorists need to retreat from ukraine . the war is costing too much money with no roi .
2864,its got to the point now where i can't even stand the sight of putin's face any more . i actually feel anger or a need to burst out laughing . it was the same with trump . i just had this urge to punch the mother fucker and seeing putin's cake hole causes the same urge in me . am i a bad person ?
2865,"never underestimate the enemy .. and it's lies .. russia may run out of weapon-supplies they had stored for this single-war .. - but in general - the strategic reserves , for-ex mainland & border-defence that aren't included/used/relocated in case of a long-term or bigger war - are still huge .. it's dangerous to believe such "" news ""."
2866,i wonder if this is part of the * stalling * we all saw on the part of the west . they must have known about timing on this and ukraine has been saying they will have their major offensive in late summer . if this is true and starts to have implications in the field i can see ukraine taking back everything .
2867,now if they could bomb a few distilleries the war would be over
2868,stupid question no1 . can ukraine not get a couple guys to level the kremlin ?
2869,it's a lie
2870,"explains why theyre cosying up further to belarus , need their weapons and their cannon fodder"
2871,"a country with almost limitless resources for everything , so i highly doubt really"
2872,then why they managed to get sievierodonetsk ?
2873,"in ruzzia it's called "" where house "" cause they have no clue where to house vital equipment .. "
2874,so china start getting itchy feet and turn their attention from taiwan to moscow ..
2875,thats his watching porn face
2876,thats a back door draft and mobilization if i ever saw one .
2877,that is a mean word now you delusional dim witted being
2878,"might get desperate enough to drop a nuke , that fucker is crazy . hopefully,which i doubt will happen , they wont obey his order ."
2879,"if ukraine keeps blowing up ammo depots with their new weapons , this war could be over soon !!!!!"
2880,nonsense . more pretend info . russia is nowhere near any issues . this is just dream news for all hopeful ukrainians that have been conscripted by america to fight their russian cousins
2881,"actually , russia will win this war , and the sad thing is all the ukrainians conscripted just to get hit by artillery and missles from space . and before you get all excited and have a meltdown , im canadian , dont even know a russian in canada , never left here , so i can see objectively based on facts , not imagination and happy thoughts ."
2882,dont underestimate putin or russia . you can bet they are in full production . putin isnt stupid . hes cunning and ruthless . this isnt happenstance . hes thought it out and his strategists know just what they doing .
2883,its like the dj khalid of arms shipmentsand another one! 
2884,joe is like oprah with russian removal devices !
2885,it's also a clear signal that random fires and poorly piloted drones falling from the sky will finish them off .
2886,yeah russia is as vulnerable as it has ever been . go ukraine !!!
2887,i'm sure the ukrainians have just been watching and gps cataloging ammo depot's that were out of range of their artillery the last month .. then himars and excaliburs arrived . big bada boom
2888,"this is the wrong headline and i'm sorry to say , the wrong take . russia has just found a way to institute general mobilization without declaring war . they called up the draft , and made the "" special military operation "" no longer voluntary for those in the military ."
2889,"possibly sanction effects as well since electronics are apparently in short supply . the gearboxes of the refurbished t-64s soon will only run in three modes "" whites "", "" synthetics "" or "" rinse and spin dry ""."
2890,"the statement looks more like a deliberate russian lie so that other countries would believe it and stop supplying arms to ukraine . russia has produced quite a lot of ammunition , because it should be taken into account that they did not destroy any weapons , which was foreseen by the agreement with the west . they simply hid the weapons . fits their character . now there are only difficulties with delivery - road problems in russia ."
2891,"while pretending to have the western parts required to build or maintain tanks , planes etc ."
2892,the western intelligence agencies will pay them not to work and organize strikes .
2893,"yeah , on paper russia have more hardware than any other country . in actuality , that hardware has been rotting away in warehouses since the cold war without maintenance and years of corruption has likely seen most of it stripped of parts or sold altogether . hence why they are shipping out the tanks from the 60s which have seen little modernisation since the early 90s"
2894,"considering they are struggling with civilian car manufacturing , i'd say that any military equipment repair would be outsourced and incredibly slow . given the speed american forces can replenish it's stockpiles from what we have sent to ukraine , it will take russia a decade or so to just get it's territorial defense back up , let alone enough armament to try a ukraine 2.0 . those thoughts of course is if sanctions was to drop off today . of course by then , ukraine will be at a level where if it were to occur , the us marines and ukrainian army would create a meat grinder at the first check point going into ukraine . this is russia's last chance to do something like this , and putin knows it ."
2895,"> so essentially they have burned through the equipment of their army and need "" special measures "" to maintain present strength . sucks to be them "
2896,i get the feeling the reported losses of russian equipment and men reported by the ukrainian's is low . which is amazing sad ones is inclined to over report you're enemies losses .
2897,"the 11th bigger economy , biggest country in the world , full of gas , petrol , ore , and good friend of african countries who have ore , is about to turn its economy into full dedication to war production . they dont give a shit about the west . let's not be blind here . my hope would be that their lack of organization screws everything . so it will be faster to get rid of them . we will eventually get rid of them , but they may be able to build few annoying things ."
2898,well i guess they will do it with swords then
2899,that thing is dead so now they will canabilize a rotting corpse that wont yield much
2900,haven't they already been doing that ? isn't that why gazprom crashed ?
2901,its actually a broadly worded law that allows moving their economy to a war footing . question is can they do it in a meaningful way .
2902,the idea of conscripts being launched from catapults at buildings pleases me
2903,talk about cannon fodder !
2904,"by the end of july all the newly promised gmlrs platforms will be in ukraine , a 4-fold increase in capability . given how much damage 4 himars have done already to russias bloated logistics profile needed to support its massed artillery doctrine , i think their capabilities are soon to be diminished even harder . not to mention the 100 + more howitzers coming in ( including spgs and field guns )"
2905,help from china
2906,"i would say this was common knowledge even before ukraine . that is also why putin is obsessed with nato as he knows he cannot beat them . nato would have utterly smashed russia in a war , possibly russia could have taken the baltics for some time but overall it is a definite loss . victory parade in moscow , all that within a short period of time ."
2907,return of the ukraine
2908,"the american arty deliveries are trash . the ukrainian deputy defense minister said that 2/3rds are out of service already . those m777s are not fit for artillery duels . they replaced steel components with titanium to drastically reduce weight , producing shitty barrels that fail really fast under sustained fire , not to mention other defects , which have been known for years : so these things are adequate for blowing up third world insurgents in sandals(but only if you have a fuck-ton of replacement barrels ) but they fail at their job against an industrialised foe that has artillery of their own . french ceasars are shit too for this war . the gun is excellent but it's attached to an unarmoured civilian truck that's a sitting duck in any sort of industrialised war . african insurgents with kalashnikovs are impotent against them , but the russians are raining down 1,000-1,500 tons of shells on eastern ukraine every day so their expected life expectancy is abysmal . it's a death trap , even a single stray bm-21 rocket can destroy it . there's a reason why other industrial nations mount spgs on heavily armored vehicles , not fucking civilian renault trucks ."
2909,yeah . the smoke is to cover the crimean troops rapidly advancing on ukrainian positions near rostov .
2910,"> kerch bridge i know you don't like it , but i still think you should wait with that one . they need it to run over when they leave . right ?"
2911,"can someone explain me why this word ( maskirovka ), is being used by english speaking crowd ? as language bearer , it sounds a bit cringe to me everytime i see it . since the only common usage of it is in context of "" disguise , camouflage "". like , when person wears black glasses or when you cover a tank with green net to hide it in the forest . never saw it being used in this kind of "" doctrine "" or "" strategy "" or "" operation "" context , and as far as i understand english speaking people use it in this context . must be something from cold war ? since i often see it , "" ahhh this must be russian maskirovka "" when , for example people speculate about russia moving tanks to fool other side , planning false attracks , or saying one thing and then do another . but that's not maskirovka ! we don't use this word like that . to clarify , i don't want to correct people saying it , rather interested in history behind this phenomenon . if such history even exists , of course ."
2912,ditto
2913,"> orkistan gold , jerry ! gold !"
2914,"lets not be too cocky . that was russias failure , it wont be ours . id say 4 weeks until their military is ground down to a tiny nub ."
2915,many of the missiles being fired are like 50 years old . doesn't seem like they are producing many new missiles .
2916,"all these missiles attacks add up . they may be old but they still destroy things or people . there are a lot of rumors flying around , some of them started by russian agents in the west . they want to make the western people belive the war will be over soon hoping that they will support ukraine with less military supplies . why do you think zelensky is always asking and criticizing the west to send more ? he knows the war is far from over and ukraine needs all the help they can get ."
2917,"hey belarus , you know how we destroyed our economy , armed forces , and diplomacy ??"
2918,no . i've been to moscow . the worst thing ukraine can do to russia is let them keep it
2919,that's what happened of course but then along came the hero putin to undertake the quest to seek out the pieces and unite them once again . / s
2920,then we would have a shitload of nukes in the hands of a bunch of countries run by warlords
2921,"\+ 1 yeah sometimes i really have the feeling that our infos are not better than the propaganda russia have . ans that people , especially on this sub , thinks that this is almost over . that's not the reality . the reality is bad , very bad . and please call me russian bot too , my best friend would be happy to come with me to kick your ass . but sorry you'll have to wait , he is busy defending his country on the battlefield ."
2922,russians love beeing killed . they have this cultural thing where they do not value human life - so they are happy to get them selves killed . there are videos of drunk people in russia beeing sad that they cannot experience the war . at this point i hope that russia starts enlisting young women ( 16 - 28 ) - to speed up the killing of young russians as much as possible .
2923,"i know just like russia marched in on kyiv wait no . at least the mighty moskva still sails oh wait , bottom of the sea it was worth it to control snake island though ! wait , what ?"
2924,i would have no problem if kiev-russia is restored in the form of ukraine annexing moscow and other parts of russia . atleast moscow would get some culture in this way !
2925,the best way to get rid of an enemy is to make a friend .
2926,"russia is doomed to lose this war , this is the beginning of the the end for authoritarian leadership in that region . putins been overeating himself too long . the ordinary russians will pay heavily before they act on their frustrations . every dog has its own day ."
2927,you don't make any sense at all ..
2928,are you retarded ? it;s a serious question
2929,since you see things objectively from such a long distance...why will russia win ?
2930,i lolled 
2931,they are going to start begging china to send ammo to them .
2932,ivan's terrible smoking habit . we should send him a few more packs of his favorite brand .
2933,"oh yes . i'm certain zelensky's generals have a very long "" to do "" list and have been waiting for the right tools to do it with ."
2934,have there been reports of the long range missiles blowing up the russian arms depots ?
2935,"> russia has just found a way to institute general mobilization without declaring war . pretty huge news : "" the temporary activation of ** mobilization capacities **"" this is absolutely the biggest takeaway from the bill put in front of the duma today . it means they're out of soldiers , not just equipment . it's sly wording , but it puts russia on full war footing - legally and economically . i guess we'll see how far down this rabbit hole goes ..."
2936,"sorry for the wholesome award , i didnt know what to do with it but wanted to reward you . i am glad that there are people who understands how important is this news . i can't believe newsweek didnt understand it . and reading the comments , i also have the feeling that this could be taken as propaganda and people are taking it straight away.the only good news i see is that russia left the snake island ( it was not really a ukrainian battle victory ); they went back on few areas that they didnt consider important.but they are progressing , and they are following their strategy . they won donbass battle . ukr is still not able to take back kherson . and progress on the coast.ukraine army is missing everything , sometimes even rifles . we can guess they have way more casualties than what they communicate . their economy is almost ruined.they will get cannons , weapons , trainings from the west , ok . it's super slow . it will take months . and it won't be enough . in the meantime we just read that russia just announced they shift their economy into war economy , and introduce mobilization . this is a huge step . they have shitloads of money , despite the sanctions . they have '' friends''countries all over the world . and those who are not their friends don't care about this war . and people here applause ? wth ? we don't see the same things probably . russia is currently winning the war . where will they stop ? no idea.i guess it will be after taking odessa ( that would be a tragedy ). i remain optimistic , ukraine will win . but currently , they are dying . and this article is not a . good news , because the war will last longer . which is a tragedy . my best friend who is serving in the south front ( as i heard , it's difficult to have news ) and my colleague's relatives also fighting are dealing with life every second . i have a russian colleague . i discussed the situation with him . he probably will never return in russia ( he was already in trouble in russia for years as he was not exactly a putin's supporter and had issues ). he told me , and he was very devastated when saying it : in western countries you are laughing about russian propaganda , but you do more and more the same . and you are completely wrong about what's happening in russia . the situation has not deteriorated that much . life is going on , almost as usual . but the hate is growing . propaganda is doing an efficient job . putin could realize his objective to have his population very supportive . and it will come one ay or another , when ukraine will use a us/nato weapon against russian civilians . putin could even do a fake terrorist attack ; he already did that for his war in chechnya . this could change a lot of things . and remember that the entire world doesn't like nato , and even hate usa . the biggest mistake in a war is when we underestimate the enemy . putin did that.i have the feeling that many people are doing the same now . let's be optimistic , positive , for the people outthere , for my friend oleksii fighting there , but let's not be stupid . war is not over , ukrainian army is dying , and even lots of himars and hi tech artillery wouldnt be enough .... air support , more diverse vehicles , missiles ... so please newsweek , do your job and inform people ; and not in the way a russian newspaper does . we don't need bullshit . we want victory ."
2937,then the new recruits can specially go fuck themselves .
2938,"possibly , but you got to remember that the great buildup that got russia here took many decades . gun powder does lose it's effectiveness over time , and in more extreme cases , it won't give the momentum to get the bullet out of the gun . aside from long term storage , they sell a lot of weapons and armor , don't take care of what they got , and general skimming off the top corruption can lead to shortages . with all that , since the buildup of the cold war , russia has been burning through weapons and ammo in multiple theaters as russians are prone to do . with such a tiny gdp , it's military budget probably couldn't handle these factors . this is self evident by russia reaching out to china and belarus for equipment and ammo ."
2939,maybe even inserting invisible parts to declare that the machine is finished and ready for battle ..
2940,warehouses ? most have been rotting away in high humidity open air environments .
2941,"> has been rotting away in warehouses in many cases , not even in warehouses . thus , wheeled equipment suffering from flat tires on the glorious march to kyiv because vehicles were stored outside and the rubber deteriorated from the elements and uv . russia is sometimes our best ally via their corruption and stupidity ."
2942,"they were also one of the world's largest exporter of arms and armor for a time , so that took care of a lot of the modern stuff ."
2943,"general 1 : "" warehouse ? you were lucky to have a warehouse ! we used to store our tanks in a field , all 7000 of them . and half the ground was missing . they were all huddled in one corner , for fear of falling , into the earth ."" general 2 : "" you were lucky to have a field . we used to store ours in peoples outdoor toilets "". general 3 : "" oh...we used to dream of outdoor toilets . woulda ' been palaces for us . we used to store ours in old septic tanks on top of a rubbish tip . their version of maintenance was being every morning havin rotten fish dumped all over them ."""
2944,"warehouses ? nah , enterprising generals and colonels sold that shit gf ages ago ."
2945,it was rotted in the 80's during the ' cold war '
2946,what they have most of is boots !
2947,"we can probably assume that the military situation is not as bad as the civilian one as the kremlin would enforce whatever supplies , skills and labor are directed there first . which is not to say that they aren't struggling . > this is russia's last chance to do something like this , and putin knows it . for a decade or so , at least . one of the notable things is around a month ago , russia mobilized their training units and military instructors and sent them off to ukraine where they presumably got slaughtered . they destroyed their own ability to rebuild their armed forces for the sake of a few more men on the front . their short term ability to reinforce their attacks is severely depleted ."
2948,add the terrible demographics to this . and its was the last ever attempt at expansion .
2949,"to add irony to this matter : russia is also extremely dependent on ukraine for parts . [ article from 2014 ]( > russia requires ukrainian-produced gears for 60 percent of the surface combatants planned for its navy, > ukraines motor-sich plant manufactures jet engines for russian transport aircraft , engines for all russian combat and transport helicopters and auxiliary power units for many types of aircraft and helicopters . ukraine also makes auxiliary equipment , such as hydraulics and drogue parachutes , for advanced russian fighters such as the su-27 , su-30 and su-35 . > ditto for the missiles carried by those fighters . ukrainian companies manufacture the r-27 air-to-air missile as well as seekers for the r-73 ."
2950,special measures the box of bandaids has arrived
2951,"nobody knows th real extent of the losses . might be more , might be less . i personally think that ukrainian numbers , especially about equiptment are relatively reliable , because they have huge fluctuations and also "" bad "" days when they cannot report triumphant success . also , oryx confirmed numbers of destroyed russian equipment are actually in line with the ukrainian reported numbers , because oryx only uses visual confirmation , which sometimes is a rare commodity , since so much russian equipment is destroyed without a single photo ever being taken . i assume that at least 66 % of the losses of ifv , btrs and mlrs are not documented , because they are either low priority targets or far from the front lines ( mlrs ), which will not be documented for obvious reasons . but still confirmed numbers are relatively high , and if you add another 200 % on top ( the 66 % not visually confirmed ) you come rather close to ukrainian numbers . at any rate , my 66 % is just a rough guessimate , could be 50 or 75 . but the main point is : russian losses are certainly much higher than confirmed losses ."
2952,"the 11th yes , but that is below italy , france and the uk alone . not to mention the extreme number of nuclear weapons they're upkeeping and staggering corruption rotting their capabilities , and how much of that economy comes from delivering to the west - it's not just the west suffering from gas and oil shutoffs additionally gdp does not equal gdp you can leverage - they have only about 10k per capita , and a lot of it is locked up in keeping that capita like , alive . nato countries have a lot of fat to leverage into production , russia does not"
2953,keep in mind though the armies of corruption licking their chops over this once in a lifetime opportunity to steal everything not nailed down
2954,"if landmass mattered as much as you say , canada would be a great power . russia has their own gas , oil and ore , they wouldn't even need to purchase much from africa , that much is true . what they severely lack is specialized personnel to do much of value with those resources . that's their bottleneck , and i have a feeling that their tinpot dictator friends in africa and latin america aren't going to be of much help in the competent workforce department . these types of problems kind of come with being a glorified gas station for almost half a century ."
2955,"i dont know but now they are clearly prioritizing war production over everything else , which isnt good for their already decaying economy . bit like nazi germany , really . im just waiting for the slave laborers to pop up ."
2956,"yes , that's the big trick that i have no faith in them being able to pull off ."
2957,they could've used the superior trebuchet
2958,"i hope so but the war has shown that both sides keep finding ways to counter changes on the battlefield . himars are being used to take out high value targets at the moment not artillery but the ammo . what if russia starts breaking those up into smaller batches or moves them further back and adds more vehicles to deliver the shells ? also maybe they start spreading out their units who are deeper in enemy lines more and move hqs back . my point is , don't count the enemy out ."
2959,proceeds to blow one up in a silo due to maintenance issues
2960,those are probably in great condition as well / s
2961,attack of the drones
2962,"yes , i too get all my military hardware information from 4 year old websites with anonymous bylines and anonymous godaddy.com domain registration ."
2963,there are ukrainian positions near rostov ? isn't that way up by sumy ... or in russia ?
2964,"i'm not in charge . if i were though , i'd make a huge deal about the bridge , and talk about it a lot to draw the aa defenses and troops to protect the bridge down there , and away from the conflict . do you think maybe the smokescreen is cover for them removing their aa defenses ?"
2965,"i always heard it was the name for a broad range of measures that all have the end goal of providing military deception . camo , misinformation , propaganda , dummies , decoys ... anything that misleads the enemy , especially regarding the presence , actions of , and disposition of forces . this understanding of maskirovka doctrine among western observers does go back to the cold war . not sure where this 1985 report got it , but they talk about it as if it was known about long before that . interesting ."
2966,"deliberate and planned deception , often on a grand scale ."
2967,"first time i remember seeing it , was in red storm rising , by tom clancy and larry bond , written in 1986 ."
2968,"wiki but yes , i agree that "" maskirovka "" in this sense sounds weird to a russian-speaker ."
2969,the metro stations look really nice though .
2970,just get them to shoot them at themselves and problem fixes itself
2971,can't really blame them because people want to hear good news buy you also have to the reality .
2972,last i checked ukrain is lossing 1k people a day and falling back in donbas
2973,"i don't want to be a friend of murders , socio-/pyschopaths and hidden ego , abusive-people , which step over corpses to get their bloody money .."
2974,""" even better that a lot of russian equipment has western-(copied ) high-tec incorporated .. - it's more or less difficult to maintain this stuff , without ( official ) western-rtfm-supplier-survice . : d """
2975,"yeah but ussr stocks enough for lifetime , maybe you mean some technological stuff dunno"
2976,is it loled or lolled ?
2977,"20 years ago i spoke with my some fiend from usa , i tried to explain how wrong doing america's business buying even small stuff supply from china,(not talking how bad to give electronics knowledge ) even i bought cowboys belt i thought it's made in the usa , later i find out what made in china , thanks good what i asked where is made buckle ( is from arizona ), so usa customer service build china economy :)"
2978,there was an interview with one of the himars crews i saw on here yesterday that said they've struck 6 different russian command centers/ammo dumps so far(with drone confirmation ). that was with one of the 4 crews .
2979,yeah the ' good news ' portion is that such a move reflects some level of desperation . the bad news obviously is that it means a lot of resources to be thrown against ukraine . hopefully it also means a massive increase in russian civil unrest and the degradation of their combat effectiveness and morale .
2980,"yep , i appreciate you . i'm not sure who is winning and losing is so clear , right now . russia is sacrificing a lot to make slow gains in so-called lnr , while ukraine leverages defense in depth to exact a huge cost on them . but , regardless , the situation is dire , and is only going to get worse before , hopefully , it eventually gets better . safety and health for your friend and everyone else ."
2981,and let's not forget the temperature range in many parts of russia is jumping from - 50 celsius at winters to + 40 on summers .
2982,"is there a worse place than a field in siberia to store tanks ? humidity , freezing temperatures at winter , sweltering in summer those tanks are hulks and a small minority are barely usable to shore up a trench"
2983,someone probably stole the warehouses . they were worth more than the rusting equipment inside that had been pillaged decades before .
2984,hehe true and thrilling
2985,makes one question the security and reliability of their strategic systems as well
2986,""" we're very lucky they're so fucking stupid """
2987,"tires will rot after twenty years or so , even if stored in favorable conditions . tires , radiator hoses , belts , batteries , lubricants , hydraulic fluids , and electrical insulation , all have finite life expectancy . ignoring them for 30 + years is not helpful . ( even without corruption and theft .)"
2988,yup . they sabotage themselves much better than anyone from outside could . 
2989,"oh yeah that makes total sense kill your instructors , and in two months you'll have to resort to untrained conscripts having to train other conscripts ."
2990,do you have a source ?
2991,this should have been the red flag we should have seen and knew russia doesn't know what they were doing . how can a nation invade another that they are dependent on and think sanctions wouldn't hurt when they need so many exports from nations that are going to get pissed ?
2992,"oryx numbers is what i'm being my "" feeling "" on . it's confirmed how accurate the numbers are . and like you said , we only know the losses mostly from regain territory , otherwise they are pulling out back to russia . plus we keep seeing trains and trains of equipment heading to the war zone , all that hardware isn't still working on the front lines ! lol"
2993,worth noting the casualty figure doesn't include those wounded to the extent that they're incapacitated .
2994,trebuchet ? sounds like a nato weapon to me
2995,"doing all that reduces their combat effectiveness and strains their resources and logistical network , achieving the desired result . if there's no large ammo dumps or hqs in range , hit the smaller ones , and the garrisons , and the forward operating bases , and even the individual vehicles ( especially the air defenses , electronic wafare and counterbattery radars that are more likely to be sat still )"
2996,"i think even the most corrupt world leaders would know to at least put some aside to maintain the nukes . putin isnt stupid , im betting the nukes , at the minimum , have been taken care of ."
2997,even 1 % working would be enough .
2998,it only takes one to change the world forever .
2999,apparently each nuke needs millions of dollars worth of maintenance a year just to keep it functioning . one of the many reasons being plutonium cores build up an oxide coating over time that can dramatically reduce the size of the explosion . i'd bet that any money put aside for proper maintenance of these nukes has been pocketed over the past 30 years .
3000,the ukraine war episode 1 : the russian menace
3001,"i get my information from reading military literature for the last 15 years . it's not a secret . everybody knew that m777s aren't fit for this purpose up until washington gave the order to start releasing propaganda about wonder-weapon shipments to ukraine . it's a matter of design philosophy . americans/brits replaced steel components with titanium ones , sacrificing reliability for lower weight , because as the world's biggest warmonger , they have a new war to fight in some far-flung corner of the world with fucked up transpory infrastructure every other week . meaning , these things need to be airlifted easily , and anyways , american airpower ensures that the m777's limited ability to sustain fire is compensated for by other assets . ukraine isn't fucking afghanistan . they have rail , bridges , and plenty of trucks . what they need is cold war era howitzers that are designed to fire for months with little maintenance to shred enemy mechanised divisions , not fancy modern shit like the m777 that needs a new barrel every other day because it's designed to atomise fucking third world peasants in flip-flops organised in small insurgent squads with a couple of shells from 30km aways . same thing with those caesars . they don't even have armour . france in the 90s decided that we will never have to face a serious foe again , cut the military budget , and then realized that there is no money left to modernise our auf1s . solution ? design a poor man's spg , without armour , and on a civilian renault truck chassis , cause why the fuck not ? we only have to fight colonial wars with tribes in africa now that the soviets killed themselves . and for some reason this product of military budget cuts is being touted as yet another wonder-weapon that will save ukraine after the french military spent 20 years crying that it's a fucking death trap for french troops , please revive the auf1"
3002,> isn't that way up by sumy . no . by mariupol . i was thinking of krasnodar in any case . the assault on the ukrainians positions in rostov is carried out by the brave troops of the melitopol and berd'ians'k garrisons . > or in russia ? that's the joke .
3003,"my dude , wikipedia exists . ["
3004,"yes , and this word , maskirovka , never , never-never used to describe such things in russian language . that's why i'm a bit lost on why it is in english speaking communities . there are different words for what you mentioned , and "" maskirovka "" is just what leafs on you helmet that make it less visible are usually called . ah okay , i am not alone , even russian wiki mentions it . > . maskirovka [2 ]. > in english , the russian word "" maskirovka "" is sometimes used in transliteration form . to denote the overarching role of camouflage in soviet military doctrine . i guess some scholar decided it sounds cool and it got popular , sometime during cold war ."
3005,"yep . a lot of people here belive "" run out of weapons , ammo and they are close to collapsing "" bullshit . untill they are driven out of ukraine they are not defetead ."
3006,"1944 , patton , recorded signals traffic , fake landing craft and the germans were still waiting for the assault across the dover straights a couple of months after d-day . deception requires remarkable planning , coordination and cooperation . and persuasion , especially persuading patton to lead a fake army rather than land on d-day . the british . devious ? us ?"
3007,yes . it's one of the ways you get out of moscow ! ;)
3008,"lol , source:trust me bro . im guessing you rarely think things through before opening your mouth . but thanks for the laughs !"
3009,lold
3010,lol'd
3011,the u.s . outsourced its manufacturing to china because of short term profits . it was so short-sighted . lenin was right : a capitalist will sell you the rope you can use to hang him .
3012,"most manufacturing is moving back to north america . mexico is much better than china . closer to the usa , labour is cheaper and better quality ."
3013,if there's one thing trump did right it was taking on china . i fear we've passed a point of no return .
3014,good
3015,mmm thermal stress
3016,"there are stories ( all in russia ) of two ships propellers , a rail bridge and a 50km road being stolen ( in separate incidents ), so a warehouse probably isnt too much of a step up to steal ."
3017,"they were also chinese make due to deals with their friends to the east . now a lot of tires are , but it seems these ones were of the most basic quality and deteriorated even faster ."
3018,"for how long though ? pretty hard to defend stolen territory with starved men , and no equipment ."
3019,""" yah , but you try an tell the young conscripts of that today , and they won't believe you ..."""
3020,"scraping the bottom of a barrel . a sacrifice you can only ever do once . given the sheer lack of progress from russia , even after dropping their offensive to one major focus on lysychansk , and they're struggling to win there , we may be seeing the turning point ."
3021,"here's the first google result , but there's a lot more"
3022,this is another argument for the idea that russia thought they could barge in and install a puppet regime .
3023,"the general rule in war is you take the reported numbers and reduce it by about 75 %. there you get something close to reality . aside from propaganda and the need to keep up morale , the same kill tends to be reported by multiple persons which then invariably get added together . everything is neither as good nor as bad then is reported ."
3024,"i guess what i am saying is that their switch in tactics and by brining in more hardware and artillery and focusing on their supply lines they were able to make drone attacks less effective and reduce the number of tanks they were loosing a day . who knows what will be next . also i am sure they are hardening some of their logistics in captured areas , as ukraine is only able to attack 40miles in or so most of the time ."
3025,"to add : a hydrogen bomb has tritium ( radioactive hydrogen isotope with 2 neutrons in the nucleus ). that tritium has a half-life of 12.5 years and needs to be replaced regularly in the nuclear warhead to ensure it will produce the intended explosive yield if fired . if the tritium in the warhead decays and is not replaced , the hydrogen bomb becomes a regular atom bomb ( much lower explosive yield with just the atom-splitting fission process , no explosive boost from the atom-fusion process the tritium is used for )."
3026,the us spends more per year maintaining each warhead than the russians spend on their entire arsenal
3027,"even if they are all duds at this point , just launching them will ensure multiple countries respond with nuclear missiles ."
3028,[ relevant .
3029,starring vlad the imp as daft putler
3030,oh . heh .
3031,my link is in the sources in that wiki entry .
3032,"english is a thief language . we steal words and make them our own . its because we are an industrious people , not like the french for example - they dont even have a word for entrepreneur !"
3033,"take a look at the wiki page in english for "" russian_military_deception "". part of it is the term "" military deception "" in english is much more broad than camouflage . i think essentially zhukov used it like once in ww2 and it stuck in english ."
3034,"and then people wonder how russians are manipulated . dude , have you seen what's going on and what is the situation ? \- ukrainian army is dying , they say it themselves . \- they have no ammo . ffs , even in training centers for volunteers they have 1 rifle for 6 people \- donbass is lost \- ukr is unable to take back kherson . so we can laugh about stupid orcs , old t72 , and jerk off watching videos of himars , but ukraine is currently losing the war , people are deported by millions in siberia . i have friends on the battlefield . our neighbors refugees want to go back to kyiv next week . im not sure i will see them again . and then a russian colleague anti putin ( escaped the country few years ago ) tells me that our propaganda is worse than the russian one , because you underestimate them a lot . and then i come here and read comments from people who seem to talk about a netflix series just open your eyes folks . we have to help ukraine win , russia must be defeated . my friends must not die . but so far , ukrainian is losing , actually their army is almost defeated if no west ammo . russia is winning . and if you check outside the west , it seems that the rest of the world is not annoyed at all , a lot are even happy . this is just the beginning . it will be hard , extremely hard , but we will win . let's just not fall under our own propaganda ."
3035,"> trust me bro [ up to 1,000 ukrainian soldiers are being killed or wounded each day in the donbas region of eastern ukraine , with 200 to 500 killed on average and many more wounded , a top ukrainian official said on wednesday .!]( even ukrain source says it's 1k , meaning vit da much higher"
3036,laughed out loud-ed ...
3037,"just addressing lenin , true but at some point bots making bots will kill capitalism . until then it's the only viable method of improving living conditions for all of us . like what's happening in china as we speak and already happened to the dictatorship's free and more wealthy per capita neighbours . capitalism is a self-propelled sewer , hospital and school installation device . communism is flights of fancy that can only work with the help of robots because fat and happy humans at rest tend to stay at rest . re bots , food production and housing shouldn't be far off . at some point we'll reach a limit on new super yachts due to environmental and traffic concerns ."
3038,"it's only shortsighted in historical context and time frame . it still worked for decades and it worked beautifully for the people who made the outsourcing(and the global economy too , really )."
3039,"from a national view ( rather than from individual company quarterly report view ), this always made sense . it simultaneously helps mexico , which will be a good thing in itself for the us ."
3040,"he didnt , he just hurt us businesses . what was "" right "" is what he didnt do , retrain the rust and manufacturing belt so they can be part of the modern economy and provide longer and better unemployment for those laid off from factory work . then his big wisconsin foxxconn plant was a huge bust that i believe now will actually cost the taxpayer . and has been scaled from "" big factory "" to "" kinda sorta still making things but mostly offices and customer service jobs ."" which are exactly the jobs we should have been training people for before doing all this tariff nonsense . any pain china felt just meat places like vietnam and thailand took over those markets and sold their goods to the usa . it didnt result in the usa creating manufacturing jobs because of our incredibly high cost of living compared to asia . on the us side , smaller family owned farms were hit hardest and further subsidizes didn't help , and many were sold to big agriculture . also many farms characterized as "" family farms "" are hundred or thousands of employees and they received subsidies they didn't need , but the smaller farms couldn't survive . tariffs in the end cost more jobs than they "" saved ."" trump's every single policy was a economic , debt , or moral failure . easily the worst modern administration , and that's ignoring all the criminality ."
3041,"except he didn't take on china . trump did trump . he told us he was the best , he made noise . and he put on tariffs that cost american farmers billions of dollars ."
3042,his trade war hurt more than helped . reason was correct but execution was stupid .
3043,"~~ even his maga hats were made in china afaik . he played it , but used china as cheap supplier ~~ looks like this is not true and made-in-china maga hats were not official"
3044,"he took them on by having more of his signature merchandize produced there - win/win for him , loose/loose for us/china ."
3045,it was one of the very few reasons i applauded him .
3046,"i don't know if they're sending all 6 missiles at once or if they're hitting targets with 1 or 2 , but either way russian ammo can go fuck itself"
3047,materials love it .
3048,how do you steal 50km of road ?
3049,"its a bot , its spamming the same thing ."
3050,"well when i say warehouse it was only a hole in the ground covered by a piece of tarpolin , but it was a warehouse to us ."
3051,"ah yes , the "" four oryolmen "" sketch ."
3052,"i liked the article , however it was written in the end of may about what russia allegedly planed to do . i wonder if there's any info/proof that they have actually followed through with this sensless plan . could they really be that desperate and short-sighted ???"
3053,"hence the fact that we're talking about verifiable numbers via evidence . we're saying we have x verified killed , and extrapolating a probable total number of kills based off of it . i.e . it's not possible to have photo evidence of every vehicle kill . but if you have evidence of 2,000 vehicle kills , you can guess the real number is maybe 2,500-4,000 , that guess is based on how likely it would be to have evidence of kills . stuff in the back lines would be rarer to get recorded , thus the total number will be notably higher than what is verified . for vehicles on the front line the number is probably lower since we're more likely to get evidence of it ."
3054,ukrainian command asks for photo evidence if possible to get it reported .
3055,you cant harden against an m31 rocket barrage without bringing in cement trucks and rebar .
3056,he may sit on the military council but we do not appoint him the rank of master....strategist i'll take my ban now
3057,english has the linguistic purity of a prostitute
3058,except i'm pretty sure ' entrepreneur ' is a french word..at least it's spelling looks like it came from the french .
3059,"alright , answer was one wiki page away , thank you . good example of why it's so confusing to me is sentence like this from same wiki page "" the 2014 annexation of crimea was described in the west as maskirovka ."" very confusing since when i read it i insert actual russian meaning behind this term in my head and then it starts to sound strange ."
3060,"amusingly enough marx actually said "" you need to have capitalism first to develop things before you can have communism , communism will only happen when a place is advanced enough to be physically able to provide for everyone ."" literally everyone that ever tried a communist revolution promptly ignored that bit ."
3061,"> capitalism is a self-propelled sewer , hospital and school installation device . hospitals making you bankrupt and schools requiring massive amounts of debt unless some bleeding heart leftists demand things done differently ."
3062,mexico is the most important nation for the usa . i expect a change in us drug policy to weaken the cartels and possibly us troops in mexico to destroy them .
3063,"well these are two distinct issues . the concentration of manufacturing in china is absolutely a problem . he had the absolutely right intent in mind . his approach ... well we all know he's a bull in a china shop . supply chains ** have ** started to diversify away from china . slowly , but they have started . do we need a more comprehensive approach including other western allies ? absolutely . the idea of bringing manufacturing back to the us ? that is a crock of shit . anybody who believed that is a moron . its basic economics . its cheaper to make elsewhere . "" elsewhere "" should just mean more than 99 % concentration in china . you only make things in western countries that require precision and superb quality that the consumers of those products are willing to pay for ."
3064,tariffs are just a fancy name for taxes that you pay . trump was easily played by the more crafty ccp
3065,"the tariffs forced businesses to at least diversificate - move some of the factories to other countries , not just china . and thats good . yes , it was basically a 20 % tax on americans buying chinese goods ."
3066,that's not true . you're following the logic that handed china our balls in the first place . manufacturing moved there because it's cheaper . it's obviously going to hurt leaving
3067,"yes , the only way to hurt china was to form a multi-lateral agreement with a lot of like-minded countries , instead what was done was some haphazard tariffs and alienation of other trade partners , often times sending them towards china . it was haphazard at best and actively helped china at worst ."
3068,so clearly biden rolled tariffs back right ? he didn't . want to tell me why ?
3069,that has been debunked several times fwiw .
3070,what did he do ? and how did it work ?
3071,thermal stress has what materials crave !
3072,they want to break free
3073,"not to worry , the russian army have been conducting special fundraising operations for years to protect the materials by transporting them safely to the black market"
3074,> steal 50km of road
3075,"i know , and he gets paid 50 cents a comment . let's slowly rob the russian government ."
3076,but no-one expected the russian inquisition .
3077,ours were evicted from ** their ** hole in the ground .
3078,you stored yours in a warehouse ? we had to store ours in a ** lake **!
3079,"i didn't find links saying this had been done . many saying that it could be planned , but not more ."
3080,"just doesnt work that way . when you see a picture of a purportedly destroyed vehicle you have no idea if it was recovered and repaired . in the history of warfare everyone , and i mean everyone , overestimates enemy casualties and under reports their own . i see no reason why this one is any different . dont believe me now , but wait until this is over . youll see what i mean ."
3081,unfortunately that means nothing . see my earlier post . i know people want to believe but this is a bit of a science . this happens in the rey warevery one . each side knows the true figure only for its own forces and they arent talking .
3082,you can move your equipment back and put it in tunnels etc ... you can bring a lot more smaller vehicles in so you have less targets . you can move things around more frequently . you can take out the m31 with a rocket . lots of things they can do to adapt .
3083,somehow putin returned .
3084,resilient and widely used ?
3085,"this is the complete and proper answer .. its what makes english a very difficult language to learn...ffs , the meaning of words change from year to year ."
3086,thatsthejoke.jpg
3087,"> literally everyone that ever tried a communist revolution promptly ignored that bit . that's the issue with marxism in practice . iirc marx was fuzzy on how to get from capitalism to communism , but seemed to think it would just morph into it . lenin basically said "" look , we don't have all the conditions right for communism to take root now , but with a dedicated enough cadre we can skip that stage and make it happen ."" mao took it a step further by basically saying "" urban proletariat ? meh . a dedicated cadre can do it with peasants ."" basically if you have to have a revolution , you're doing it wrong ."
3088,"not really . lenin knew that completely collecivising everything when the soviet union was still mostly agrarian and not industrialised was wrong , hence the creation of the nep ( removed by stalin basically instantly with horrendous consequences ). to transition from capitalism to socialism ( and later to communism ) market socialism is the answer , which vietnam and china currently have implemented . make no mistake , market socialism is only a transition towards a socialist economy ."
3089,not every country is like the us .
3090,sounds like you need to move to a first world country ;).
3091,"it will take either lots and lots of state sponsored violence with reduced rigour for prosecution , i.e . go to them and just kill them all , no court needed ( which nowadays and for good reasons is quite frowned upon ), or it will take decades to turn the current situation around . sadly ."
3092,"it evens the price difference . if you are going to spend 199 $ for tv from china , or 199 $ from american built ?"
3093,it was a tidbit . what trump should have done was sign the trans pacific partnership . the tpp was a years long effort to build up defense against china and we abandoned our allies .
3094,tariffs are shooting yourself in the foot hoping to cause more egregious harm to your perceived opponents with the ricochet . it doesn't get much dumber than that .
3095,chinas exports to the us went up under trump .
3096,please give some evidence that trump's actions of any sort harmed china . they cost the u.s . billions upon billions . trump spent my tax dollars to pay off the farmers so they would still vote for him . but nothing helped american manufacturing .
3097,correct . any economist could tell you the tariffs wont work without proper execution . the best route would be what you suggest and also a shift of manufacturing to democracy friendly countries . going after china is a multi decade affair not a random after thought .
3098,the eu alone takes 20 years to develop a negotiating stance to start bargaining with . and without europe what would be the point in forming an alliance of trade negotiations ? the people bashing on trump really had no idea what they were talking about .
3099,"listen , this isnt a biden or trump thing . this is a tariffs dont hurt china that much thing . the approach of a tariff war is extremely short sided . doing tariffs rashly wont solve anything in the short or long term . im very much in favor of an anti ccp stance since ( and i been harping on this even before russia invaded ukraine ) china is the only badguy super power remaining . russia clearly fell off a cliff ages ago . appeasement towards china had to stop and i fully endorse that . but to slap on some random tariffs and call it mission accomplished is stupid . thats not what taking a firm stance to bad ccp behavior entails . taking on china would take a concentrated effort with a multi decade plan . you think china sprouted overnight ? to get to where they are currently , it took 25 * years *. for us to combat china , it would take a coordinated multinational effort to move manufacturing bases and reliance on chinese goods . you cant do that overnight with tariffs . you also cant whip up resistance to the west with such stupid clearly racist mocking language . there were plenty of chinese more sympathetic to the west and that goodwill went to shit with trump antics . he made china much more nationalistic than before ."
3100,because once they are in place the damage is done i suspect . if he rolls them back do you think prices change ? thats not how things work . we all know that .
3101,we've also wanted to keep tariffs in place because china was treating our australian friends like sh **.
3102,im very anti-trump . folks downvoting you for telling the truth are not helping . it just helps the right point to it and call us liars .
3103,"updated , thanks"
3104,trade tariffs .
3105,you mean they have been using a decentralised storage system where all items are distributed either partially or in total over a wide area ? that's totally brilliant ! no enemy will ever be able to get their hands on that equipment . it's going nowhere !
3106,if only all that ingenuity could be harnessed in an entrepreneurial manner .
3107,"i understand , but this war has a lot more cameras - it becomes easier to produce photographic evidence ."
3108,"you cant realistically shoot down any appreciable number of m31 rockets in flight , they just move too fast and there are often too many of them , not to mention having to put air defense vehicles literally everywhere to even hope to start shooting any down . bringing out smaller vehicles doesnt make any sense unless they plan to switch to pickup trucks instead of bmps . digging tunnels to store tens of thousands of tons of munitions takes lots of time and engineering and is easily disrupted by striking the tunnel entrances and burying it . moving it back makes it harder to get gear and orders to the front . point is everything that they do to adapt will cause a significant disruption and complication to combat operations , which is the whole point of the exercise , then you move on to disrupt something else if none of the usual targets are available ."
3109,okeydokey...i missed it ..
3110,no america's special skill is delivering mediocre healthcare at twice the cost of any other first world county due to a combination of greedy bastards and idiots who think free market healthcare is a workable idea .
3111,"i think the first step will be to dry up their income stream . decriminalisation of all drugs and legalisation of most will greatly harm their income . federal legalisation of shrooms , lsd , mdma , cannabis and anything else but the opioids should be the first step . if they have no money their power will be greatly reduced ."
3112,he never did anything to protect american intellectual property .
3113,"and trump pulled out of the tpp , which * helped * china ."
3114,"there's definitely been a measurable diversification of our supply chains away from china . was that a pyrhhic victory ? i'd say yes . the idea that would have brought manufacturing back to the us was complete bullshit . to be clear , i said the one thing he did right was taking on china . i didn't say i agreed with his approach . but biden is only now considering rolling tariffs back and only because of this out of control inflation ."
3115,"the tpp ? trump , the "" master negotiator "" give china a huge gift without asking for anything in return . isn't that the first rule of negotiation , give the other party everything they want without asking for anything in return ?"
3116,"some people say trump is a stupid , misogynistic , racist , law breaking , duplicitous , economically illiterate , diplomatically nave , wannabe dictator who's in hock to every bad actor you can think of . for all her manifest faults i'd take von der leyen any day ."
3117,"if the tariffs only hurt us and not china , then how would that help australia ? can't just have it go whichever way serves your argument at the moment . that's called lying ."
3118,"i'm actually anti-trump myself , but bullshit is bullshit"
3119,"if we don't know where our tanks our , they can't know where they are"
3120,"well , lets see how it turns out in the end . while i agree there are more phones and cameras , there are vastly more ways to create doctored images . remember the ghost of kiev and for how long did the kills of this entirely fictitious construct get added to the kill numbers ?"
3121,"im not entirely convinced that it works as well as we would wish . the mafias didnt cease to exist when alcohol once again became legal , they just moved to other things to make money from . on top of that , cocaine is now every mans drug , unlike 20 years ago when it was a rich mans drug . this makes it a matter of letting the cartels keep what is likely the biggest income , or you have to legalise cocaine too ."
3122,the gop gave up governance ages ago . trump never showed the slightest interest of any sort in actually dealing with an issue .
3123,yup that pissed me off so much . pull out of an imperfect asian trade deal that was american lead so that an asian trade deal lead by china happens wtf
3124,and i'm saying that he didn't take on china . he said stuff and make things expensive for americans but it was all surface . the tariffs didn't help . and the chinese retaliation was expensive .
3125," it's ` kyiv `, not ` kiev `. support ukraine by using the correct spelling ! [ learn more ]( ___ [^( why spelling matters )]( ^(|) [^( merch for charity )]( ^(|) [^( stand with ukraine )]( ^(|) ^( i'm a bot , sorry if i'm missing context )"
3126,well with how many nato launchers and missiles have been left behind by the ukrainians this was bound to happen at some point . im just surprised it hasnt happened sooner .
3127,return to sender !
3128,at least some of my tax dollars are put to some use here . lol
3129,once again the americans are supplying both sides with weapon's to fight .
3130,god bless america
3131,the tables are turning in southern parts of ukraine in favor of the russian federation . this was bound to happen with the nato weaponry captured lately
3132,"weird how russian commentary on javelins up to this point was one of the following : 1 ) old and didnt work 2 ) complicated to use , so didnt work 3 ) ineffective against tanks , so didnt work ( re : scott ritter claiming russian tank crews had been hit by up to 5 javelins and walked away is that narrative changing ?"
3133,how the turntables
3134,"lol , nothing can be seen being hit in the video and are you sure that's a russian soldier ?"
3135,is it possible javelins made their way through the black market into russian hands ?
3136,you mean on russian armor ? the same armor that the ukrainians found abandoned north of kiev .
3137,they'll be shotting himars at them soon .
3138,"may have orders not to use them , booby traps . but , at the speed all this is happening i doubt there has been time for that nor is it easy to do on a modern weapon ."
3139,"from what i've heard the russians aren't that impressed with the javelins , finding the nlaws and another western-manufactured atgm ( forget which ) to be superior . earlier in the conflict when it was still cold i saw reports from the ukrainians that they had battery issues . the russian claims could just be propaganda though . hard to say at this point ."
3140,"they have loads of this stuff captured , i'm seeing photos of captured launchers for like 2 months at least now . a few weeks ago there was a training video from lpr about nlaw training . the reason why don't they use them very often is unclear to me . there were some posts in t about these launchers being very unreliable and hard to use in this environment , also some complain that batteries are depleted and the rockets themselves nearing their expiration date . but these are just claims in t ."
3141,"based off what ive read , most of them get taken for analysis and then it seems they would like to arm potential enemies of the us/nato . i know russia is sending a force to nicaragua , so seeing cartels armed with captured javelins or nlaws doesnt seem too far fetched in my mind . im sure whatever force we fight next well be very well equipped by the russians as a retaliation for the support in ukraine theres also reports of these weapons being sold on the black market by both sides . who knows where they will end up"
3142,traitor alert
3143,"yeah ... i wonder when ukrainians and russians would team up on them ? because clearly usa started this war ( by slowly making ukraine nationalist ), supported it ( by dropping weapons there ) and is making it last longer ( they stated it themselves ). they need war so they could hide crisis in their country ."
3144,usa usa usa
3145,so basically nato weaponry is a game changer for russia ?
3146,"so nato weapons is a game changer over old soviet junk , got it mate"
3147,"yeah , no . russia isn't doing so well in the south ."
3148,"> don't cry when the nato weapons defeat rf because although they've captured , some will have been sabotaged and nato will be sending more until rf is defeated . the writing is on the wall . tick tock mf'ers . boom ! splat . reconquest . haha ."
3149,"considering how many russia has capture so far i don't find it weird for them to use them , especially the dpr ."
3150,why pay for javelins when you can get it for free ?
3151,more like isis and hezbollah getting javelins
3152,isn't all the armour used in this war soviet ?
3153,i doubt it's hard enough considering people once made ak mags with explosives
3154,perhaps . it is strange that the ukrainians have just left behind so many large caches of advanced weapons in places like severo and lysychansk ( especially the latter since they had quite a few days to pull out ). youd think a retreating army would destroy what they cannot bring with them but for some reason they dont and just leave them to be found by the russians .
3155,javelins are more for defense instead of offense .
3156,they might just not know how to use them . it's not that easy to use and definitely doesn't help out the untrained user . american troops sang praises for javelins in past conflicts .
3157,"> from what i've heard the russians aren't that impressed with the javelins , finding the nlaws and another western-manufactured ** atgm ( forget which )** to be superior . earlier in the conflict when it was still cold i saw reports from the ukrainians that they had battery issues . nlaw and ** panzerfaust 3 ** are newer . javelin are older and the version ukraine received hasn't been made since 2006 . but it still more than good for all the russian tanks . ukraine has literally destroyed/captured all the tanks russia originally sent for this invasion > the russian claims could just be propaganda though . hard to say at this point . javelin is better than anything russia is currently using in ukraine"
3158,"i'll explain why . ukriane just doesn't have much armor . maybe little vans , but mosly they are guerilla little tag teams on foot ."
3159,lol . thanks i needed a good laugh .
3160,yeah dude usa is to blame for this jesus fuck people
3161,this is a level of mental gymnastics that is rarely seen in the wild . almost impressive if it wasn't so insane .
3162,this comment is actually fucking ridiculous . it's like qanon level wacko
3163,thats not what he said .
3164,nato weapons couldnt help ukrainians so i doubt its a game changer for russia
3165,it's turning into an attrition war where russia can leverage their artillery superiority .
3166,"weren't nato weapons the game breaker for russia ? why wouldn't the same weapons that break the game , also change it ?"
3167,isn't it obvious ? of course nato has better weaponry than the russian federation in terms of their effectiveness
3168,"stuff literally designed to destroy soviet tanks , destroys soviet tanks . mindblowing ."
3169,"just because russia isnt making moves in the south doesnt mean theyre not doing good , they just havent launched a offensive"
3170,that doesn't really look like a dpr soldier to me .
3171,how many have they captured so far ?
3172,"if it was ruzzian , missle would do uturn and come back to launcher"
3173,soviet but not russian . minor difference .
3174,when one's retreating it's running for the life . doubt many give a damn about some weapons left behind that dont even belong to him
3175,ukrainian soldiers had hardly any vehicles to withdraw in . the ones they had hey filled to the brim with loot . so full they cant even take people in them .
3176,"good point . ukrainians are occasionally attacking in some parts of the line of contact , but for the most part russia is attacking and ukraine is defending ."
3177,"you could very well be right . the amount and quality of training in the ukrainian forces seems to vary * widely *, from troops who've received multi-week training by nato countries , to territorial defense forces where it seems they hand them a rifle , let them shoot it a couple times , and send them to the front . and similarly for the russians , if a unit captures a few of them they aren't going to know right away how to use it , and probably don't have too much reason to learn as the russians seem to have worked out most of their supply issues since phase ii of the invasion . > american troops sang praises for javelins in past conflicts . if it was iraq and the middle east , they probably never dealt with the cold weather battery issues , and would have had proper and thorough training . those factors combined could explain how it is a good weapons system , but not particularly useful to most ukrainians and russians in the current conflict ."
3178,"the javelin is amazing , as it is fire and forget , but it needs a bit of training ."
3179,good point . kornet or stugna are also more versatile
3180,this . there just isn't much to use them on
3181,"no the country that has been at war for its whole existence , has been involved in coups and interventions all over the place , has a sterling reputation for over throwing democratically leaders if they don't fit us national interests , and are now in a proxy war with there arch enemy ..... couldn't possibly have anything to do with this ."
3182,"yeah i mean have you seen the things the undersecretary of state victoria nuland has been caught saying since euromaidan ? realpolitik shit . picked the new leadership , kept out the original popular opposition leader , said "" fuck europe ."" they just want to keep everyone else down so the us can stay on top a little longer ."
3183,"yes it is , he said russia is winning because they have nato weapons"
3184,the russian kiev offensive didn't fare well to nato weapons ...
3185,"as far as aircraft and naval vessels , absolutely . but as far as artillery,tanks , and air defense i think russia edges western tech or at least sheer numbers . small arms are about even id say . remember that russia has always been a land based power and their doctrine reflects that . and with a war like this commanders , soldiers , and tactics are getting massive amounts of experience . russia may be the weakest of the three world powers but they are definitely pushing their weight around ."
3186,alot
3187,at least one
3188,""" loot ""?"
3189,"still though , its not like warehouses full of ammo , rpgs , and missiles are difficult to destroy . so it has to be either incompetence or extremely poor planning that nobody thought to just leave behind a few blocks of c4 with a timer slapped on top to torch the place after they leave ."
3190,"i'm not sure cold weather is a real problem , it affects batteries but doesn't degrade them permamently ( at least in principle ), and now it's very warm on the battlefields ."
3191,it is reusable
3192,"indeed ... the usa are located on the other side of the globe , why do they care about what is happening in russia and around it ? do they care , because their wealth depends on their expansionist politics , and the wealth is all they care ? they cover their quest for wealth by the claim of spreading democracy ."
3193,yeah victoria nuland is to blame for russia invading ukraine
3194,"the other guy said the us started the war in ukraine to hide the crisis in the us . and , the us will always be on top . if you don't like it and you live there then leave and go to a better country . i would really love to hear which country you choose by the way . lol"
3195,"no , he said the tables are turning , and then referencing the video he said this was bound to happen , as in russians were bound to start using nato weapons since they have more because of all the territory they are capturing . it would be crazy to think he was saying the tables are turning because of nato weapons when there is little footage of russians using nato weapons ."
3196,time will tell how kyiv fares lol
3197,like 50 or 1000 ?
3198,so like in-between zero and one ?
3199,"bicycles , home goods , microwaves . those kinds of things . ukrainians see donetsk residents as non-people so anything goes"
3200,"it is dangerous , and gives a hint to the other side that you are leaving .. better to do it silently ."
3201,let me dig through some videos to find them
3202,ok i posted it
3203,"agreed , certainly at this point in the conflict . i haven't seen any reports about battery issues since late winter/early spring ."
3204,yes it is and ?
3205,because millions of ethnic ukrainians vote in us elections
3206,"that's why putin invaded . it's kinda the same thing as bay of pigs and the cuba missile crisis . putin definitely is to blame too , don't get me wrong . but in the realpolitik sense , the us and nato made moves knowing this would likely happen ."
3207,but ... that's what he literally said .
3208,pretty clear that ship has sailed for russia...much like the moskva once did
3209,on the phone to putin now he will release numbers once he knows clewtext is asking
3210,i dont think the russians are revealing their accountings of captured hardware but there are videos here of captured javelins which you can freely sift through .
3211,at least yes .
3212,i feel like i've seen 50 on this sub alone .
3213,yes
3214,"honestly ive seen 50 different videos of russians showing off captured western equipment , some videos only had 2 launchers , some had 35 so my guess is russia captured about 700 + javelins and nlaws ? but honestly idk . but ive seen videos of russians and lpr/dpr training on them so they have enough"
3215,lol . ok bro . the propaganda here is insane .
3216,and it isn't fire and forget
3217,"what does that have to do with anything ?? he is saying the truth . only non-american people will see it that way . if not , what is the interest of usa in ukraine ?"
3218,denazification is why putin invaded get your story straight
3219,"this meant whats seen in the video , not what is reflected in his first sentence . its not a well-constructed statement ."
3220,yeh the situation in kyiv is great and will take off like the an225 . oh wait its not taking off ever lmao
3221,or all those repleneshing ships to snake island ...
3222,"so you are making assumptions , and have no idea...got it"
3223,so less than the amount of tanks ukraine has captured from russia ? how many ?
3224,so less than 1 %
3225,never seen more than 2-3 captured at one place . have any sources for larger numbers ?
3226,35 javelins ? care to share the source ?
3227,ukrainian propaganda is the worst ( most widespread ) as they have western media backing it up
3228,i posted the video
3229,it is fire and forget
3230,"> javelin it absolutely is fire and forget , that is the key design point of the system . fire and forget with top attack and frontal attack too ."
3231,that's not my story . both side really have a nazi problem . it's clear you want to be a grump instead understanding the big picture . have a nice day .
3232,"same kyiv russia failed to take incurring huge man/material losses ? lmao ... kyiv is much better off long term , only downside is the russian terrorist attacks on civilians in the short term ."
3233,good analogy . the an225 was destroyed by ukrainian artillery while it was also destroying russian vehicles that kept getting parked in the same spot .
3234,where did i make assumptions ? i didnt give you an exact figure so cry over it if you want
3235,i do not expect every captured javelin to show up on this sub .
3236,"same , it just seems like i've seen about 20 or so of these small captured positions . i could be overestimating ."
3237,"there is no source related to it , i was talking about literal videos ive seen of russian soldiers showing off captured equipment and some of the videos had only a few and some had a fuckton"
3238,""" whatabout """
3239,"it's one truck , where you have no idea whats beneath that layer of crap , with a bicycle in it . this doesnt support your assertion at all . please try and be more honest in the future ."
3240,ok
3241,i do not give a shit about your story you didn't invade ukraine . putin did and these were his reasons . if you want to invent other reasons on his behalf who the fuck cares they are not relevant > it's clear you want to be a grump instead understanding the big picture yes i know you are so smart and all knowing unlike us plebs who cannot see the 65-d chess some of you are capable of top minds ... go to r/conspiracy to see other like minded incredibly smart people just like you . they too see big pictures
3242,what ? i cant hear you over the sound of missiles dropping on military plants in kyiv . speak up
3243,"you said a lot . and you have no idea how many . could be 20 , could be a million . how much is a lot ? it's purely an assumption when you admit you don't know lol"
3244,"ok , so you have no idea either but think you counted 50 , got it"
3245,ill post more . basically ukrainian soldiers are doing in donbas what russians did in bucha .
3246,oh yeah i'm sure the us was completely hands off during euromaidan . that's so like us to not interfere covertly during regime change .
3247,"couldn't take it so retreated says what ? same in kharkiv ? yup . same in kharkiv . hmm , russia sure has lost a lot of occupied territory since march to a should be inferior opponent ..."
3248,> you said a lot . and you have no idea how many . i've seen at least half a dozen separate videos showing captured nato weapons of terror and i can absolutely confirm that it is a lot .
3249,if thats how you define alot then fair enough
3250,"i am half russian leaving abroad and i support my side because i think in the long term consequences of losing would be worse in the long run for my fellow russians . we are mostly responsible for the situation , even though nato and ukrainians have done some immoral bullshit as well . in the 2014 revolution , most ukrainians had noble intentions indeed , they wanted european wages and stronger democratic representation . the problem is that some western ukrainians used this government overthrow in order to dominate the eastern ukrainians . they were destroying soviet statues and banning the russian language for example , even if all eastern ukrainians spoke russian . you can definitely make the argument that dnr and lnr were created by the fsb , but 100s of thousands of the seperatists wouldnt have been mobilized for the russian side , if western ukrainians actually treated them well . there are also the nato and economic resources parts of the equation , which deserve entire books dedicated to them as well . now lets get to the war . seems to me that we will eventually win the donbass battle .., but what happens after that , remains to be seen , and it doesnt look to me that the ukrainian side is willing to accept any peace treaty without the donbass , the crimean lanbridge and the rest...so it is likely we are going to see a total war to the end ."

3253,"the rest of the world has lost some massive trusts on western governments with the way they handled this conflicts . from china , india , south east asia , to latin america to africa , we have seen how american and european governments are sacrificing the entire world economy and global food security just to spite on russia as dr . subramaniam jaishankar put it : "" europe has to grow out of the mindset that europe's problems are the world's problem but the world's problems are not europe's problems "". the fact is : ' russian invasion of ukraine ' to countries like china , brazil , india...etc ... isn't that much different to us's invasion on iraq , or saudi invasion on yemen . it was a continental or european issue , that they failed to resolve diplomatically when they have the chance , leading to a meaningless civilian suffering . instead of trying everything to end it , europe and america are actively prolonging this conflict on purposes and worsening it every steps of the way , leaving the entire world be damned just cause they fancy some dick waving contest with russia . ' but ... but ... russia ...' nah fk these russian blaming bs . the western governments doesn't give a fck about the rest of the world . if western governments spent as much efforts to shift foods out of ukraine as shifting weapons into ukraine , the global food security would have eased months ago . look at how quick the west bow down to erdogan , a dictator demand , just to spite russia . or bow at the bone saw prince who has been doing worse atrocities . or netanyahu . but can't even make a deal with russia to ease global fuel prices or global food security not to mention , the hypocrisy of singing about peace and freedom and democracy , while pouring more and more weapons into this conflict . just to remind that most of the historical bombings across africa , asia and latin america have been done or supported by these same european countries . literally the current global issue was done by the same guys , whom in the past , to defeat the nazi german and imperial japan , were starving out millions of people in india , china and south east asian . and they are happily doing it again this time too"
3254,"just found this sub , is this actually a neutral sub on reddit ?! got banned permanently from worldnews for the crime of posting russian territorial gains"
3255,"i dont really care about the war . that being said i dont think the us government shouldve sent up too 54 billion us dollars to ukraine , got that from nytimes . idk if this makes me neutral or pro-russian . im american , which is why i only said the us . i would say im neutral , but people here believe neutrality or non interference is taking a side . also idk how to add the tags neutral or , pro russian "
3256,"i want to thank the creators of this sub . this place is a safe haven really for discussion . yeah obviously each have their own biases , even i do for being ' neutral '. banter is present here which is great . its only recently that we are getting the true performance of armies during world war 2 . imagine that 80 years later that most historians have finally uncovered pretty much the whole extent of it . and you get pros on reddit going around with the good old ' mad man hitler made me do it ' salty nazi generals with stuff like russia won on their side because of winter . and i still see it to this date . in 10 years maybe less , when putin is gone , archives will be released and we will truely know if it was a cia non covert op proxy war or ethnic bullying by urkainians or russia grabbing ressources . the documentaries will come out big time and we will know ."
3257,"an interesting moment of the economic war . in a fit of hysteria , there are now accusations against russia that putin used gas supplies as a weapon and inflated prices . and that is why the countries of europe are now paying very dearly for gas , and putin earns a lot . did anyone think that all other suppliers also sell gas at a high price ? the united states , for example , or the same norway - do these countries sell gas at the old low prices ? certainly not . all gas sellers are rowing loot , but putin is the zloty here . but if someone has a good memory , he can remember that the europeans themselves , through the courts , canceled the prices for long-term contracts with gazprom , because at that moment the price on the stock exchange was falling and the europeans tied prices ( through the courts ) to the stock exchange . therefore , now gazprom sells gas for 5-7 times more expensive than usual . attention to the question - if you sell a product 5-7 times more expensive than usual , will you be sad if the sales of the product are even half as much as usual ?"
3258,"ukrainian take on lisichansk seemed to be confusing on one hand , there is clear video and footage of ukrainian soldiers withdrew and tried to form a defense line along the siversk and bakhmut highway . but on another the defenders of lisichansk and surrounding towns are still holing down their defensive positions , as they get slowly isolated , flanked and surrounded by russian troops unlike western portray , there is no glory in being surrounded , starve down and have to surrender enmassed to russia . if thousands of russian troops are surrounded and have to surrender enmass , the western media would have all laughed at how much of a bunch of losers they are the ukrainian should have given up severodonesk early and secure poppasna and toshikiva instead . severodonesk falling won't change the military board of the entire region . but the falling of poppasna and toshikiva are leading to the collapse of the entire donbass budge . quick counted and you could see 35 towns and villages have been lost directly due to russia taking poppasna and toshikiva . more important , lisichansk will fall soon , and the russia has finally breach the siversky donesk river"
3259,"i have seen 5 confirmed instances of ukrainian destroyed tanks and vehicles were passed around as russian tanks / vehicles just to inflate the later loss . not sure how many more are there , but i am sure that there are more than 5 this is my problem with counting the enemy's loss as main objective to win the war . just like in vietnam war , there will be incentive to inflate the number of enemy loss , and fail to predict the enemies capacity on the ground the russia did these things too , but they counted victory based on territories claimed . and yes , they inflate the number of towns that they took over too ( some were stated to be taken over , but later found to be still in ukrainian hands ). but these only work on their own population propaganda , and do not affect their long term military operation . ukraine meanwhile is banking on russia losing all their tanks and soldiers to wage war . if russian is losing less tanks and less men than ukraine believing , then ukraine war plan is busted"
3260,"experiencing first hand western propaganda . just so surreal the other day , sergei shoigu came to the front ordered generals to prioritise destroying ** ukraine's long-range missile and artillery weapons **. which is one of the ' sure , water is wet , captain obvious ' comment when it comes to ground war . western media : '* russia orders troops to target ukraines western-supplied long-range weapons as they reshaped the conflict '* redditors : '* why shogui is so obsessed with himars , the 8 himars system must be so effective that he is so afraid of them *'"
3261,"posted this on a different thread , but figured i'd drop it here . let me throw my hat in here . on every other sub ive been called a putinbot/troll/shill/etc . i am russian born to a ukrainian ( born in crimea ) mother and russian father . i have been in the us for 30 years now , consider myself an american . i speak russian fluently , understand ukrainian very well , and spent most of my early childhood in crimea ( kerch , feodosiya , etc ). i have family on both sides of this war . i have family in kiev , moscow , and still in crimea . it is my family , my people being killed on both sides of this war . it absolutely pisses me off how both countries i consider mine are being pitted against each other . i'm not going to get into the whole cia backing of the 2014 revolution , clear war crimes in donbas and luhansk , and the clear actions of nato , the eu and the us government to push the world to the edge of ww3 . people have been warning about this war for decades , even the current head of the cia said years ago that if we keep antagonizing russia , this is what will happen . yes , putin is a piece of shit , but to say there weren't legitimate reasons for the invasion is ridiculous , and i'm not talking about the denazification propaganda . there is enough blame to go around . placing the blame 100 % at russia's feet is naive at best . ukraine is not the beacon of democracy that the west says it is . the reason ukraine is so important to europe and the us , other than sticking a thumb in russia's eye , is it is the money laundering capital of the world . gangs , mafia , government , all take a slice of the pie . why do you think rand paul wanted the 40billion dollars of aid to be audited ? because he knows most of that shit will end up in peoples pockets . lets also not forget that what is happening in ukraine now , america has done multiple times . america destabilized the entire middle east with our imperialistic bullshit . we destroyed iraq , libya , syria . we funded terrorists and basically created isis . what kills me most about this whole situation is the hypocrisy of these people , blaming russia for doing shit many other countries have done in recent history . the only quick way out of this is a peace deal . that simple . its not ideal , but it will stop the killing and give russia and ukraine a ground to work from . problem is , when zelensky tried to put minsk 2 into action , azov absolutely refused orders . there are videos of this . zelensky was extremely close to making peace deals with russia multiple times the last few months , yet every time there was a visit from a european leader or a us politician to get him back in line . peace is not in the best interest of the us and europe . they are looking at this as a way to weaken russia permanently . again , enough blame to go around . unfortunately the msm will never be honest about this war . even after all of the lies about iraq , lies about trump , lies about everything , people still believe the shit they peddle . insanity"

3272,"how would the ukrainian people react to an announcement that zelensky has entered negotiations with the likely result being the recognition of crimea as russian territory , the recognition of donbas as autonomous/free to govern themselves , and the rewriting of its constitution so as to not join nato ever . would these three terms be acceptable to them ? likewise on the part of the russian people , would these three terms be acceptable as a final outcome to this conflict despite having to give back all territory gained outside of donbas and crimea ? because i have a feeling that the populaces of both countries would reject these terms . the ukrainians would obviously be infuriated that they lost these territories and all the thousands of troops that attempted to prevent it . and the russian people would likely reject them as well given that they too have lost thousands upon thousands of troops and weaponry to achieve the gains that they have currently achieved . and it might be a slap in the face to them to "" only "" come away with crimea and an "" autonomous "" donbas . they may consider everything east of the dnipro as the only acceptable outcome given the large economic and personal costs of the operation so far . this is likely why we have not had even a millimeter of progress on the diplomatic side since the talks in turkey several months ago . it is likely that only a decisive defeat on behalf of either side brings an end to this war . perhaps neither side has been given a mandate for peace ."

3274,"ukraine should have liquefied azov by force before this war , my biggest issue now is that western media went from calling them nazis everyday before this war to now calling them right wing extremists . because theyre on our side . just like the soviets in wwii i literally cannot understand why they cant swallow the ego and say yup , we have a nazi unitthat same nazi unit threatened to fight the government when they were asked to disband and its a problem . we made a mistake and we will now disband azov this is controversial but just because azov is defending their home doesnt make them good people , they are bad people and nazis deserve to die in that plant . its ironic though putin has sent wagner ( nazis ) in to fight them too . ( supposedly ) the information is ridiculously filtered with what we get too , and bucha was a false flag . ua government quietly confirmed liberation on march 2nd and no russian forces retook it . then in april they find fresh bodies on the streets of a town theyve controlled for a month ? give me a break , it helped raise the international support though as planned . edit : my above claim about bucha has been disproved , that statement is now incorrect"

3276,why is there no information at all about ukrainian casualties ? we hear all the time about how many russians died but never about the other side .
3277,"so i'm with another question to russian people . here i see that many of the russia supporters call foreign fighters being mercenaries , so justifying for their handling of such . so a ** question from me **: how do you define what is a mercenary and what isn't ? as i have been doing some digging , trying to justify foreign fighters being mercenaries and have come to this [ definitive guide of what is and isn't a mercenary ]( 1 . a mercenary shall not have the right to be a combatant or a prisoner of war . 2 . a mercenary is any person who : * ( a ) is specially recruited locally or abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict ; * ( b ) does , in fact , take a direct part in the hostilities ; * ( c ) is motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and , in fact , is promised , by or on behalf of a party to the conflict , material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of that party ; * ( d ) is neither a national of a party to the conflict nor a resident of territory controlled by a party to the conflict ; * ( e ) is not a member of the armed forces of a party to the conflict ; and * ( f ) has not been sent by a state which is not a party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces . two contentious points being ( a ), ( c ) and ( e ). ( a ) if * recruited * is the same as * volunteered * then this is criteria stands . ( c ) this is the point i see touted here the most . i did not find anything concrete about the pay in any kind of official or advertised manner . so at the very least the pay is not used to attract the fighters , yet i also haven't found anything saying that substantial pay is offered even after arrival . i asked my acquaintance how much if any is he getting paid for being there , and he said fuck-all , and after further inquiring said around $ 300/mo when converted . so at least in his case the "" substantially in excess of promised pay to other armed forces combatants "" criteria wouldn't hold . ( e ) some say that to be a member of the armed forces all you need to do is to join the structure of the armed forces in an official manner and be subordinate to their command , which foreigners do . but they haven't been trained by the armed forces and bring their own training . i haven't found anything regarding is this is considered a point of distinction or not . so i hate to be that guy who screams *** source *** with foam coming out of his mouth , but i would like to prove foreign fighters are indeed mercenaries as stated by the definition but i lack evidence . so anyone knows some sources i couldn't find ?"

3279,"r/worldnews just found new love in yahoo news , cause they are willing to put up any pos headline up for clicks the most recent : [ were losing but moscow will never admit it , russian soldier says ]( ""* it is believed that an audio recording that was given by ukraine's security service captures an intercepted phone call that took place between a soldier stationed in the kharkiv region and a female relative living outside of moscow . it was not immediately apparent when the discussion took place ; however , the anonymous man's comments seem to reflect those that have been heard often from russian troops throughout the majority of the conflict , which has lasted for almost five months .*"" * '* it is believed that '* \- one strike * '* audio recording that was given by ukraine's security service ' - two strikes * * '* intercepted phone call ' - three strikes * * *' a soldier stationed in the kharkiv regio*n ' - four strikes * bonus round : '* seem to reflect those that have been heard often *' this has less ground than highschool gossip , but it made to top spot in r/worldnews"
3280,"ukrainian minister of defense basically admitted that ukraine has lost at least 100,000 dead troops and possibly more . daaaaaaaaaamn zelensky will sacrifice every able bodied ukranian to preserve his rule"
3281,"after watching the recent footage of the alleged russian soldiers killing the two unarmed civilians it got me thinking . if those soldiers are found to be dpr , would russia have the power to court martial them ? technically the dpr forces are not russian , but i know russia has been commanding the dpr troops . if russia can't legally sentence dpr troops , then how do militias such as this go about prosecuting soldiers who commit war crimes ? i'm a bit confused about the legal process of it all ."
3282,"why didn't russia destroy critical infrastructures in the early days of the conflict ? ports , weapons factories , railway stations , power grid , etc ."
3283,"the german/dutch pzh 2000s should arrive in a couple weeks . imo , it's at least in theory , the perfect weapons system for the current combat we're seeing . they outrange any artillery on the battlefield right now , while simultaneously having the high mobility to keep the distance it needs as necessary . further , it has sufficient armour for a direct hit to be necessary with something of a decent caliber to properly disable them - difficult to achieve with an aerial attack if some anti-air is there to assist . and of course , a high fire rate and high precision to create significant damage before it retreats . only 13 units are being delivered so the impact can't be massive , but i still think that it could be interesting to see how ukraine ends up using them ."
3284,ukrainian society in disarray .
3285,how do you think this war will pan out during winter ?
3286,has zelensky captured moscow yet ?
3287,"to me this war is a disastrous consequence of obsession with history and national identity . we're seeing a violent culmination of ukrainian denial of history and whitewashing nazi criminals and toleration of large violent nazi groups and russian romanticisation of imperialism and association with psychotics like dugin and policy of threats of "" rebuilding "" pre-1917 russian empire . from ukrainian side , we see consequences in russia getting into confirmation bias spiral about nazi ukraine . from russian side , we see consequences countries formerly occupied by russian empire being chief supporters of ukraine and counting on russian army getting bled dry and unable to try to capture the territories occupied by russian empire ( that is poland and baltic countries ). was being normal and not larping bandera , nicholas i or whatever other nutcase so difficult ? also , lol at people who misread us withdrawal from afghanistan and iraq as a sign of weakness and a good omen for russian expansion . like they were withdrawing specifically to focus on deterring russia and china and to focus training and equipment procurement on conventional warfare . it was immediately obvious to me ."
3288,"i don't understand why western onlooker can't look at this war without their rose tinted glasses . this is not the 19th century anymore , there are undeniable facts out there . like , everyone could agree that the russia's initial plan to quickly capture kiev failed miserably . their attempts on kiev and on the north led to lots of human power and resources without much to show for ( other than destruction to the local population of course ). then the sinking of their flagship was a huge disaster . the loss of all of their generals too . but for ukraine , why it is so hard to admit that they fked it up big time here : 1 . knowing the power of russian force now , then the fall of kherson , melitopol were a disaster . they could have blown up the crimea bridge and limit all russian operation in the south . or blowing up the bridge leading to kherson and could protect everything west of the dniper . 2 . related to 1st point , losing berdiansk and volnovakha , leading to the encircling of mariupol and the loss of more than 5000 experienced troops ( 3500 prisoners ) were a disaster . how can anyone think the surrendering of a whole army is a success ? like if the russians veteran fighters were surrounded and surrendered in the thousands , we would have all laughed at how much of a bunch of losers they are . 3 . defending mariupol was a success in buying time , was it ? for what ? mariupol is literally the russian most important target in the entire ukraine ( just behind kiev and odessa ). russia will never be able to take kiev or odessa , even if they thrown all the men in mariupol there . even kharkiv is not as important strategically as mariupol . the event unfolded after mariupol showed that the bought time mariupol provided didn't help ukraine much as we now knows this war will continue to be grinded for years 4 . trying to defend every single untenable position , while admirable , was frankly stupid . why ppl think guarding an entrenched position while russian just pounded your positions using artillery is considered as ' bleeding the russians '? russian current strategy is literally sending out a scouting party , probing for where ukraine is firing from , then pound that position days and night will artillery shells till the ukraine can't tend their positions anymore and either get overrun or retreat . the russians are literally trading time and resources to reduce their own casualties , something the american war is all about . so what is with these ' professional , tactical retrograde ' and ' holding on positions to bleed the russian ' bs . the ukraine should have withdrawn from sievierodonetsk , cut off the bridge , and defend / retake popasna to secure their flank . now they are losing their nature defend of the siversky river ( which is what holding the russians back all this time ), lost their flank and all of the men guarding there ( zolete , popasna , etc ) and lysychansk and all defenders gonna get surrounded . 5 . playing down losing sievierodonetsk and soon lysychansk as some unnamed towns , are also dumb as fk . as mentioned , they had the siversky river ran through them , which is a proven natural barrier to defend against the russian . and both of them are also in top 50 largest cities in ukraine . that is like calling tampas , oakland , or minami as ' some nameless towns ' there was a saying , about how the fascist will always lose in war . cause they can't handle reality , underestimate the opponent while big up their own achievement . the russians were guilty of that during their 1st phase of the war , and get their arses kicked badly . but now it's the ukraine and the west turn . if they keep smoking their own propaganda , and think ' the russian is bleeding out and won't be able to continue soon ', then they gonna lose this big time if their prediction is incorrect"
3289,man gotta love all the propaganda happening around this . so little space for anyone who admits i dont fucking know who is winning i am not a trained military tactician but every redditor in r/worldnews has to spew their form of slava ukraine like good little trained monkeys even if it means supporting literal nazis . now i dont exactly like putin either he is a former kgb agent connected to more suspicious shit than teflon don but i dont have to back a corrupt government in ukraine either .
3290,"heads up to the mods , a bunch of world news people posting in the main thread are coming here to explicitly brigade and troll in hopes of taking over the sub . unfortunately they are so fragile they can even allow one place for content that isnt explicitly pro-ukranian"
3291,"between u/galaxyphotographer and u/sandbaggerslow , this sub is turning into r/ukraine 2.0"
3292,"now it is clear that the ukrainian defence line is collapsing much faster than ukrainian mod expected , considering that they don't even know whether their city has fallen and are depending on the russian to report it on the ground bolihivka was also abandoned despite the ukrainian should have hold a defence position there to hold off russian advance and to buy time for siversk ( whom was not in frontline previously and the defence there must not yet fully dugged in ) now the russian will have to make a decision , to either chase after the routed ukrainian force ( at the risk of being ambushed and their supply line and support artillery can't catch up ), or take their slow and steady approach forward ( risk giving ukraine time to rally their troops and build up their defence line )"
3293,"himars is the new m777 , which used to be the new bayraktar . basically the invincible piece of western weapons that gonna destroy all russians and solve all ukraine issues on the battlefield but the truth is , just like how couple of uavs , or couple of artillery pieces not gonna change the lopsided situation ukraine find themselves in . if couple of mlrs alone could eliminate every single ammo depot , and tanks , and soldiers barracks . ukraine would have been fighting in donbass with stones right now , considering how much mlrs system the russian have . but just like against bayrakta , or the m777 , the russian will adapt to any inconvenient setback the himars could cause . and then we will start searching for a new god that could solve all ukrainian battlefield issues once again"
3294,can someone help me better understand some reasons to support russia . i am neutral right now in this conflict and want to know the reasons i should support the russian side obviously weve all had enough reasons shouted at us why we should support ukraine so let me hear the other side . i am open to all discussions and wont get mad at any response i really just want to learn
3295,"there are rumours that russians are making new divisions/corps in nizhny novgorod , does anyone have some more info ?"
3296,looks like the kherson counter offensive started
3297,"the ukrainian better throw all their forces in to hold onto seversk cause seversk is a decent size town ( one third the size of lysychansk ). and have a railway line that connect luhansk with lyman , izumi and balaklii . would be a massive logistic victory for the russia , because lots of their material to attack sloviansk , kramatorsk and eventually southern part of kharkiv would go through this rail line"
3298,serious question to russians : do you think it's ok to get punished to call this conflict a war ? as far as i know it's a criminal offense in russia now - which can get you jailtime . sounds pretty crazy to me .
3299,"so now ukraine is about to have like 16 or 20 or 21 himars system . remember how they supposed to destroy everything with just 4 himars systems ? now they gonna destroy 5 times of everything along with their 1 millions men army , i am sure they gonna take back kherson and crimea and push toward moscow now"
3300,"if anyone has doubt that striking a bridge with himars or any of the mrls were a waste of rockets , just check out how they repair bridges ( reported in kherson , not sure which bridge there , but same idea ) [ [ and just in case you think that this is a sloppy way to fix the bridge , here is proper civil engineering manual on same issues"
3301,"urgently apu leaves seversk sources report that the equipment and manpower of the armed forces of ukraine are leaving seversk , moving through zvanovka in the direction of solidar ."
3302,"the biggest issue i have with this war , besides the war crimes that get committed(primarily by one side ) is the reasoning that given by pro russians on this war . 1 . russia wanted ukraine to be a border ground between them and nato . this is a complete fantasy for 2 main reasons , in 2014 russia invaded ukraine after a popular uprising from the people towards a president who didn't want to enter the european union , something that was wanted by a majority of ukrainians , with that invasion this pushed ukraine to be distrustful and hateful of russia , pushing them towards nato . so no there's no nato aggression , not like in the cold war . in short , you can't get mad that the person you punched ends up not liking you and wanting to be in a group with your enemy's 2 . russia feeling threatened . this one is the only one that actually has merit mostly because nato is a threat to current russia . not because nato is going to invade russia but because nato wants to curb russian expansion so they are in the way of russia having a larger sphere of influence . mind you nato is not planning to invade russia any time soon , at least in a first strike sense . nato has always been a more defensive alliance rather then offensive one . just look at the response to the iraq war and afghanistan sepretly , one was more condoned because one was for aggression and the other mostly a defensive reaction . did ukraine drop bombs into russia before the war began ?? did georgia commit terrorist attacks against russia before its invasion ?? its a flat out no to both questions . and just like america's invasion of iraq , russia's invasion of ukraine is unjustified and has no moral standing and should have never happened . 3 . war crimes done by ukraine . i am not gonna sit here and say that ukraine is innocent in the war of donbass before this current conflict . but i am not going to blow it out of proportions . there is no genocide of russians being committed , there never was , especially when half of the country itself is either russian or a mix of russian and ukrainian . just to give you an idea of what the ukrainians where doing prior to war , i'd say in some ways very similar to ireland in its attempt to reclaim its original language . they were never outlawing russian all they were doing was encouraging the return of ukrainian alongside russian , so that the history and language of ukraine wouldn't be lost to time . so no there is little to no evidence for a genocide , or even the implementations of one . so this reason is a mute point . 4 . denazification . this ones been thrown a lot , especially with the azov battalion , the azov battalion are neo nazis . that is a fact . but russia itself has an actual disturbing amount of neo nazis as well , and in russia it is way more prevalent then ukraine . the same goes for the us . the us and russia have more of a nazi problem then ukraine had at the start of the war . the far right party in ukraine which is supported by azov got only 2 percent in the last election . while both russia and the us have at least 5-10 percent of their population depicting nationalistic nazi tendency's . many genuine far right / nazi political leaders where actually kicked out of office by both porchenko(honestly i forgot how to spell his name ) and zelensky . many were fired or voted out of office in the last 5 years . ironically zelenskys party in ukraine is a center left liberal party who won over 70 % of the vote . so no this wasn't even for denazification . 5 . its the us's fault all a long(no it wasn't .) i propose a scenario for you one that will portray the situation but in the na region . if mexico were too try and join the csto . the us would feel threatened by that , having a russian ally on their doorstep would scare many americans and the us itself . however the us would never do a pre emtive invasion of mexico . for 2 simple reasons . one , the us has to much economic infrastructure to risk a war with mexico , and two . because unlike russia the us is not a one party far right reactionary dictatorship . so there would never be a consensus on the issue , if the democrat's were in power during this situation the dems wouldn't do anything . if the republican's where in power they also wouldn't do anything , not because they don't want to but because they can't , it would be political suicide , would cause a recession and would likely mean the other party taking over , the us would loose massive amounts of credibility within its own country and around the world . many allies of the us would probably leave them in that situation and it would put the us in a worse position . and even then after all this the us still invades . the us has no justification for it , because the mexican people choose to join the csto . the same way the ukrainian , finish , and swedish now wish to be in nato , and should be allowed to because its their wish and after a subsequent invasion of a neighbor of russia's ( in the case of finland and sweden ) and for ukraine , well getting invaded is a good fucking reason to join a defensive alliance . so my conclusion is . if you are pro russia that is fine , i disagree with you on every level on this conflict but that's your choice . however do not go spoutting lies and propaganda about why putin started this war . we already know why . putin wants to improve russia's world standing . he wants to have control over ukraine and belarus , weather as a genuine ally , puppet , or directly . he himself said . ' ukraine is not a sovereign country ' its ok to support either side , but do not lie to your self that putin was only trying to protect from scary nato . he invaded a sovereign country because they were trying to befriend a foreign enemy . ( epilogue ) so when you say why doesn't ukraine beg for peace , or why doesn't the us and the west stop supplying ukraine with weapons . remember to tell yourself that it wouldn't bring a white peace for both sides to enjoy , its your pro russia side getting a victory . so do not blame the west for supplying ukraine , the same way the us couldn't blame russia for supplying the taliban in afghanistan . you can get mad that they are but do not whine that its warmongering , because if the situation was reverse you would be saying the same thing to me about russia supplying ( insert us enemy here ) because its geo politics . don't cry when the person you punched punches ' back . and don't except them to grovel when they are holding their own against you even if its with some support ."
3303,"ok , lisichansk did fall much much faster than i expected fighting did happen though , so not like the russian was just rolling it . but the defense was collapsing super fast . did the defenders surrender ? or there were just a few units staying back as token units ? we won't know till further information , i guess note : ukraine always announce falling of their own city beforehand , so they can drive the narrative . not this time though , so maybe they were a bit surprised by how quick it is either way , the russian would be delighted that they were crossing the river and taking an ukrainian stronghold without much casualties . no major river gonna be on their way till the dniper now too edit : ok , the ukrainian mod was announcing that the city was not fully surrounded and still in ukraine hand earlier today . so unless he was lying then , otherwise the defenders of lisichansk must have surrendered"

3357,"well said indeed . ive always held that the current us admin has to foot a great deal of the blame for this conflict and todays war is partly the result of almost a decade of terrible western foreign policy . i dont know why biden is so dedicated to ousting putin , and sacrificing the people and lands of ukraine in the process when instead he could have continued trumps policy of just flattering the guy and waiting for him to either retire or just die . maybe its embarrassment for letting this start when he was vp , maybe its because of his sons blatant corruption but either way the way the us is currently going is the worst possible one . regardless i hope that if one good thing comes out of this whole debacle its that the west massively reconsiders how it conducts foreign policy and the seriously human impact of poor decision making in that regard ."
3358,"for real . they did some real good clearing out of buildings and rubble . how much do they make ? 250,000 dollars tax free for a year of conflict or the duration of conflict if its shorter is the going rate ?"
3359,"true . are there no regular russian troops fighting in donbas these days ? all we see is militia , chechens and wagner"
3360,its beneficial if all views are allowed . we discuss and argue with one another . we should try hard to keep it this way .
3361,that's an understatement
3362,"russian defy what the west , or us in specific , classified as ' liberal world order '. remember that german and france ( and in some reports uk too ) back in 2008 were against ukraine joining nato , and was shocked when the us tried to push that through . sweden and finland neutrality stance also protected their sovereignty through even the height of the cold war . all of them eventually fall in line russia and china ( and recently brazil and india ) however do not fall in line , and that was not acceptable it was not like nato ( or russia ) are a good bunch , or being principle on peace , democracy , or sovereignty alike . nato countries were also overthrowing sovereign regime using local separatists/rebels ( yugoslavia , afghanistan , iraq , libya , syria , ) and supported the sovereign regime against local rebels ( latin america , yemen , ukraine ). russian were were also doing exactly that , but slowly they found themselves to be on the opposite sides so the problem is not so much on defending ukraine , but to prevent russia ( and future actors , like china , india , etc ) from creating an alternative world order to current one . they don't want that the next time they invade iran , or north korea , or kazakhstan , or cuba , or venezuela they will have to face against russia , or china , or india propping up these government . or their propped up governments are overthrown by russian / chinese / indian backed rebels"
3363,"i think a lot of it is the military industrial complex , they made a lot of money in afghanistan . when biden pulled out they lost their cash cow . now they've found a new one ."
3364,dont be intentionally ignorant . they arent only doing it out of the kindness of their heart . theyre doing it because they have a risk free way to directly attack an enemy of their state without losing us lives . its win-win for them . they get to clear out old military stockpiles while using it exactly on what it was designed to be used on .
3365,"it's a competition of who can spend the most money on ukraine . the more you helped the more your opinion will matter as a country . this is why billions upon billions of dollars can just be created out of thin air , despite domestic problems that are arguably more important than some random country in eastern europe . a country also can not care for anything , rather , the governments are trying to outdo each other in the russia-bashing and eating up ukranian victimization propoganda . i see ukranian flags every day now , people wear flags on their backpacks and phones , even though most people didn't even know ukraine existed a year ago . crazy shit ."
3366,because thats how the defense contractors make money . paint someone as evil . manufacture conflict . control the narrative . pose as the good guys . buy tons of weapons . profit . profit . profit .
3367,"russia will keep making the lives of their neighbors miserable until someone puts them down , and the most convenient ally willing to put down russians happens to be ukraine . nato is crippling the russian military , economy , and hegemony without losing a single nato troop - why wouldn't they do it ?"
3368,"you can ask 10 people and get 10 different answers . the way i see it is there is only one question though ... who do you want essentially controlling the world . the us/nato or rf/ccp . agin speaking for myself the answer if as clear as a slap in the face .. and there's no fucking way i would want the rf or the ccp anywhere near me , my loved ones or my country . side note : > if i just consider the western narrative about ukraine being a victim of russian aggression , that's not ' a narrative ' at all ... russia invaded and invaded in force , possibly egged on by the west's inaction after crimea , the donbas and mh177 . but its still a full-on invasion , and in typical russian style a barbaric one ."
3369,"i see hunter biden or biden family getting a new board position on some "" humanitarian "" company or contractor operating in ukraine . a lot of that money will stay in the us with lockheed martin and halliburton . some will go to perhaps supporting ukrainian economy with lion's share going to kolomoiski and such and crumbs falling on the masses . they put no oversight clause of any kind and ukraine is the most corrupt country in europe , only rivaled by russia and moldova ."
3370,"the new measure includes $ 6 billion to arm and train ukrainian forces , $ 8.7 billion to restore american stores of weapons shipped to ukraine and $ 3.9 billion for u.s . forces deployed to the area . there's also $ 8.8 billion in economic support for ukraine , $ 4 billion to help ukraine and allies finance arms and equipment purchases and $ 900 million for housing , education and other help for ukrainian refugees in the u.s ."
3371,i think you underestimate us and ukraine corruption . that money already disappeared and they are already looking to spend more . for good measure they'll send expired ammo and weapons needing advertisement . ukrainian soldiers received a notice a few days ago saying they are forbidden to criticise western weapons on video or publicly .
3372,the pockets of the corrupt politicians in ukraine and oligarchs in the us
3373,not just casualties . russia seems to have taken a lot of pows the last month or so .
3374,nobody really knows . i think the my have lost more than russia though
3375,"if they kill the government : * it will be replaced by another us puppet government * they'll lose lot of spies and spy work * it could create chaos and a reason for poland/usa to invade west ukraine ( just like usa did to south korea ) * they look like the bad guys * government are civilians , so war crime too * it means killing government is fair game ( and putin doesn't want to be a target ) so only problems , no real advantage because government is mostly useless . sbu and military command was targeted though ."
3376,"the verkhovna rada is not a military facility . russia is conducting a "" special military operation "", not a full-fledged war , so the attacks are only aimed at military targets or dual-use infrastructure ( fuel depots , some plants , some bridges etc )"
3377,"the russian government and top brass is very dumb . i've had months to contemplate this , thats the only viable reason ."
3378,"just block him if you don't like his posts . he'll disappear . you can also filter to see only "" ru pov "" posts ."
3379,"it is clear that the russians are not at war with ukraine . only with the puppet nazi regime of zelensky ( kolomoisky , akhmetov , etc .), controlled by the united states . therefore , i do not understand why russians are not understood in the west . we just want the real sovereignty that we had before 1991 ! i do not understand the inhabitants of europe who are now destroying their normal lives for the sake of the united states . i do not understand why no one pays attention to the fact that nato is a puppet of the united states . are there really people who do not know how nato bombed belgrade , how nato killed iraqis , syrians , libyans and many other peoples for the sake of us interests ? i do not understand how there can be people in modern europe who do not understand the laws of modern economics ? don't you understand how the dollar works after the brettenwoods agreements ? for 80 years the united states ate at someone else's expense , the russians experienced it for themselves in the 90s . our country has been plundered and almost destroyed by corrupt politicians and the cia . i remember very well how in my country ( the strongest and richest in the world ) there was nothing to eat . everything was taken out to the west ! now your question is where are we going ? to sovereignty ! which , as it turned out , no one in the world ( except russia ) has as long as the united states and its system of reserve currencies led by the dollar exist !"
3380,"maybe wait for politicians like le pen , salvini etc . to gain power and then restore relations ."
3381,"the best question . do you think there are many people in ukraine now thinking "" why the hell did we not comply with the minsk peace agreements ""? ukraine had 8 years for this . zelensky was chosen just because he swore to actually do it . ukraine could simply comply with these peace agreements , and the dpr and lpr would be part of it , just with more expanded provos . this war would not have happened ."
3382,"if zelensky do these , he will find himself in a car bomb ' accident ' the ukraine banked so much on becoming a nato and eu member , that if they have to wake up from that dream ( and yes it is a dream ), there will be a lot of anger that need to channel onto someone . the russian may take ukraine's neutrality stance of nato/eu and the donbass + kherson autonomy though . they do need donbass to satisfy their allied promise , but they also will need kherson now to ensure the supply of water to crimea . and without nato backing , if kiev do any of the funny business ( invite nato over to train their troops , assembling an army within nato standard ), russia can simply declare ukraine on violating the deal and then resume the fight , this time more prepared to deal with current ukraine tactic not to mention , without nato backing , kiev has no resource to rebuild their military to become a russian threat . their economy right now is horrible , and their infrastructure ravaged . it will be difficult for idf to flow into the country for foreseeable future too"
3383,it's as if constantly fighting doesn't solve any problems . don't know what the endgame is for the west . it's either escalation or capitulation .
3384,johnson was thrown out because of domestic reasons not necessarily to do with the economy . he was a corrupt liar ; and a public one at that . conservatives started losing votes and they kicked him out . simple as that . support for ukraine the uk is huge .
3385,that's .... how democracies work ? has it really been so bad in russia that folks don't realize western leaders step down when the people demand it ?
3386,"i agree with most of your point exempt on bucha , there is photographic and satalite evidence that russian forces were still in bucha , and that the bodies there had been there for weeks . so its not a false flag . especially with independent resources also agreeing that the massacre was real , mainly middle east and indian media for example ."
3387,"i really must ask ... what is a nazi ? it seems like everyone throws around this term all willy-nilly and it has lost all meaning . like the word "" racist "". like in western media : "" racist nazi "" = a white guy who doesn't like his home being flooded with non-white people "" brave hero fighting oppression "" = a non-white guy who doesn't like his home being flooded with people not his own race both these words : nazi , racist ... have pretty much lost all meaning in the last 20 years due to overuse towards people who are not those things ."
3388,"i think the fact is that besides azov there are many more neo-nazi groups aidar , dnestr , dnipro , right sector , kraken and others . also , some members of the government were previously associated with these units . and during the war , these groups have a lot of influence . zelensky is afraid of angering them ."
3389,"well since when can we rely on whatever the media calls someone to gain attention ? from my perspective it is rational to keep azov and not disbanding it . they do their purpose extremely well of defending their country and i mean if they die , who cares they are nazis . it is also not the smartest idea to try to disband like the most famous unit of your country while in a war + you know that this unit will revolt against you when disband it . and like them or not , but they are doing a great job right now , being the last stand against a superpower under the worst possible conditions . i really hope they make it out alive though , because whatever will await them in russian captivity is hell on earth "
3390,imagine having to choose between 2 senile idiots who are basically the same lol
3391,"so you're saying that ... you would vote for the guy who tried to end american democracy as we know it because biden is giving too much support to ukraine ... and that you dislike how wn is super pro-ukraine , so you now do support the killing of innocent civilians because you are so mad at the pro-ukrainians on reddit ? interesting take , ivan ."
3392,"honestly , i don't think biden even has any mental capacity to do anything right now i am left leaning too . and supporting trump is idiotic as fk . but like honestly . ask yourself this . if biden tomorrow tells us that he gonna fire nuke onto north korea . do any of us believe that his decision is correct ? or we all wonder if he ' misspoke ' again ? his speech outside of teleprompter doesn't even make sense now , just recycling words salad . biden . and dianne feinstein too . like honestly it is elder abusing at this point to even keep them in office . frankly those two are corrupted as fk , so i don't want them to retire peacefully . but it would be the best thing for america right now"
3393,> i honestly feel like an idiot . thats the only part of your post that makes any sense .
3394,"i definitely hate the democrats , but i definitely think biden is doing the right thing in arming ukraine . hell , give them f-22s for all i care"
3395,this is some fucking brain rot . i hope to hell you're getting paid to spout this drivel .
3396,ukraine is trying to keep them hidden from the public so that morale will not collapse . which it might if they knew the true numbers . almost certainly significantly higher than russias .
3397,"the official data makes no sense . everyone overestimates the losses to each other . you can only rely on the data of military reporters regarding the battalion in which they serve , or on the data of official international organizations when they come out"
3398,"no one want to disclose ukrainian casualties . ukraine for obvious reasons . and russia because they don't want ukrainians to see them as butchers . russia is more keen at disclosing surrenders . they still disclose ukrainian casualties from time to time ( they said today 5 ukrainians air assault soldiers surrendered as 30 of their colleagues died in donbass ), but there is no video or material so i don't post it ."
3399,considering that i've seen around 15 videos of ukrainian battalions saying they have lost 80 % of it their battalion and pleading for zelensky to save them i reckon they are suffering significant loses
3400,"first , it's a court who decides if someone is a mercenary . and any court is biased , 2 judges can rule different judgement . justice is much less logical and deterministic than programmers think . second , in the geneva convention ( that dpr didn't sign ) it's also stated that it's a local system/court that decide if pow status could apply , it's stated that if they doubt then it applies . if they don't doubt it doesn't apply . more specifically : * a ) recruited and volunteered is the same . this condition is checked if you where given a new position for this conflict . opposed to contract soldiers or contract security that are on payroll before the conflict . * c ) this is completely up to the court's interpretation . first salaries are probably hidden for the purpose of dodging being called a mercenary . and * private gain * does not refer to only direct salary , but also fame or indirect money ( sponsors , plan to give conferences later , write a book , etc ...). so the judges could decide whatever they want here . * e ) any court examines conditions for crime characterisation and immunity ** at the time the crime is committed ** ( or planned the crime if planning the crime is also a crime ). not at the time of arrest , and not at the time you gain immunity . at the time these soldiers planned to become mercenaries in ukraine , planned to train and fight , they where not yet in uaf . so they committed the crime of "" planning to commit act aimed at seizing power by force "" before they could have immunity ."
3401,the allies of ww2 said the waffen ss were not volunteer soldiers and executed or imprisoned them . basically the ukraine volunteers are doing the same thing the waffen did minus the genocide of course
3402,"probably go to shit even more than it is now because the whole country is more corrupt than the catholic church and theyve stopped being useful to the west as a proxy state . any funds sent to ukraine would be pilfered by zelensky , the oligarchs , then whatever is left would be stolen by bureaucrats . if accepted into the eu , you would see a mass exodus of skilled and educated ukrainians to the west , leaving behind a rotting husk . ukraine simply does not have the institutions and legal system to foster long term growth so long as the current political establishment remains in power . this has been a problem since it became independent of the soviet union and did not get any better under zelensky . he failed to deliver on his promises reforms on corruption and the economy , fired a prosecutor general who was cleaning up the scenes , rode roughshod over ukraines supreme court , imprisoned political enemies who he claimed were in bed with russia , and forced the resignation of the head of the central bank . read this for some numbers on the state of the economy right before the war . handing over us taxpayer dollars in some kind of marshall plan to help rebuild their economy while under such shoddy management would be a serious misallocation of resources . but of course , we send it to them anyway ."
3403,"still very bad short term cause they lost all of their exporting means and their infrastructure is in tatter . will take months to demine all of odessa for example , their only remained port . and lots of bridge and dams , some which the ukraine destroyed themselves , will need to be rebuilt then the conflict could reignite any moments , means few foreigner will want to invest into the countries people houses also got destroyed . ukraine also lost like 10 % of their population who left their country . even if they come back , they may return to an abandoned / destroyed house while their old job/business no longer active . then high fuel price , and the loss of their nuclear power plant ( which electricity will be taken and convert to russia in september ) means fuel and energy shortage will be wide spread . while the eu is in dire economical situation and in energy shortage themselves and won't be able to assist much"
3404,"reddit is fucking nauseating about this russia war . it was the same glee during afghanistan invasion , iraq , libya , syria etc don't forget that the director of reddit content is ex-nato . she left nato to join reddit and is in charge of content"
3405,"that subreddit is full of stupid kids , can one really expect better ?"
3406,you have a link ?
3407,my source is that i made it the fuck up 
3408,"ukranians , not troops . as in murdered civilians"
3409,good question i hope they get court martialed
3410,"the dpr , if autonomous should prosecute them according to their laws . although honestly i bet ru would be a worse punishment so hoping thats what happens ."
3411,i wouldnt hold my breath waiting for them to face punishment by russia .
3412,"because exemples you gave are not worth destroying . ports are blockaded , why destroy them . weapons factories make no difference since weapons can be imported . it's more cost effective to destroy actual weapon stockpiles . railway stations are useful if you take the place , hard to destroy , cheap and fast to rebuild . same for power grid ."
3413,as for powergrid ; did you miss them b-lining for chernobyl and zaporozhia ?
3414,because i dont think russia is going for all out annihilating ukraine but rather expanding the two breakaway republics . in that case destroying key infrastructure like ports and factories wouldnt really be beneficial to their overarching goal .
3415,"simple quick answer would be they tried and failed . objectively russia failed in taking out enough of ukraine's infrastructure to eradicate it , at best russia took out 40-60 % at worst they took out 15-30 %. its just objective truth , its kinda like if the us bungled the air campaign in iraq . that's the situation russia put itself under"
3416,"because upper russian command was stupid , they should've targeted all ukranian vital infrastructure , rail lines , political buildings , powerplants and etc . russia wanted to pull a gulf war moment in ukraine , and to do that you have to hit super duper hard and super duper fast . if they wanted a swift victory , they should've gone for the head , missile strikes on the ukranian rada , presidential palace etc , army command posts , political leadership . this is what they should've done . you reap what you sow . this conflict could've ended eons ago if the russian generals weren't so stupid ."
3417,"the war will look a lot like it does right now - slow russian advances . the major questions are all around troop strength , and if ukraine can train and field a competent fighting force to launch a counter-offensive . the most interesting questions are around western support for the war if gas/energy prices spike due a cold autumn or winter . united states support * should * remain strong , but i am not convinced that western europe will tolerate damaging their economies for 1-2 years to save eastern ukraine ."
3418,last reports suggest that he will be crossing the garden ring and assaulting the red square by noon tomorrow .
3419,"i don't think it's about nazi or anything like that , look at how putin already has switched reason fort he war 3 times and the objective each months . they would make any justification needed , but this one is great for making the talkies happy putin is hellbent on restoring russian might against europe , loosing every old soviet republic one by one has imo made the kreml see that russia can't be the eastern leader in its current corrupt state with peaceful means and the kazakh and white russian popular protests galvanised them in a now or never state . i'm very sure that we would have a sub about bellarussian or kazakh war if they would have tried to break free before the start of this war ."
3420,"your assumption that ukraine is trying to win is false . zelensky knows he won't , biden too . the goal is to delay losing . and to achieve this goal , ukrainians must believe they can win . and the whole west too . there are more benefit to stay at war for usa's governing elites than having peace . even if it means ukraine will lose more down the road ."
3421,"> i am not a trained military tactician even if they are , they dont have the info so its pure speculation anyway ."
3422,"complains about ridicolous ukriane propaganda , next sentence literal nazis ... like comon its the biggest russian propaganda point of all , not that theres no nazi or very rigth wing fascist-ish elements but there are quite a few on the russian side as well like the boss of wagner lol edit ; a bit off topic but here in sweden 2014-15 was a strange rollercoast for the local nazis and fascist gangs , first big support for ukriane something like 50 actual volunteers to far rigth groups , then the largest group nmr switched and allied with russian fr right-wing group receiving armed training and whatnot there , at a time there reportedly was volunteers on both side of the trenches all though in small number . now they somehow settled for that both ukriane and russia are "" pro-jew "" ans the war is not worth sacrificing nordic blood for . probably because the division got so bad back in 2015 that some smaller groups just died"
3423,"russia is less nazi than ukraine ? doesn't all eastern europe have a small nazi problem , especially russia ? even western europe and the usa has some small nazi problem . the trained monekys are the ones eating the ukraine is all nazis bs . do you know any ukrainians ? are they nazis ? read up on neo nazis in russia and the russian military . read about racism and homophobia and nationalism in russia . read the definition of fascism and then look at the russian government . you can do all this objectively"
3424,no one is supporting literal nazis you brain dead monkey
3425,ah so the great reddit offensive has begun .
3426,"you can post more pro-russian content . i personally like their submissions . difference with r/ukraine is not that we don't post pro-ukraine stuff . it's that : 1 . we ** also ** allow pro-russian stuff 2 . we don't circle jerk , harass or insult the other side this creates an environment where discussion is possible between the 2 sides ."
3427,if it wasn't for us there would be little to no ua pov that wasn't in a negative light . this is legit the first sub i've ever cross-posted anything to .
3428,"you are welcome to post any pro russian stuff to "" cancel "" us out . i post news from both sides , btw ."
3429,"just block them , that's what i did"
3430,"well , the fact that the ukrainian government post the azov battalion and their right sectors troops ( who is famous for their anti-russian-people stance ) right at the donbass frontline where lots of ethnic-russian ukrainian lives . that alone can answer your questions like , imaging if the us form known kkk members of their military into a battalion and send them out for combat missions in africa or middle east"
3431,> has ukraine really been shelling pro-russian separatist civilians there in the last 8 years ? there're un human rights office's reports . [
3432,as if it's not obvious that thanks to the shiny western toys the russians still haven't taken ukraine .
3433,"i follow the telegram channel of the russian ex-pilot . he recently made this post . tldr : s-300 and buks are op . i'm not sure how much of this is true . here is a machine translation with a couple of corrections : > as of today , the russian air force is confronted by : > > twenty divisions * s300pt/ps and one s-300v1 division . a little less than thirty buk-m1 air defense systems > ( i do not take into account any manpads , "" osas "" and other "" tunguskas "", they do not have a significant impact on the work of aviation ). > > a picture of the airspace is provided by 30 locators of all stripes and nato awacs from romania and poland + reconnaissance aircraft and uavs from the black sea . > > the aviation is represented by two and a half dozen su-27p/ubs and mig-29s , which take turns to be on duty outside the range of our sams and our fighters under the cover of their sams . > > there are about five su-25s and about 30 mi-8 and mi-24 helicopters . > and there are a little more than a dozen bayraktars . > > all of the su-24m/mr and the remnants of the c-125m1 appear to have been completely destroyed . > > almost all of the ukrainian airfields have been rebuilt and combat-ready . > and all available aviation is spread thinly over them . > > there are deliveries of combat aircraft , helicopters and hired pilots from abroad . > > it should be noted that ukraine uses everything that flies to provide reconnaissance , transportation . this includes an-2s , yak-52s , and other flying things . > and the ukrainians use about twenty signal simulators . > > let's go back to sams . > two dozen s-300s and three dozen buks is serious . this is about 40 % of what it was at the beginning of the war , but it's a lot . > ukrainians don't actually use sams to cover their targets , they use them to destroy our air force . i intentionally omit cruise missile work , that's another topic . there is a significant difference between covering objects and destroying aviation . you can catch them on the retreat , work from ambushes , and work with a short time to turn on the radiation locators . > it is possible to attempt to destroy all these sam systems within a couple of days using the existing resources , but after this tactical aviation will cease to exist . not much will remain of the army either . > > so now the hard work of detecting and destroying each of s-300 and each buk is under way . > how long this work will go , i do not know . > > with the remaining fighters and bayraktar-type bullshit , after the destruction of most of the sam , the issue will be resolved in a day or two . > > but there is still a long way to complete air supremacy . > > let me remind you that there are three kinds of air supremacy . > full , operational and tactical . > > \* the s-300 division of the ukrainians is stripped down . this is rpn[illumination and guidance radar ?] + kp[command post ?] + 1-2 pu[launcher ?]"
3434,my theory is their airforce is an integral part of defense and it's probably the thing they cant afford to lose or replace . it's essential to have that to prevent a possible nato invasion
3435,"probably because achieving air supremacy is actually really , really difficult . the main problem is that sead is highly risky and needs lots of training to pull off . the russian air force has long been plagued by limited flight time amongst its pilots . in which case its likely that those pilots spent most of their limited available flying time practicing basic air to air or basic air to ground and didnt dedicate the required time to such a specialized practice ."
3436,that's what i'm still baffled they havnt done yet .
3437,because anti air is impossible to get rid of . there is always a stinger or manpad somewhere . advanced aircraft are kept for later.the big war is probably later . which is also why russia only sent 1/10th of its army
3438,"russia is opposed to us imperialism , with everything that follows : us weapon lobby , arbitrary invasions , consumerism , plutocratism , "" progressism "", currency inflation , pollution , sanctions to disobedient countries . to me it's not so much that i'm pro-russia , it's that i'm anti-usa . usa is the world's biggest threat , especially to europe as it has destroyed us on all levels since 40 years . our only hope is that usa goes down fast . russia is contributing to that , not militarily , but economically the fight is monstruous . if russia/china continues to disconnect from dollar and take a few countries with them , usa biggest asset ( dollar ) will crash , and usa with it . then the world is free . this economic fight can only continues if russia/china are not destabilised through us proxies like ukraine , taiwan , hongkong . as a 2nd point i think zelensky is corrupt and not fighting for ukrainians , he's fighting for usa and ready to sacrifice his people for personal gains . he should surrender and accept all russian demands , ukrainians would benefit . people in donbass and kershon will be good in russia , and the other parts of ukraine will be good without weapons ."
3439,nato couped ukraine government in 2014 which caused crimea to declare independence and later join russia nato recklessly tried to get ukraine to join them ukraine killed 15k russians in the donbass region ukraine was one of 2 nations ( the other is the us ) to not condemn nazism in the un resolution zelensky seems like a puppet to me for how reckless he was acting against russia
3440,"if they do , they will not publicly announce it iran ( and china ) send observers to this war at the very least , as they would want to see first hand how nato weapons and trainings would work in open combat situation . and if there is any weakness that their own army needs to avoid / that they can exploit in the future . i am sure the nato also do the same"
3441,well they're kind of busy in syria and yemen already . probably afghanistan too .
3442,"not russian , but i assume it is not so much on using the term itself , but more on how much you willing to defy the state narrative . in general , i tends to think these shorts of news are overblown by the west . like really ? how are they going to monitor everyone in their house and in their workplace , to make sure that they won't utter a certain word ? they may use it as an excuse to arrest dissidents though"
3443,"without knowing more information , i'd guess that ukraine and the us are getting desparate ."
3444,i think they are just replacements for stuff that has been destroyed .
3445,"well , it's well known that to properly break bridges you need heavy air bombs ."
3446,"city is not defendable . it is in a low position surrounded by high grounds . for the same reason , russia doesn't take position inside the city , they are going around ."
3447,"i think you overlook several things in your analysis . which is usa and nato actions : * usa seeks world domination * usa destabilize other countries ( direct invasion , proxy war , funding revolutions ) * usa bully other countries that oppose him ( sanctions and whatnot ) * usa uses that to force them to rely on dollar and print money on their back ( thus making them pay in inflation ). * russia opposes that , thus is bullied since long into applying us values and rules * usa/nato broke its promises of not expanding and seek confrontation in funding opponents in russia and neighboring countries and encircling russia with military and missile bases that could defeat its nuclear deterence . * which led to ukrainian revolution in 2014 * usa used that to try to weaken russia strategically ( taking crimea through ukraine ). it didn't work . * usa then tried to put bases in ukraine , arm ukraine and trains it into a proxy , brainwash its population into anti-russia sentiment since putin's actions are a response to end this , of course if you overlook them then what putin has done makes no sense ."
3448,it's useless to stop if ukraine doesn't . ukraine will just rebuild its forces and the war will continues later . which is why a condition for russian to stop is ukraine to accept neutrality and demilitarisation . otherwise russia must continue to advance to keep its momentum
3449,"im a very pessimistic person but i think after they conquered donbass they need to take odessa so ukraine will be a land locked country this would heavily hurt ukrainian economy . the questions is when will the ukrainian site beginn to negotiate . because even if russia conquer the donbass or even other parts of the country it doesnt mean that ukraine will just stop fighting . i personally think that both sides cant fight for many years . ukraine would turn into a syria in europe(high emigration,braindrain,corrupt system and a economy hanging on western life support ) on the other site it would cost russia much money to keep going with fighting . i think russia doesnt have any equipment shortage they store so many soviet stuff in the country the only problem will be manpower lets see how they want to handle it . so in think odessa will be after donetsk the major city to capture for russia because after that moldova will be steam rolled . russia is fully sanctioned by europe and surprisingly the economy is working quite well ."
3450,"stopping at the donetsk oblast = allowing ukraine to prepare a counter-offensive safely , right ?"
3451,"obviously they will push toward the dniper river at very least , where they would have a natural barrier to hold off against any future attacking forces ( while still could strike the west bank through kherson or belarus ). or going all the way and taking over the entire ukraine any peace before it will just gonna be a stall for future conflicts . unless ukraine agree to demilitarize and stay neutral off nato . even so , russia will look at finland and sweden , and wonder if ukrainian promise to stay neutral can even be trusted"
3452,what will happen to the russian economy if it stops supplying gas to europe ? the answer is that won't happen . europe is a cash cow to russia . there is no other market that is that large and that needs russian gas
3453,"yes , short term is recession . but there are good points too . europe won't need to raise rates as much to lower inflation , which is counter intuitively good for the governments because due to debts and we , raising rates costs a lot . exports will increase because euro is devaluing . trade balance will become positive . so long term this is good , and cutting gas reliance is something that should have been done before . short term costs , long term gains . the danger is if we buy us gas , then it cancels every advantage and we get all the disadvantages for short term comfort ."
3454,"question : the europeans themselves are suffering from the sanctions they have imposed against russia . when will their national interests take over and they start negotiating with the kremlin ? answer : never . question : why is the west refusing to trade with russia , if there is no replacement for the russian resources ? answer : the elite of the west explains to its layman : russians are bad , you can't buy anything from them , but it's impossible to survive without their resources , which means that these resources must be taken away , especially since bad russians don't deserve them ; this is just a large-scale preparation of western public opinion for a third world war , including a nuclear one . that's what is going to happen with the european economy . it's going to become a war economy ."
3455,"is this the same "" zaporizhizhia avenger "" who has shot down 6 russian planes while wearing his iron man jammies ? ukraine's propaganda is so much more entertaining than russia's ."
3456,that's abit hypocritical considering the us has launched illegal wars all across the world for the benefit of it's corporations and left every nation in shambles after they leave
3457,they probably thought they could get away with the same things the west has for decades . putin obviously isnt as smart as we think he is
3458,"if 2014 didn't happen , then there won't be a war today . that is frankly the difference between a democratic nation , and ukraine . like the entire of us democratic party believed that trump rigged the elections , and similar number in republican believes that biden did something similar . however any attempts to alter the government through force ( january 6th ), does meet the condemnation from both sides even when us was at war , ww2 , korean war , vietnam war , afghanistan and iraq war . their democratic process still go on as normal . the standing government doesn't use external conflict to clamp down internal opposition meanwhile in ukraine right now , the current government already is cheering on the banning and confiscating assets of opposition parties . for treason charge ? so they believed a portion of their own citizens ( who vote for these officer ) are treasonous ? that alone makes the current ukraine government to be more similar to russia , than to any of their western allies ."
3459,"without the events in 2014 there would have been no war , and both the russian and ukrainian economy would be on a whole other level , they never would've dreamt about a war"
3460,"western funded ? no matter how much i search anything reliable , this just shows up as a conspiracy theory . i see why this channel has lost most people who wanted truth , just leave . nearly everything points to ukrainians trying to rebuild themselves away from their past . oh well , i probably should not comment , and just simply do what others did , but i think i still have an ounce of patience remaining to try and see the other point of view ."
3461,probably ukrainian conscripts would be sent by russians to die in poland or something .
3462,"in a world where there is no airforce , then it ' might ' be a valid question . but who know , maybe you think that himars can shoot down airplanes too but if it is possible to destroy all depots , headquarters , and other critical stuffs using long range artillery . then ukraine would be fighting the war with stones right now . so the question is fictional in the first place . like ukraine right now , the russian will just split their ammo depots into smaller one where it costs more for himars to attack and destroy than the cost to rebuild and fill up those depot"
3463,maybe they consider that goal accomplished since they caught those azov commanders in mariupol ?
3464,"the denazification was not about ukraine but denazification of the ukrainian armed forces/government . a few days(maybe a week ) into the invasion , putin went to an aviation school . i saw a video(with subtitles in english ) of him sitting at a table(not a long one ) with loads of young women . he talked about denazification again and admitted there are neo nazis in russia but said they are not part of the russian government . since russia can no longer topple the government , they can't do anything about it . edit : watch from 9:00 - as an aside , russia had(or still has ?) major neo nazi problem . does anyone remember how they would shoot videos of brutally beating people from places like dagestan ? i have seen documentaries about it - if i remember correctly , one was called - from russia with hate . there was a party/at least one duma member who was supportive of those neo nazis . maybe they have solved this problem . any russians care to comment ?"
3465,"it wasn't a real goal , it's blurry and meaningless . it could mean overthrow government , destroy nationalist groups , change anti-russian administration . i'm not sure they dropped it , every russian telegram is picturing every ukrainian loss as denazified . it's just a moral argument , ukrainians have the "" invader "" argument , russia has the "" nazi "" argument , and both mean nothing , it's just name calling ."
3466,"so what you are looking for ? a video of a shell flied off from ukrainian artillery , travelling through the air , hit a house , and kill a guy in it ? or this works too ?"

3472,"its just inversing other subs where pro russia posts get downvoted . you'll never find a sub where you get all your neutral needs so try find a couple of subs , like combatfootage , to balance what you see ."
3473,"do you treat ' ru pov ' as pro-russia ? this sub is one of the few places where you can actually see the russian side of the conflict which is , you know , rather important to have an informed opinion on things . why does everything have to be about the fucking propaganda wars ?"
3474,"while i do think that some russian concerns about the region are legitimate ( in particular i consider it in the long-term interest of everyone that crimea remains russian , even if disagree with how the transfer was effected ), putins statements that the war was absolutely necessary are in my view , purely fictional . the conflict was frozen ; in the entire year prior , by lpr/dpr statements , you had less than 40 civilian casualties , which thanks to the invasion you now see multiple on a daily basis if not more . i dont consider preemptive strikes to be legitimate in the first place ( mostly due to the slippery slope and easy excuse it provides ), but the evidence provided for the pretext in this case is very much unconvincing . from what i can see , putin is also heavily underplaying the willingness of eu countries in particular to diplomatically work on the concerns that russia had ; there were efforts by many eu members to a ) keep negotiation open with russia ( merkel , macron , and others ) but also efforts to pressure ukraine on problematic stances ( the eu had pressured the country to remove discriminatory language laws ( partially already successfully ), and also working on the removal of far-right elements from the ukrainian army , as conditions to further economic integration ). as a whole ; i believe putins decision to solve the issue with a large-scale invasion to be completely unacceptable . as a result i believe it to be important that he should not be allowed to achieve his objectives in the country , because that would set a very dangerous precedent of force being a more effective tool than diplomacy , setting future world stability into jeopardy ."
3475,"for me , it's the hypocrisy . how not a single soul gave a fuck about the west tearing up the middle east in the last 2 decades . or the us unconditional support of isreal while they are committing a modern day genocide against the palestinians . and when those journalists said those lines , that it's so sad because they have "" blue eyes , blonde hair "". watching the massive uproar of the world that was no where to be seen the last 2 decades . just one look trough history will show you exactly how this has happened before . look up the cuban missile crisis . no nation with a sane leader will let her enemies so close to her borders . and what pisses me off the most is the gullible mfs on the internet . some dumb mfs i swear . lots of small stuff added to it , like the racism the ukrainian border guards displayed towards african and indian students . refusing to let them board the trains and evacuate . ect....and the propaganda . my god don't get me started on that . anyways plus i love russian tanks and armored vehicles .

3485,spot on but europe(germany and france ) can stop this war . it's a proxy war for the us . european majors don't have to suffer . maybe they are just waiting for a few more months .
3486,nobody really knows the situation on the ground . russians could still take over large part of ukraine if they manage to take out ukrainian army in donbass .
3487,"1 ) ukrainians did it themselves 2 ) ukrainians parked military equipment near the building 3 ) ukrainians should just surrender and no one will be hurt anymore 4 ) "" where were you the last 8 years when ukrainians shelled donbass ?"" 5 ) the apartment block was abandoned , no cars can be seen near it 6 ) americans did worse in iraq this , but unironically , is what pro russian supporters feel about anything the pro ukrainian propaganda is trying to push on them . please , you're feeling kinda similar things when anyone asks you about ukrainian indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas in clear retaliation of the damage inflicted on them by russians ."
3488,"how do feel about ukraine indiscriminately killing civilians now in clear retaliation to the humiliate rout they suffered in lysychansk ? and have you stopped beating your wife yet , genuine question ? yeah , there was nothing genuine about your [ loaded question ]("
3489,"huh , i doubt that russians are capable to treat nkoreans worse than they're treated at home . if anything , making suchlike deals with russia can only liberalize nkorea . but apparently , you're not interested in making the lives of nkoreans better ."
3490,lmao at blinken calling out warcrimes . we truly live in clown world .
3491,why does russia need to justify the western fake news ?
3492,"looks at the map , and this is delusional talk . there are 4 roads leading into kherson , and the rest of the territories are mostly open field . so the 1millions men ukrainian army either could funnel hundreds of thousands of their army into couple of main roads where the russian could concentrate their fire on / mined / blocked . or their army could slowly advance through the open wheat field , while russian airforce and long range missiles leisurely bomb them away basically the ukrainians have to grind things down like the russians are doing in donbass , but firepower is against them"
3493,i highly doubt there's going to be one million soldiers willing and ready to reclaim all of the southern captured area .
3494,"well unfortunately that is the world that we are living in . the strong do what they can , and the weak do what they must just like the us who can decide which country rich in oil or natural resources that are infested with ' terrorists ' or ' communists ' that needs ' freedom ' and ' democracy '. russian is doing the same , but with ' nazi ' now . ukrainian however is stupid enough to have the entire battalion literally neo-nazi . so that cut out a lot of works for the russian"
3495,"> also the best solution to nazis is that putin flattens the cities there , kills the people and then annexes the land . that's what we did with nazi germany and nazi japan , right ? kinda proven to be a solution ."
3496,yes ukraine is responsible since you dont play stupid games when you have russia as a neighbour . should have stayed neutral instead of going after europe free gibs
3497,"alright , but i just cant feel sympathy for western ukrainians when they tried to commit a "" cultural genocide "" of the eastern russian-ukrainian populations , came in with them swastikas into russian speaking ( and historically russian ) cities and welcomed cia headquarters a few km outside of moscow . you can take this as you will . the nazis invading sudeterland is not even close to the worst thing the nazis ever did . and everyone else did this too throughout history . turks created a fake republic in cyprus like the dnr and lnr . the british have built northern ireland which is more or less the english version of the donetsk people's republic . kosovo being a country at all is an international law joke and it is still rightfully so not recognised by every country ., if we want to be fair . dont give me the nazis did this propaganda . everyone has done it throughout history . borders change constantly ."

3503,"of course theres talks about making peace , scholz/macron have both done several statements cautioning against escalation ."
3504,exactly . they don't give two shits about ukrainians . if they did they'd be on their knees begging putin for a peace deal . it seems the only way the us can win a war is have someone fight it for them .

3508,and get to test it's effectiveness against the enemy it was designed to fight .
3509,"how many people are suffering because of this outside of russia and ukraine ? even in wealthy countries , there are reports of problems due to increases of energy and other prices . so , this is not without cost for nato . in the third world people might starve and die ."

3511,"how does defending ukraine help make sure us/nato controls the world , not rf/ccp ? russia doesn't seem to want to control the world . they only seem to care about keeping a few neighbouring countries under their influence , and it doesn't seem the west would lose much by allowing that . china might want to control the world , and this war is probably helping that happen . it is hurting many nato countries via sanctions and high energy prices . they're spending lots of money on this . it may also be alienating other countries , like 3rd world countries which are negatively impacted ."

3513,"double or triple more than russia , but ukranian propaganda along with the west is built on not reporting it . they will only report losses when they are literally running out of infantry , then you'll know how bad it is . right now ukraine is having to rely on teens and 50 + year olds to join the war effort . so yeah , it's real real bad in terms of their losses ."

3543,"1/10th of the army seems incorrect . perhaps if you consider all troops active or in reserve , but even if you look at only active troops , gotta remember , not all troops are created equally . a significant portion of russian forces are conscripts , which are simply not an adequate replacement for professional soldiers and politically much harder to get to the frontline . not all troops are useful or deployable ; a large majority of russias naval forces are stuck outside of the combat zone and will stay there , for example . other troops are necessary to maintain within their current positions for strategic regions . also , russia has been actively trying to modernize its army for some time now , which in general means cutting back on numbers and focusing more on special operations troops . maybe 1/10th of the personnel is currently there , but id be surprised if they would have the capability to more than double the actual combat forces in the war ."

3550,"the us is a global power so is russia and china , they all want to be the dominants one , so no that's not an excuse for it to put blame on the us . while i will not deny the usa does some backhanded shit , it is no where near the level russia is currently doing , and has been doing , russia literally tried to bully finland and sweden to not join with threats and pressure , so another point made mute . ok again another instance where other countries do it too , the usa does preassure others to sanction russia , but have you seen the usa invade a country because of not implementing sanctions ?? no and countries have not been threatened with sanction on them for not having sanctions on russia , look at us israeli relationship , or all of africa , or even most of asia . one the dollar is not forced upon anyone besides those in the americas , and in most cases its not because they are threaten by it , but because its a more stable currency then their own . and in fact idk if you knew but europe uses euros for the most part not the us dollar . russia obviously opposes that , because russia wants to be a superpower again , so why in gods name would russia ever have the us dollar as their currency , that was never brought up anywhere in the last 40 years , and if it was its stupid . so your saying that a nation who's had luke warm relations at best and borderline hateful rival , broke a promise , one that was made verbally not on paper , to a nation that doesn't exist anymore ?? this points the dumbest one and is just to placate no fault . that revolution had nothing to do with the us , in fact it was about the european union , ukraine had wanted to start the process of integrating into the eu then russia pressured their president at the time to cancel the deal for more economic deals with russia , the people got upset and revolted . because the people wanted to join the eu of their own volition . it had nothing to do with the us , in fact the us didn't give 2 shits about ukraine until around last year . there was no cia plot to instigate a revolt , when russia caused it themselves . with decades of unwanted involvement in the region what do you mean take crimea through ukraine ??, you mean rightfully give back land that was ukrainian is the 50s under the soviet union ??? and was unlawfully annexed by russia ?? the anti russian sentiment is self inflicted , they constantly meddled in ukrainian politics , invaded then on 2 separate occasions in 10 years , considered ukraine as having no sovereignty . threaten them with war for wanting to protect themselves . in what way is that the us's fault . and of course the us is gonna help ukraine with training , its basic strategy . so now your mad that ukraine wanted protection so they started seeking help from the enemy's of the nation they were most afraid of ??? and asked for training , and wanted to enter into the said alliance , in which over 70 % of the population has to agree on in order for them to even start the process . i thought you were gonna give valid criticism but instead you made the points i had just disproven in my essay . honestly i'm disappointed , it took me 10 mins to right all of this while doing laundry , because your arguments had no basis in realty , just someone trying to play victim . when i specifically mentioned why if the us had done it it still would have been wronged and should and properly would have been condemned(cough cough look at iraq , most countries disapproved of the us's action , because they were wrong and unwarranted )"
3551,"> which is why a condition for russian to stop is ukraine to accept neutrality and demilitarisation . the problem with neutrality is that ukraine was neutral before 2014 and that ultimately didn't work for either ukraine or russia . i don't think the ukrainian government would agree to a neutral status ever again , even if they do it on paper they wouldn't be a neutral country in practice . > russia must continue to advance to keep its momentum how far do you think russia could advance in ukraine ? even though russia does have the upper hand in donbas at the moment and will likely make further gains in the east at this rate , the deeper they advance into ukraine , the more challenges they will face logistically in territory where russia is not as popular as donbas . this isn't to say russia can't win , but i don't think they can occupy all of ukraine in its entirety even if they can occupy a lot of it ."
3552,"odessa would be a strategic target for the russians for the reasons you listed . that said , before russia can capture odessa , they would need to launch a second battle for mykolaiv and who knows how long that will take ."
3553,"you are vastly overstating europe's reliance on russia . russia supplies less than 40 percent of european has and due to the eu being fully linked by pipelines , they can intake oil anywhere to help meet the supply needs somewhere else . is it a tight market ? of course , but if will not be anything like the "" war time "" economy you wish it was . here's a great overview of the situations and the plethora of backup options being reviewed . "" factbox : how can europe get gas if russia's supply is disrupted ? | reuters "" russians forget that the reliance in russian gas was a choice by europe to try to help russia's economy and integrate them with the western economies in the hopes of a more peaceful future . russia fucked it all up by being babies about nato ..."
3554,lol whatever you need to tel yourself to sleep at night
3555,yeah
3556,"and yet the free world would rather side with the us on its worst day than russia on its best day . the us is not good but nowhere near as bad as russia and china . if either of them were truly interested in becoming a peer power they would aim to be better than the us not worse , and that is why they will never succeed . ukranians know the west is not innocent or altruistic but compared to the russians its a much better option . just look at belarus , kazakhstan , venezuela , and cuba would you rather your future be like them or like the rest of the civilized world ? the us is not good , but we excel at being the best of the worst . it's not necessarily a new thing either our whole history has been brutal but compared to the monarchies and colonial empires of the 19th century , and the populist dictatorships of the 20th century the us has done a much better job . the journey for freedom will continue and the present iteration of our country will evolve into something better ( not without pain of course ) russia however seems doomed to go backwards ."
3557,the difference is that the ukraine opposition that they are targeting were taking bribes from russia and helping an attacking country . its not just an opposing viewpoint
3558,"only partly true . remember that the opposition in ukraine is generally considered a puppet regime . us has been independent for centuries . it takes several decades for a nation to build its identity , and until then , especially with external influences , things can be highly tumultuous and discriminatory ."
3559,> as long as putin has his obedient puppet government and they keep their people in check there's no war .
3560,there is no way the events of 2014 wouldn't have happened since yanukovych was such a bad guy
3561,"it was a conspiracy theory for more than 50 years that cia orchestrated 1953 iran coup . wait till 2070s/2080s and they will accept their role in this one too , if that the only thing that will convince you . otherwise , signs and parallels with other coup are all there ."
3562,yeah this turned into a pro-russian sub once the mods were ok with all the russians spamming submissions . fresh account or recently activated old accounts after certain accounts were banned . nothing to see here lol
3563,"good , then russia should pack up and go home and return territory to the newly de-nazified zelensky government ."
3564,"i mean , defending yourself against an aggressor definitely doesnt mean nothing "
3565,lol people will cheer this
3566,"wait what does your link have to do with anything ? that was an enemy of the ukrainian state who was appointed by russia to illegally govern occupied territory . that is very , very far from an innocent civilian death ... so i've seen tons of videos of russian soldiers shooting civilians ... then russians claiming that the ukrainians are doing the same thing ... i'm asking for proof that ukrainians are doing the same thing . or even evidence that the ukrainians shelled civilians in the donbas ? mostly see videos of destroyed infrastructure but no bodies , like in all the videos where russia clearly shelled civilians etc . just looking for proof that ukraine is just as bad as russia ..."
3567,you guys comment like you are 15 years old .
3568,look at you and your grown up jokes ! how was school today ?
3569,"the keyword here is "" hot "". everything pro ukraine is downvoted . why bother making a post which no one will see ? i can see people trying that , but they just get ridiculed here ."
3570,i looked at the content of the posts not pov . but usually ru pov is pro russia . it's even in the rules : >\- ru pov ( title and content are pro russian government pov ) i completely agree with you this is a good sub to see russian side even though i prefer telegram for that .
3571,"ukraine was arming , being trained and transformed into a more powerful proxy every day by usa . this war was inevitable . it was prepared since years by usa . just like usa prepares a war against china . we just don't know when it will be , but we know there will be one . putin could whose to wait or to start the war now . and now was the best moment ."
3572,"would you apply the same standards to the us ? nato ? every other country that has done this very thing ? if you are consistent , you would apply the same standard , and your opinion would be valid . if not , and you are just saying it because it's russia , then you are a hypocrite . this is something i would more people would figure out about themselves ."
3573,"i completely understand all of the points you made . but just out curiosity , how can you support the actions of russia when they are exactly the same as the wests ( specifically the us ). there is no doubt in my mind that every single war the us and nato have entered has been unjustified and generally wrong , but that doesnt excuse russia to do the very same thing ."
3574,ukraine can end this any day if they want to too . by your logic
3575,"please let me know how as another neighbour of mother russia we are supposed to stand by and just look as russia tries to "" follow peter the great "" ? if they are hellbent on war we do of course want to keep it at 1 war maximum and break the spirit there . if putin is not stopped or at least his army seriously bled we will have the same story in other former soviet states and other neighbours that could stand int he way"
3576,what we do know is that there are a lot of videos of soldiers dying and equipment getting blown up . any fast breakthrough manouvering seems to be suicidal with all the artillery and atgms around so i don't see any other way than slowly pushing forward with artillery against artillery and trenches . and ukraine got no shortage of men trained well enough to dig trenches and stay awhile as long as they keep morale up its gonna be a bloody treck for each village . at a max russia can hope for that ukraine looses heart from all the casualities and closes a deal for a bit more of the east or south unless they go full mobilization and declare open war
3577,"1 . you need to provide evidence to make such a claim 2 . again , if russia would release evidence of that i would agree . but they havent . so not true . 3 . lol dumbest argument ive ever sheen . russia is the aggressor . 4 . whattaboutism 5 . evidence ? 6 . whattaboutism please provide any evidence of journalism of your claims that ukraine does the same , or ever did the same ."
3578,"youre saying ukraine killed their own people in lysychansk ? what source do you have on that ? i also really wouldnt consider losing a small town a humiliation , considering all the battles they won in the north already ."
3579,wow lol ... the mental gymnastics it must take to think that using forced labor is a good thing lmao . what a nazi thing to say .
3580,so youre pro using north korean shave labor since the russians are kinder slave drivers ?
3581,digging your head into the sand i see
3582,"i'll remember you and come remind you to not play stupid games , when your country has to borrow from north korea to feed the people , once you lose . dumbasses like you are the reason your country is poor as fuck . you have no vision and only care for yourself . how long until noone wants to deal with you , if you screw over everyone you deal with ?"
3583,"you dont have to sympathize with ukrainians , and you are free to disagree , critique , put diplomatical pressure on , sanction etc . the ukranians for whatever you feel they are doing wrong . but you simply cannot justify a war of agression , a land-grab invasion of a sovereign country . history is riddled with blood , death , hatred and disorder , and can by no means justify wrongdoing today . you cannot wash yourself clean in the shit of others ."
3584,"tbh we probably spent more than that a year in afghanistan . sending russia who has done nothing but meddle with democracy back to the stone age for 56billion is a bargain price . the american people resoundingly support kicking russia's ass we are not perfect but everyone loves to see a bully get whats coming to them . the only time i've ever seen trumpers turn on their leader is when he said putin was a genius . i'm sure you would rather support the russians . you know the guys that think their neighbors wanting to be a democracy is a national security threat . we've supported way shadier people and gotten worse results . their government didn't flee , their troops didn't surrender , and they won't stop until russia loses crimea what's not to like ?"
3585,yehp thats an excellent summary .. but when you think about it the anglo-saxons that colonized america and the ukrainians are the same people at the end of the day edomites ( caucasians ) so they have to help their kin
3586,bit rich supporting biden and using paedophile as a slur .
3587,i hope he will one day cover this conflict
3588,"i see your point , however...is the value of this money greater than the detriment from providing natural resources needed to fuel the industrial production and economic output of countries that actively support a nation you're in a military conflict with ?"
3589,they caution against escalation while sending ukraine billions in weapons
3590,they ain't shit if the us isn't in on it .
3591,it's just for show . those talks mean nothing .
3592,"they dont even need to beg . take a look at russias demand . mr . putin sought guarantees that ukraine would never join nato , and he wanted nato allies to pull all troops and nuclear weapons from former soviet republics and nations that once belonged to the warsaw pact . he said in december that his demands must be addressed right away , right now. it is that simple , nato nukes are more than capable of reaching moscow from anywhere around the world , it's not the 50s they don't need to be that close . plus they can then introduce their own demands on russia too . it's called negotiations . people need to also look at this geopoliticaly and no just moraly . governments don give a fuck about morales , they don't care about what's right or wrong , they do what benefits them ."
3593,sounds like russia really should not have invaded to cause all of this ...
3594,"my big worry is that china now knows how weak russia is militarily . despite what china says about friendship with russia , china is only out for china . china lacks natural resources , but there are plenty of delicious resources to the north , enough to create chinese hegemony for the next 100 years . whether by military force or coercion of a weak , submissive neighbor , china be getting them resources , they need them ."
3595,"bollocks , nato shared borders with russia before the war with no issues at all ."
3596,"if you count civilian deaths then yes more ukranians have died , however russia seems to be less and less able to replace manpower and equipment losses while ukraine has mobilization and foreign volunteers and exiles , russian defectors etc ... a lot of the damage to ukraine can be repaired since the rest of europe is intact not so much for russia ( sanctions , isolation , loss of energy revenues )"
3597,"to you , but to many they are not . and that's those that matter to russia . russia doesn't want to lose chinese support for exemple ."
3598,"all the people in russia want is a peaceful , quiet life and development . i swear , no one here claims to take over other countries . we have the largest , richest country in the world . if no one interferes with the development of russia , then we have no interest in other countries , we are quite large and self-sufficient . not like china now , of course , but enough to live well . that's why the united states and its satellites hate us . it's my opinion . i don't know if you know how much pressure the us has put on other countries over the past 80 years . and this has increased greatly over the past 30 years after the collapse of the ussr . economically speaking , the us has the ability to earn one dollar to spend five thanks to the current global economic system that they maintain by bullying and destroying other countries . that is , the powerful economy of the united states is paid for by all other countries . the united states gained this opportunity during world war ii and the subsequent bretten woods agreement ( fixing the dollar as the single currency and pegging its value to gold at $ 35 per ounce ), which created a huge demand for dollars and a booming us economy . at that time , the us was consuming too many resources and was simply devouring its ( global ) economy . then , by 1971 , europe and japan had recovered from world war ii , and it became clear to everyone that the dollar was grossly overvalued . the us carried out the so-called nixon shock . they simply refused to pay the gold bills . and six years before that , there was degaulle's demarche ( this is also a very good indicator ) and since 1971 , the united states has put great pressure on all other countries with its military potential and the establishment of puppet political regimes to maintain the role of the dollar as the single world currency in order to maintain demand for the dollar . since 1944 , the us has directly invaded 33 countries ( in the end , this led to the death of about 11 million civilians ). this is not counting how many political puppet regimes they have established in other countries by paying for and conducting "" revolutions "" by replacing real national governments with their corrupt puppets ! and in response to your question , the russians simply want to cooperate while maintaining their sovereignty and national interests . we don't want nato on our borders , we don't have nuclear missiles in cuba . we're not going to attack anyone . we have everything we need . huge territory , huge reserves of energy and natural resources . we don't have overpopulation . we have great prospects if no one interferes with us ."
3599," however imo this conflict and the way american 5th colonists acted , will free us of their influence in the long run , since even more people are realising how much are these 5th colonists destroying europe through sanctions etc . i hope so . unfortunately , many people are deceived ."
3600,"what do you call what russia is doing ? unashamed of their warcrimes , assassinating political opponents , jailing peaceful protesters , thinking they are superior over other eastern european nations , extremist talking with other nations , threatening every nation that borders it . i've lived in ukraine , and i've lived in russia . i took part in the anti-war protests . i saw how nazi the russian government has become . when i was in ukraine , i traveled to almost every city . i saw no nazism ."
3601,"first off ... that's not what a nazi is . i even think most people in russia are white supremacists given the "" western liberal "" definition . second ... there isn't much credible evidence of them murdering or raping their own people , especially given the amount of blatant lies russia has told during this conflict . classic nazism is an ideology that believes war of expansion is necessary to keep the nation strong , that the nation should be ruled by a dictator with disregard to the parliament system . kind of sounds like russia ."
3602,"they held up the russian forces at mariupol for what , 83 days more than what russia planned for ? '' 3 days special operation ''"
3603,"lol but you say you'll "" hold off on hating russia "" and posted a very pro-russian statement criticizing aid to ukraine - where innocent civilians are currently being slaughtered en masse . besides criticizing biden for supporting ukraine , you didn't really offer any other reasons for why you would vote for a traitor . simple english indeed ..."
3604,"jesus , it sais dead ukrainians , not troops , it was talking about civilians : d typical pro-russian , reading is too difficult task for you :/"
3605,"100 000 ukrainians , not ukrainian troops . at least according to the article you linked ."
3606,"no , but it can be taken out of context and twisted into russian propaganda . "" hopes the figure is below 100,000 "" means nothing . it doesn't confirm 100,000 losses , and 100,000 ukrainian losses is not 100,000 ukrainian troop losses ."
3607,"> this gonna do more harms than good more harm to who ? usa weapon corporations will sell more weapons , it's doing more good to them for exemple . zelensky's wife will get a nice job and zelensky will make many $ 1 million conferences , also more good for them . not everyone consider ukrainians dying does them harm . lot of people have different interests"
3608,"> as it is right now , most of their frontline experienced troops in donbass are either dead / fatally injured under shelling , or encircled and imprisoned . that's not what i read in not-propaganda russian/separatists telegram channel . google-translate : > despite the statements of propaganda , the ukrainian units of the armed forces of ukraine in the donbas are more likely to be squeezed out than defeated . > the main reason is the lack of forces , which does not allow to concentrate efforts in the right areas . > the situation was similar in the "" fortress "" gorskoe-zolotoe - despite heavy losses , the enemy managed to withdraw the core of his garrison from the operational encirclement > few prisoners were taken . we can say that our "" mites captured the air ""."
3609,how are they nazis ?
3610,i know a lot of ukrainians and none of them are nazis
3611,no they arent lol . that was like a decade ago you propaganda believing nut job .
3612,i came here for the same reason .
3613,it's more than just deleting posts . cf mods have been shadow banning and outright banning users and giving zero reasons for it . not even acknowledging it .
3614,some users post more than 3 good posts a day . also i'd have to count posts because automod can't count .
3615,"i'm not a spammer , all content is new and if it's been posted already its deleted . the information and videos from this war come out fast and often . when i found this sub it was 90 +% all pro-russia . this sub taught me how to cross post because you'd think nothing bad was going on for the russians . why don't you post like we do ? as for trolling i've had plenty of reasonable discussions with the people here . i respond with the same demeanor i'm subjected to ."
3616,don't lash out at him just because you're upset at his narrative about this war . post some content .
3617,"yes but russian imperialism is much better . it doesn't export so far , less consumerism , less corruption/corporatism/lobbies , no "" progressism "", no currency inflation , no sanctions to disobedient countries , no funding coups and revolts in other countries , less interventionism . so i'm happy to be plundered by russia rather than usa , but also , since russia is less imperialist and also weaker , it will be easier for my country to resist than for usa ."
3618,"those are all very convenient points that do not take into account one simple factor . this is not a us vs russia conflict . it's a ukraine vs russia conflict . ukranians have a right to self determination that russia cannot control but neither can the us . from the us perspective europe is not a priority , asia is the priority for commercial and security concerns in the 21st century . the us has little interest getting bogged down in european problems when we should be focusing in the pacific . the us does not benefit from ukranians wanting to join nato but it can't well stop them either . their people widely support further integration with europe . they see the standard of living in poland , the baltics , and finland and would take that anyday over being a vassal of russia like belarus or kazakhstan . both of which their people have revolted similarly to ukraine only to be put down by russian security forces . the integrity of russian influence relies on squashing self determination , something they have failed at and continue to fail at in ukranie just like the ussr did . the "" democratically elected government "" that was suspiciously pro russian ignored a popular referendum in favor of trade with the eu . their government influenced by russia was acting against its people's sovereignty , when the people protested they shot them in the streets . russia could have reached out for commercial ties , it could've sweetened the deal and competed with the west for ukranie's favor instead their matra is "" love mother russia or else ...."" they cannot fathom treating ukraine like an ally and an equal instead they need a vassal . ukranians are tired of being vassals . the us did not force the uk , germany , or france to join nato they did so based on mutual benefit and the will of their people , if any of those countries withdrew from the alliance it would be a blow but the us wouldn't invade them to overthrew their government because we know what's best for them . because of the will of their people ukranie has not collapsed like afghanistan did . if they did not want to be a democracy they would not have lasted this long . the west respects that and supports them accordingly ."
3619,"100 % agree , i am lucky to have the safety of the us(besides being a minority and growing up in the era of mas shootings ) but as a true patriot i will never shy away from criticizing our selves for our imperialism . imperialism is bad no matter the culprit , it just happens to be russia trying to become imperialistic again ."
3620,"\> what do you mean take crimea through ukraine ??, you mean rightfully give back land that was ukrainian is the 50s under the soviet union ??? and was unlawfully annexed by russia ?? crimea was annexed to the ukrainian ssr at the whim of khrushchev . there was a russian majority in crimea . then it would not cause a sensation , because , it would seem , we live in the same country ! it doesn't matter that something is given to someone , we are in the ussr ! but when the ussr collapsed , khrushchev's gift was reflected . maidan began in 2014 . many simply did not like the [ murders of journalists ]( and the silent connivance of the authorities in connection with the [ crimes of ]( [ the radicals ]( so many in crimea supported reunification with russia . it's really a huge pro-russian region . no fifth column happened when crimea returned to russia . same thing with donbass . donbass was annexed to ukraine by lenin's decree to form the ukrainian ssr , until that moment there was always a russian majority in the donbass . if there had not been a pro-russian majority in the lpr or dpr , i think that these quasi-republics would not have been formed in principle . \> the anti russian sentiment is self inflicted , they constantly meddled in ukrainian politics , invaded then on 2 separate occasions in 10 years , considered ukraine as having no sovereignty . threaten them with war for wanting to protect themselves . in what way is that the us's fault . and of course the us is gonna help ukraine with training , its basic strategy . so now your mad that ukraine wanted protection so they started seeking help from the enemy's of the nation they were most afraid of ??? and asked for training , and wanted to enter into the said alliance , in which over 70 % of the population has to agree on in order for them to even start the process . [ anti-russian ]( and [ nationalist ]( sentiments existed even before the maidan . just look at organizations close to the [ right sector ]( yes , even before it ! \> ok again another instance where other countries do it too , the usa does preassure others to sanction russia , but have you seen the usa invade a country because of not implementing sanctions ?? no and countries have not been threatened with sanction on them for not having sanctions on russia , look at us israeli relationship , or all of africa , or even most of asia . have you ever visited wikileaks ? have you read the afghan war diary to say that the us is not at the level of russia ? intimidating finland and sweden is a common geopolitical move against pax americana . perhaps i need to explain that the world lives on pax americana , but there are countries that do not want to live on pax americana . there is another question for the us . 9/11 was arranged by two people on student visas from saudi arabia . why did the us attack iraq ? and further . why did the us support the syrian opposition , which differs from the terrorists only by a shoulder patch and which soldiers killed an 8-year-old boy because they considered him a spy for bashar al-assad ? needless to say , one hegemon is purer than another , for every superpower has its skeletons in the closet . the us could not pressure countries for not implementing sanctions , but they could well afford to bomb yugoslavia or invade iraq . \> that revolution had nothing to do with the us , in fact it was about the european union , ukraine had wanted to start the process of integrating into the eu then russia pressured their president at the time to cancel the deal for more economic deals with russia , the people got upset and revolted . because the people wanted to join the eu of their own volition . it had nothing to do with the us , in fact the us didn't give 2 shits about ukraine until around last year . there was no cia plot to instigate a revolt , when russia caused it themselves . with decades of unwanted involvement in the region and further . about maidan . maidan was primarily against the president and only after his resignation for joining the european union . and imagine , there really were and are people who did not want to join the european union and wanted to be with russia . imagine , there were people who were against the crimes in iraq , taking place with the tacit connivance of the european union . or do you not consider these people to be people ?"
3621,"you are in denial . not gonna repeat myself on everything > but have you seen the usa invade a country because of not implementing sanctions literally all countries usa invaded directly or by proxy did not implement sanctions , the others are sanctioned by usa and countries usa forces to apply sanctions ( iran ). i will ask a reverse question since you are in denial , do you know a country that is not implementing sanctions and is left alone by usa ? no , if you don't , you are sanctioned or attacked . the dollar is forced upon everyone . forced doesn't mean using it as currency , it means holding some as reserves . what you call "" stable "" is literally the least stable currency . and it's why countries and corps are forced to hold it . because dollar works as an insurance against usa's bullying and instability . usa has the biggest invasion army because usa is the biggest invader and the biggest bully , it's not to defend itself . it's literally usa's business model . force people to hold dollar and distribute inflation to them by printing "" free "" dollars . crimea is russian . and crimeans wanted to join russia . when people want to join eu we have to listen but when they want to join russia no ?"
3622,"> the reliance in russian gas was a choice by europe because "" russian "" oligarchs sold the resources with huge discounts , and invested all the benefits not in russia . > russia fucked it all up by being babies about nato . russia fucked it all up by having complaints about being the west's whore ."
3623,"proof for any of these ? who in each of the 11 party took brides from russia ? and who in each of the 11 party helping an attacking country ? or are you just parroting zelensky talking point ? cause : [ all this signals that the ukrainian governments decision to suspend left-wing and opposition parties has little to do with any objective war-time security needs of ukraine , and much to the with the post-euromaidan polarisation of ukrainian politics and redefinition of the ukrainian identity that pushed a variety of the dissenting positions beyond the borders of tolerable discourse in the country . it also has to do with zelenskyys attempts to consolidate political power that began long before the russian invasion .]("
3624,"that's parallel is questionable at best to point to the west . iran coup was a coup and us desired a puppet govt there . who orchestrated/funded it was under question . ukraine didn't have a coup . in fact the far right lost seats in their recent elections . the fact that all this coincided with the finding of oil and gas in ukraine , and russia losing its spring govt makes me fairly convinced that this was a putin and oligarchy fearing competition in fossil fuel and its ability to keep eu under wraps slipping . the targeted areas are very clearly for black area dominance . the coup at best was attempted by the donbas region . to top it - given no historic leader ( or current ) has stayed in power under a democratic process for long and not later been found to be manipulative and far an underlying agenda , i highly doubt that russia under putin is any different . unfortunate truth of being human - people will ge failures and would want to raise their voice . so b you need to create an enemy and use hysteria and information manipulation to subjugate the mass ."
3625,"it means nothing . just like fighting nazis means nothing . it's just "" we good , opponent bad "". there are many variations of this argument in religion wars you had "" fighting infidels "". you have "" fighting tyrans "", etc ... this kind of simple moral argument is necessary for the part of the population that has no critical thinking , which is a lot of people if not the majority"
3626,"so you say pro-ukrainian would cheer on the killing of civilians , as long as it's on russian side ?"

3628,"to answer your question , i don't think you understand the meaning of the word ' civilian ' it's not matter if the town leader was enemy of ukrainian state or if he kick seal before breakfast . fact is : he was not a combatant , nor station in direct combat zone . so he is classified as a civilian for all of the meaning of that word if you look at the other way around , can the russian bomb every city townhall in russia , and claimed that they didn't bomb civilian targets ?"
3629,its a copium for children whos fathers have been sent to die at the hands of a dictator for no good reason .
3630,"** 2nd ** all time post is an ukrainian helicopter blowing a russian depot . if you post good oc ukrainian content it will be upvoted . pro-ukraine content is just less good nowadays , because they lose , and because we see those videos on other subs ."
3631,"that ones not downvoted because of its content , but because of who posted it ."
3632,"welp , at least this sub tries . there are some full-on tankies of course but the majority of the people i found rather pleasant to have discussions with ( or simply to read somebody else's discussions )."
3633,"equivalently you could say that ukraine was being armed , trained against a very much real threat of russian invasion with increasing russian presence in the area and increasing support of the separatist regions . thats why preemptive strikes are bs , its far too easy to call , especially with constant propaganda demonizing each other and its the kind of rational that would have pulled us into a nuclear war during the soviet years , on either side . the only way to genuinely preserve peace is a strict rule of limiting yourself to retaliatory strikes . i just dont buy that war was inevitable . the us has armed several countries for decades without any resulting armed conflict . and yes , the arms that ukraine had been receiving * were * defensive . at the start of the war , ukraine had no western tanks or other armoires vehicles , no aircraft , no artillery , no missiles , ukraine had been relying on old soviet stock for all of those categories , definitely not a force with which you could launch an invasion against a military superpower . those are only now ( very reluctantly ) being given several months into the war ."
3634,"very much depends on the context . second iraq war , probably libya ( though thats a smaller scale ), id consider illegitimate ."
3635,"the ukrainians didn't deserve this and i do sincerely hope this war ends as soon as possible . because the longer it draws out the biggest loser is the ukrainian people , now for their government it's a whole other reason . sure they have nazies , but i don't belive its enough a reason to invade another country but when your sworn enemies set up camp in your backyard with their missiles and all , it's only logical to not let that happen , and to create as much of a buffer between you as possible . and as i mentioned smaller stuff like the blatant propaganda , the russophobia all tends to add up and pushed me from neutral to pro russia . only winners from this are raytheon and lockheed martin"
3636,thats not how invasions work lol . better dead than living under a fascist boot . youre engaging in logical fallacies because you have no good argument .
3637,"dont let ukrainian and western propaganda fool you . the ukrainian army faces serious problems with morale , there are reports of mass desertion both from russian and western intelligence , and there are dozens of telegram channels where people warn each other of conscript raids in ukrainian cities . some anonymous users openly declare that in case of siege , they will give away ukrainian forces exact positions in residential areas to russians so their cities wont be destroyed chaotically like mariupol or severodonetsk . of course , they might be russian bots , but there are definitely many real people who will do that ."
3638,we also know russians have 10x-20x as much firepower in donbass and they have been hitting ukrainians hard in last few months . its clear they are going with the attrition warfare route . if this continues russians will break the camels back . also western donbass is fortified and has natural obstacles . west of kramatorsk its just plains . if they break ukrainians in donbass it will be very difficult for ukrainians to stop them .
3639,"> please provide any evidence of journalism of your claims that ukraine does the same , or ever did the same . the only reason for you to know nothing about the theme after all these months/years is that you don't want to know . > whattaboutism yeah , that's a favorite word of genocidal nazis . as if that gives them some sort of immunity from punishment for their crimes . maybe that's why russians are no longer talking with nazis . that's what a genuine pro russian supporter would answer to your genuine question , kek ."
3640,"oh lysychansk is a small town ? lysychansk and sievierodonetsk were ukraine's 44th and 46th largest cities , which is equivalent to miami , oakland or long beach for the us . that also made 15 out of 50 ukrainian largest cities to be in russian hand right now . or as you put it , there are only another 35 ' small towns ' that russian need to conquer to take over ukraine"
3641,"what forced labor ? from what i have read/watched about nkoreans working in china and russia , they are quite glad to work abroad , because it's paid well , etc . of course , i know , you would prefer to genocide them instead of allowing them to work and get paid ."
3642,it's not like you're going to make the nkoreans free . why then you're against allowing them to enjoy russian liberties ?
3643,isn't some filtration necessary for finding nazis and hanging them ? but i doubt the russians are doing the filtration thing as properly as it's told in the fake news . they do not have enough armed people to guard all the civilians .
3644,lol iam french by the way 
3645,"as far as american interventions go , even if ukraine collapsed tomorrow this would be a more successful one than any the us has been in for a very long time . that being said , its still up for debate as to whether or not this was strategically sound . i can mostly understand the position the biden administration is taking , though it is in effect conceding that they have no ability to sway russia away from china , and that russia is lost to us as a tool for containing china ."
3646,"to be clear , over 80 % of republicans support biden on ukraine , so nothing im saying is exactly controversial ."
3647,if you can't handle the heat then get out the wild wild west .
3648,"i do believe that theres clear evidence that continental europe was hoping/preparing for a less militaristic future , prior to the ukraine episode . they werent planning on war with russia . pretty much all of western europe was slowly phasing out their military prior to 2014 . i dont see any reason to believe that they want a larger war with russia . and i mean , its not just show that germany/france have been much slower in their military shipments to ukraine ( which they have gotten flak for )."
3649,"since the fall of the soviet union russia has gone to war with moldova , georgia , chechnya(twice ) and ukraine(twice ) all the former warsaw pact countries that don't join nato get attack . if you were a one of those countries would you listen to the war mongers ? or join nato ? you say russia should get to tell the baltic countries where they store their nukes . shouldn't the baltics also be able to tell russia where to store theirs ?"
3650,but it can't all be blamed on russia . the west made choices and some of those choices caused harm .
3651,"> there's no fucking way i would want the rf or the ccp anywhere near me , my loved ones or my country . isn't this you ? \^ if there is no issue ? why didn't you want the russian anywhere near your country ? just being racist ?"
3652,"that's a bit short-sighted . do you think that ukraine would still be fighting this war if there wouldn't be so much support coming in from the west ? by losing the information war , russia pretty much condemned itself to a bloody and long conflict ."
3653,"i understand that people want cooperation and to be part of the international community , that is probably universal everywhere . but to put north korea as an edge case , it is not realistic in all cases . and am i wrong to assume that people understand that the ship of constructive relations with any of the western nations has sailed , or do they believe the west will invite , or be forced to invite , russia back into cooperation ? other than the west , there is always china to try and have a partnership with , do people believe china does not view russia in an extractive sense , the way you say west views russia ? if so , is russia to switch from an european country to an asian one ? or is isolation the goal , and you want to drift away from the world , carving your own independent world order in the sphere you are to maintain ? is it something else entirely ? or put it simply , the * want * and the * can * are often different things . it is normal for people to * want * the best , but i'm interested on what people believe they * can * get best . so no one will interfere with russia , what will russia do , who it's friends will be and so on ."
3654,"holy shit , such delusion . russia has the life expectancy of a european country from 80 years ago . it is a pathetic mafia run gas station . the people of russia are so blinded by misguided patriotism they nod along happily as an elite takes them all for the fools they are proving themselves to be ."
3655,"azov flag is pretty explicitly nazi , bro . black sun and wolsangel of ss panzer 2 division is about as nazi-symbolism as you get . i agree that they are not real nazis - just wannabe slav farmers who thought they in some way shape or form can relate to german nazis . german nazis wanted to take on the world order(a little too ambitiously ), ukrainian wanna-be nazis are looking to be servants and pawns to eu and nato . not to mention having jewish leadership . it's a really sad situation only driven by them being brainwashed to hate russians . most hardcore azovites either ended up being killed , maimed or now imprisoned because kiev leadership didn't mind abandoning them . they gained nothing from this role-playing , and they lost everything ."
3656,"and why is the [ ukrainian government better ]( or even american . read about us war crimes in syria , iraq . read about who the us supported in the syrian conflict and find out that the syrian opposition differs from the terrorists in a patch . find out that the us reacted moderately when the terrorists they supported killed an 8-year-old boy because they thought he was a spy for bashar al-assad . look at how people with their pants down are tied to trees and beaten in ukraine . look at the [ shootouts ]( of radicals in ukraine . the list can be continued for a long time . ukraine in relation to people is even worse than russia in a sense . you're trying to whitewash someone , but everyone has skeletons in their closet . all russian war crimes are witnessed by pro-ukrainian media . the media should not deal with human rights issues . we have no choice but to wait for the analysis of the international center . or believe the media , who have deceived more than once , and be blind . in my memory , there was the only war crime when a ukrainian tank ( it was still passed off as a russian one , but it didnt have z or v and it was of a completely different production line ) ran over a car . and what you didn't see means it wasn't there , it doesn't mean anything . literally , "" i held the brain in my hand - i know everything ."" i understand perfectly . i also had mixed feelings in the early days . but you don't have to deny everything you don't like ."
3657,warcrimes you know you cant believe all the russophobic ukrainian propaganda
3658,"\> second ... there isn't much credible evidence of them murdering or raping their own people , especially given the amount of blatant lies russia has told during this conflict google the bombing of the petrovsky district of donetsk or , in principle , look at the chronology of the war on the eastern front since 2014 . a lot of civilians were killed . \> first off ... that's not what a nazi is . i even think most people in russia are white supremacists given the "" western liberal "" definition . you , apparently , do not know the history of the azov , aidar , donbass battalions at all . for you , even nazi stripes are not a sign of sympathy for the ideas of the nation . maybe even their own words are not a sign ? completely blind vision of the situation . azov and aidar were known just for torturing people , you can find a lot of information about this on your own . you literally justify the terrorists , who do not differ in methods from the terrorists in syria . they themselves called for the russians to be slaughtered and allowed them to shoot at those who were "" without a bandage ."" i also advise you to look at the emblems of these battalions and the symbols on them , which "" mean nothing ."" the definition of "" western liberal "" has no problem . there is liberalism in relation to the western model of the state and liberalism in relation to the russian model of the state . i need to explain that there are things that have certain properties relatively ? there is a liberal in relation to the western state and a liberal in relation to the russian state . moreover , there is not a single armed nazi formation at the state level . \> classic nazism is an ideology that believes war of expansion is necessary to keep the nation strong , that the nation should be ruled by a dictator with disregard to the parliament system . kind of sounds like russia . you came up with a new definition , which is also logically contradictory . in the definition of nazism , there is no expansion to preserve the nation , this comes as a consequence . nazism itself is the idea of the superiority of one nation over another . if you had said about militarism , this could still be understood . russia invaded ukraine to save citizens of the lpr and dpr . and you're a racist if you don't recognize them as human beings . how the situation could have been handled in a different way is quite another question . your comment is just an emotional judgment based on the seen pro-ukrainian takes . please review more information ."
3659,"yeah . i said ill hold off until people who did this before are held accountable . nothing complex in that sentence . do you enjoy cherry-picking ? makes it easy to fit your narrative right ? under biden , sc overturned roe v wade . financial assistance to american families completely stopped ( advanced credit ). student loans are still not forgiven . despite having majority , theyre still being cucked by republicans . inflation . gas prices . gun violence . i can go on . and dems have the power but they dont exercise it . theyre protesting while theyre in power . theyre pathetic morons . trump sighed and executive order for either stimulus or ue i dont quite remember . people challenged his authority but americans benefited . no i dont support what happened on jan 6th . that was wrong . like i said before , i dont even support the scum bags like cruz , mtg , boebert , gaetz etc . i dont even agree with many of republican policies . but goddammit i support a leader who can actually make decisions and do something . biden has only been good for ukraine . and they didnt vote for him . we did . hes also threatening iran now . joy . honestly . fuck him . never getting my vote again . i rallied for him and got many people to vote for him . what a waste of my time ."
3660,"thats why i added the numbers of ukranian civioan deaths on both sides . total they dont reach 20,000 . so that leaves over 81,000 dead ukranians troops . at least . its probably more , according to the defense minister of ukraine"
3661,"i don't trust any words / opinions coming from any sides . fact however , is either the ukraine has withdrawn from lysychansk-sievierodonetsk since long . or they will get brutally mauled during their retreat now , cause the russian already closed down their escape road . regardless , they should have thrown everything in to hold on to popasna to secure their flank , instead of the counterattacks / trying to hold onto sievierodonetsk . i don't care what is the 180 iq plan , but losing lysychansk and letting the russian takes major foothold on the other side of the siversky river is massive massive loss"
3662,aren't you're one of the - not-nazis - who think that genociding russians is an awesome idea ?
3663,i noticed this too . many users have been purged for the most innocuous things . it turns out the mods are the same between cf and worldnews .
3664,"i figured as much . this site is a meme for a reason but the next level propaganda around this was is something else . i noticed great combat footage like the ua platoon getting ambushed just disappears . or like the announcement on wn about zelensky banning another party and making 1 tv station just disappears for "" misinfo """
3665,this is hilarious . are you going on all the pro ukranian forums and posting russian videos . its funny how pro ukranians act when they find out how the war is really going for them this is probably the only place on reddit you can get an idea of how the war is going and without having to read all the low quality posts like fuck putin or slava ukrani
3666,"you've obviously never spent any time in russia if you don't think there is "" consumerism "". and you've obviously never studied russian history if you think there is no interventionism or inflation"
3667,"less corruption ? really ? owning billions of dollars in offshore banks , building multiple mansions and killing/jailing anyone reporting on it isnt corruption at all ."
3668,"this is fucking nonsense . russian imperialism is much worse than american . in few years things might change and the us might be worse,b who knows . i just wish us and russia get together and do wonders like the space station . i love both countries and even ukraine . it's an absurd war"
3669,and no democracy . most corrupt country on earth . no freedom of speech . leader poisons or imprisons any opposition . well on its way to becoming another north korea . people in canada don't lose sleep over biden deciding to seize a couple of provinces or blowing up toronto .
3670,"> the us does not benefit from ukranians wanting to join nato but it can't well stop them either . while i mostly agree , the us is in fact the only nation that could guarantee this . if the us came out and said definitively they would not be joining nato , that would be that . > russia could have reached out for commercial ties , it could've sweetened the deal and competed with the west for ukranie's favor this simply isn't possible . russia just doesn't have nearly enough to offer . they can't offer the carrot , all they have is the stick . this isn't meant as a criticism as much as a simple statement of fact . hard power is their only real tool at this point . > the us did not force the uk , germany , or france to join nato they did so based on mutual benefit and the will of their people , if any of those countries withdrew from the alliance it would be a blow but the us wouldn't invade them to overthrew their government because we know what's best for them now ? no . in the middle of the cold war ? ahhh , yeah , actually , i think the us quite possibly would have if it came down to it . much like the ussr in hungary , they were in their sphere , and if they wanted to switch sides , that's a big no-no . they happily did similar things all over south america through the cold war to keep any potential soviet influence out . democracy was great so long as everyone voted correctly . just ask chile about that one ."
3671,"it honestly seems you haven't read my post , because i already gave you examples for each of your new points . learn to do proper research instead of listening to propaganda . unlike you i acknowledge when america is being imperialistic , and have stated many times that i hate our imperialism , and wish we were more generous rather then over reactive , but all you do is find excuses for a dictatorship that had no right to invade ukraine . not only that but crimea is not russian , it hasn't been since the early soviet union . know your history . and please if you think i will believe a totalitarian regime is doing what the people want , then your just crazy"
3672,"> so b you need to create an enemy and use hysteria and information manipulation to subjugate the mass . sure , that's how it works everywhere . ukraine , russia , usa , europe , china , etc . you're all using hysteria and information manipulation to subjugate the mass , funding coups and shouting "" no you ""."
3673,"no , people would cheer killing of illegally imposed governments ."
3674,you can have pro russian discussions alright . but anything pro ukraine gets downvoted to hell .
3675,"except russia wanted to negotiate and ukraine/usa not . so yes when negociations can't go anywhere we end in war . russia saw negotiations where impossible , they had the choice to become an us puppet more or less or accept war ."
3676,"what is a "" legitimate "" war to you ?"
3677,"> better dead than living under a fascist boot . yes , that's why dpr and lpr are fighting against nazi ukraine ."
3678,lol comical if true
3679,"my point still stands . in february if you told me youd be gloating about this , we all would talk about how embarrassing that is lol regardless . source up or shut up ."
3680,yes because making north koreans free would entail war . russian liberties .... every single country in eastern europe tasted the soviet yoke and wants none of their liberty
3681,wow holy shit im literally speaking to an ss wannabe . christ what a fucked up world russian propaganda has brought you up in .
3682,"that is true , however russia is rapidly becoming a liability china is not happy about . the rising fuel and food prices are not something china is excited for since they import plenty of both . getting russia out of the game also weakens their relations with india since they have no surplus weapons to supply them and allows the us and quad to fill that role . russia has also galvanized europe against territorial expansion and united them on sanctions , both of which are critical if china were to invade taiwan . the advantage on relations with eu , india etc ... is very much worth the effort . it's been a risky move but putin was the one that decided to invade so you gotta shift accordingly ."
3683,"thing is they are puppets of the us , they can't do shit not approved by washington"
3684,this is true and its also incredibly naive of the european powers . i have less issue with france . they maintained a robust military and focused on energy independence . but the germans were foolish
3685,umm ... no ... no one did anything warranting a full scale war in ukraine . pretending it was justified is clearly russian propaganda .
3686,it can and it should be blamed entirely on russia .
3687,"west support is dead to russia . they are not trying to get it and they don't count on it . they are ready for a long war , and more than us ."
3688,"i hope , i even count on the fact that in the near future the united states will lose the opportunity to put pressure on the eu countries . and then relations between russia and these countries will be restored and strengthened ( trade , scientific , security ). russia is counting on it . because for many years we have had good relations with europe . now , of course , russia is focusing on china as a buyer of resources and energy . and in terms of trade , since china is the largest economy in the world and is not averse to cooperating with russia . given that the us is also putting pressure on china ( trade wars ). it is easier for us to find a common language and common interests . i think it's good . i don't think there are supporters of isolation in russia . in any case , there are very few of them and among my acquaintances i do not know such . on the contrary , over the past 10-20 years , russians have become accustomed to vacationing abroad and having close ties , including in europe . a few years ago i was thinking about buying a house in spain . spain has a good climate and several of my friends have moved there to live . therefore , many russians have a very negative attitude towards the closure of borders with the eu . i hope this is all temporary and ends soon ."
3689,"i think kiev saw mariupol as the perfect opportunity to be rid of the stain of the azov battalion . even if they could have rescued them , they probably wouldnt have"
3690,"so you don't support republicans or any of their policies , but here you are on a soapbox saying you will still vote for them ... sc overturned roe because of trump's assault on scotus and stealing of seats dems can't get anything done because manchin votes more in line with republicans , and the gop has used gerrymandering to make it near impossible for the dems to gain a super majority . but yeah let's keep voting them in because biden couldn't fix everything in 2 years during a pandemic , economic crisis , and war in europe . thanks for your input , ivan !"
3691,"you compare confirmed civilian losses with estimated total losses , which makes no sense ."
3692,"who's genociding russians ? are you insane ? who is in russia's borders ? russians are in ukraine , how stupid do you have to be ? if you want to putin to have ukraine just say it , we can say what we see . who tried to march on moscow or any russian city ? who annexed parts of ukraine and flattened their cities ? who invaded georgia and annexed their land ? who invaded chechnya and annexed their land ? every country has some nazis including russia in a big way , it doesn't mean putin gets to steal the land . this is why we send arms . this is why we all want a free ukraine . russia back to russia"
3693,one of them mods a socialist firearm subreddit and he was banning people for calling out azov/right sector . i could not stop laughing at the irony .
3694,"> this is hilarious . are you going on all the pro ukranian forums and posting russian videos . no need to , most of the ones i see here are there , granted they're downvoted to all hell . if you would like to add more pro-russia material on those subs the crosspost option is always available . > its funny how pro ukranians act when they find out how the war is really going for them i'm pro-ukranian but i'm under no illusion that the ukranians are dominating . part of my reason for posting here was the complete lack of anything damning to russia . every pro-ua post wasn't pro-ua at all . the comments section and posts would have you believe not a single casualty had occurred on the russian side . maybe you dont know how the war is really going for them . cheerlead all you want , russians are dying too and i think its important to emphasize that . sure , you took a city , but at what cost ? sure the ukranians defended a city , but at what cost ? they can be expendable numbers to you but they're all people . > this is probably the only place on reddit you can get an idea of how the war is going exactly , so why not have the information come in on both sides ? i upvote russian material too . i just don't post anything glorifying or justifying this war . i try to stick to the human element involved and drive home the point that war is brutal and people that should be alive right now are dead , on both sides . > and without having to read all the low quality posts like fuck putin or slava ukrani i've never posted a single one of these and don't agree with them . i do my best to avoid anything inflammatory and have real discussions with the people here . it's easy for anybody to sit and throw insults at strangers on the internet but what is accomplished ? nothing . both parties involved continue to hate eachother even more than they did before with more conviction . i'd rather have a civil conversation and atleast get some insight and understanding to what the pro-russian side believes they are fighting for . what is accomplished ? probably still nothing but atleast some words that weren't insults were exchanged ."
3695,"we have no democracy either , voting for choice a or choice b every 5 years is not a democracy . usa is the most corrupt country on earth , it's so corrupt bribes are even legal and organised by lobbies . we have no freedom of speech either , you can only say what us corporations allow you to say ( try to link any russian website ). if you are too problematic in usa you end up worse than in prison : you lose your job . in most of eu those same forbidden subjects are punished by prison too . people in canada are not armed by russia and transformed into a proxy , otherwise biden would attack all the same ."
3696,i can honestly say that i have more freedom of speech in russia and ukraine than i ever did in the usa
3697,""" this simply isn't possible . russia just doesn't have nearly enough to offer . they can't offer the carrot , all they have is the stick . this isn't meant as a criticism as much as a simple statement of fact . hard power is their only real tool at this point ."" i think that's part of the bigger picture of why russia is acting do insecure . i would wager its due more to internal than external factors . for instance their terrible life expectancy , crumbling demographics , and crashed educational system . russia is essentially incompatible with modern service based economy . to adapt much less reverse any of these problems it would take a massive overhaul of russian society which is not compatible with putin staying in power . still he has to make something happen because in relative terms russia's power is shrinking fast . so he has fomented discord in democracies , and as you say relied on hard power . the issue is there's only so much you can do there . this is imo putin's greatest blunder due to his background , he very much took the easy route and is now running into a dead end . in a rational world he would've tried to be a bridge between the west and china , but i imagine he distrust both sides enough to try to remake his own sphere of influence . unfortunately in failing to do making it much more likely russia will be less and less able to resist china ."
3698,i only saw the ' happy to see them die ' types of posts downvoted . which is ... good ?
3699,"the war was already at a standstill with little casualties . you dont get the right to declare war just because negotiations arent going fast enough for your taste . putin absolutely had the ability to maintain the status-quo , which while imperfect , wouldve been better than the current war for all civilian parties involved . and i mean - yes , there were absolutely things that the west was willing to negotiate on . again , the eu was pressuring ukraine on several ( but not all ) issues that russia had , including the far right elements and discriminatory laws . ukraine does have elections and regularly changing rulers ( in fact , im 90 % sure zelensky wouldnt have survived the next election without the war ) a different outcome with a different ruler could have been possible . you just dont know if there are no diplomatic options available , and a cold standstill is still preferable to an open large scale war ."
3700,"thats very complicated of course . a defensive war is certainly legitimate , and helping a clearly democratic nation against an invasion will always be legitimate . if there is evidence of active , violent and large-scale genocide , that will be a legitimate war ( i.e . intervening in rwanda would have been legitimate ). if an autocrat oppresses the problem will of his nations people and violently denies the possibility of the establishment of democracy , that might be legitimate . its a difficult question that needs to be addressed case by case . all legitimate war must stem from an urgent and immediate need , however , to prevent clearly more damage than it creates ."
3701,lol comical .
3702,"yeah in february , if you tells me that the us economy going to go into recession and european government officers have to resign one after another because of their sanction onto russia . i will also talk about how embarrassing it must be too . on 2nd point , you seemed a bit dense on this . so let me walking through it for you then you asked for source , right ? cause the question contains a controversial assumption right ? and that the framing of question is not genuine , right ? right ? that is called a loaded question . and a clear example of it is ""* how do pro russian supporters feel about russian indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas in clear retaliation of the damage inflicted on them by himars ?*"" got it ?"
3703,"every country of middle east , latin america , south east asia and africa also tasted western europe (+ america ) ' freedom and democracy ' and none really like it . so don't pretend that there is a better version of whatever russia is spreading"
3704,"> every single country in eastern europe tasted the soviet yoke and wants none of their liberty some posters in serbia , two weeks ago . eu go home serbia=russia that is our union !"
3705,"they do and very much have . europe doesnt participate in all american wars . france openly condemned the iraq war from the start , for example ( germany merely disapproved of itc they tend to be less involved , and the uk supported it . but , as said , the stances and actions of the nations are independent ). the eu has also had plenty of economic tensions with the us , several trade wars . i think describing them as puppets would be inaccurate . the us just simply has a much larger military and is able to carry out any operations entirely by themselves if they need to , what concerns military interventions ."
3706,"its not about west supporting russia its about how much they would be willing to oppose , and they're pretty willing now ."
3707,the western financial and tech world is not dead to russia .
3708,> west support is dead to russia . then russia condemned themselves to stay in the stone age . lmao
3709,"as long as russia sees itself as a pole in a multipolar world relations with europe will deteriorate , if putin and i say putin because he is the architect of this crisis continues this war , continues to occupy and support statelets outside of his borders and continues to harbour the posiners of salisbury etc relations are not returning to normal , russia is not a threat to the usa it doesn't have the capability . it is to europe . if killing the jew-nazi's or whatever it is they are trying to achieve in ukraine is successful it's moldova next then georgia then the baltic states then poland . we can see the propaganda on state tv the mask has slipped we know what you are about ."
3710,"i think so too . azov was definitely an uncomfortable thorn in kiev government's side . they were causing more bad pr than good , although publicly zelensky will praise them . it would be bad for him politically to disavow them . now he's rid of the problem ."
3711,"i didnt expect biden to fix everything in two years . but i am not going to sit here and listen to excuses . if he can steamroll things for ukraine , he can do so for things at home too . an effort would be appreciated . excuses can go fuck themselves ."
3712,are you still laughing to this day ?
3713,lmao all the other forums talk about is russian casualties if you were to believe resdit no ukranians have been killed in the war and russia has captured two major cities dude . kherson and mariupol . lyman has been taken and that other big city they are fighting now is in russian hands again
3714,as an american and descendant of slaves kidnapped and forced here i second this completely true .. the moment you speak against the status quo aka the truth you become a pariah without a doubt
3715,"that's a crazy comparison . you were free to criticize any war the us was involved in . russians aren't even allowed to acknowledge it as a war . people are being arrested for wearing the wrong color fingernail polish . i am free to say f google , apple , or any other corporation without losing my job , since i don't work for any of them . the us is far from perfect but they do have checks and balances that keep the sitting president from looting the country ."
3716,"lmao , go hold up a blank piece of paper in the red square then ."
3717,"it's not about the donbass . it's about crimea , nato ( nuclear security ), and like i said waiting meant ukraine would get stronger with time . zelensky would have been replaced with another us puppet . a country political stance is not decided by elections . they are decided by money , economic interests . and economic interest of everyone involved was to make war to russia in a few years , after the start of the next economic cycle . so putin chose now instead"
3718,many experts did say zelensky was ready to launch an invasion to take back the donbass and crimea . russian telegrams say that's what made the russians invade in the winter and couldn't wait for the summer . could be bullshit idk
3719,"since ww2 , the us has intervened/created god knows how many wars , can u list one of those that was "" legitimate "" and wasn't to further their interest ?"
3720,yaaawn . more whattaboutism and no sources for your claims .
3721,harbour the posiners of salisbury only the insane can believe in such stupid fakes .
3722,they set up another azov battalion in the east
3723,"> lmao all the other forums talk about is russian casualties well yeah , it's pro ukranian > if you were to believe resdit no ukranians have been killed in the war i see a ton of god speed this , rip that on those forums so if you've found one without them feel free to cross-post . the ones i know about all talk about the casualties , especially the civilian toll . > and russia has captured two major cities dude . kherson and mariupol . lyman has been taken yes i know . if you think they don't go tell them . i was just reading on a pro-ukranian sub about whether or not they should abandon the one they're currently fighting over . > and that other big city they are fighting now is in russian hands again i know ."
3724,"> am free to say f google , apple , or any other corporation without losing my job , since i don't work for any of them it's not a real criticism . you are also free to say fuck russia in russia . there are several subjects you can't mention on any us platform , or publicly in eu , and guess what , i won't mention them . the us has no check and balance , what the us has is securities so the country keep being ruled by corporations who loot the country's future through debt ( and foreign countries through interventionism ). you have no way out because it's locked as is , on purpose . that's what you call "" checks and balance "", your locks ."
3725,"the political stance of countries in europe has been swinging around wildly for some time now , i really dont think its as clear-cut as you seem to think it is , or that the us ( or anyone ) has as much control over the democratic process as you seem to believe . politics can very much be emotional , swing around . and economic interest of everyone involved was to make war to russia in a few years , after the start of the next economic cycle. i mean no , no it wasnt . the war is destroying the economy , definitely of ukraine , who will be in debt for decades to come , but also harshly hurting the economies of all of europe . i dont buy that argument . ukraine had applied ( and had been rejected ) for nato before . and i dont think that ukraine would have had the capability to invade crimea , if putin simply stationed more defenses there and kept it at that . such a potential war would have also been much harder to politically justify in the west , and wouldnt have resulted in as much military aid ."
3726,"as usual , many experts say and certainly telegram isnt a credible source . if thats what putin believed , the correct response is stationing further defensive military structures in crimea and near donbas and * keeping them there *. otherwise you just turn a possible large scale war into a guaranteed one ."
3727,"what is legitimate and to further their interest can coincide . korea , grenada , first iraq war , haiti , i consider fairly legitimate . the intervention in the yugoslav wars , while certainly a controversial topic , did have at least some legitimacy imo ."
3728,korea comes to mind . that was a blatant attack and invasion by the north . since then however the reasons for going to war have only gotten flimsier and flimsier .
3729,"have no fear we know exactly what went on . the crime was ignoring it because the money was rolling in to our bribed politicians , after the adventure in ukraine no amount of money will wash away the blood ."
3730,if you knew all this why did you post the opposite before in the previous post lol
3731,"wow , that is real tinfoil hat stuff . from what i've seen russian troops do to innocent civilians in the overrun territory i couldn't sleep at night supporting that . it's like gobbels trying to justify the occupation of chezkovlovakia and poland . ukraine was no threat to anyone else and there is zero excuse ."
3732,well at the end of the day . no one other than the kremlin or washington really knows
3733,only the insane can believe in such stupid fakes .
3734,i post what i think offers another perspective . i don't claim to know how much is truth . it's just showing you how the other side is reporting it .
3735,"i was not going to be the one guy who tells that all statements about russian troops killing innocent civilians are false , but fuck it , i'm going to be that guy . but seriously , there are so far no overwhelming evidence of russian troops atrocities , hell , i can say there is no evidence at all . all "" evidences "" they provide are either faked videos , like that one video of "" two russians shooting in the back civilians "", or again that "" bucha massacre "", which still is the strangest provocation ever done by ukraine ( mayor confirmed russian troops were outta the city , yet after several days bodies are noticed on the streets ; most of the bodies are with white armbands ( identification mark for russian troops or russia supporters ), that one video of ukrainians where the soldier says "" are we allowed to shoot people without blue armbands ?"" and the other replies with "" sure we are ""). in your replies however , you still missed the point of the guy you were replying to . he was trying to prove you that russian imperialism is better than usa's and pretty much he'd love to live in russia , and you reply with "" still russian troops kill civilians "". dude , i can definitely say that no russian would ever kill civilian on purpose . there is no point in doing that . i say that as a russian person . you wouldn't kill slav if you are a slav and that slav is neutral to you . there is no point to kill civilians aswell just because most russians are christians and try not to sin , killing people is the last thing a christian would do . heck , even atheists are morally ok in russia . doing crimes in war would get you in prison in russia . do i think ukrainians are killing civilians on purpose ? no , of course not . the only one here killing civilians here are either nationalists from "" azov "" and "" aidar "" ( for provocation against russia ), or regular soldiers who were obliged to do that by their command ( if they don't do that , they are simply killed ) ( again , for provocation ). they do everything the want against civilians , and nobody would investigate it . but civilians all remeber that ( tons of videos where civilians say what was done to them by ukrainian nationalists . then ukrainians would say it was done by russians and everyone would believe them , yet the real bombings of civilians with cluster bombs by ukrainians are simply forgotten after a day or later or they say that it was done by russians ( even when they are proven wrong because these rockets are used only by ukrainians ). why people don't see this ??? i'm not going to use that shitty word "" brainwashed "", but it really fits in ..."
3736,first learn how to write czechoslovakia
3737,"i also dont see the strategic interest for russia to attack if it was truly a matter of defending crimea . ukraine was poorly equipped for an offensive war ( their tanks , artillery , planes were all old ), crimea is easily defensible and generally , the defender has an advantage . further , the west would have been much , much more reluctant to provide aid for a ukrainian attack on crimea rather than the other way round . optics matter for the west , and yes , thats a much more difficult narrative to spin ; the 40b wouldve been much harder to get through the american public , and i genuinely dont see continental wester europe providing any military aid at all if zelensky was the one to declare it , neither the strict sanctions that are harming their own economies ."
3738,"why don't we see more use of smoke screens to protect fixed positions ? with forward observers replaced by drones , that have a limited flying time , it seems to me that smoke could be a reasonable tactic to use to hinder accurate fire on fixed positions . all the ground team need do is lay a ring of smoke generators and , as soon as the first incoming round is detected , set off the relevant smoke cover , allowing for wind etc . i'm a keyboard warrior only so have no idea what is/isn't practical . educate me please ."
3739,what is reddit's thoughts/predictions on the outcome of the situation regarding the two american pow in the dpr ?
3740,id like the war to end . let cancer takes care of putin .
3741,anyone offering military training ?
3742,"do we know if ukraine plans to reocccupy snake island ? i see the strategic value , huge , but it looks tough for either side to hold ."
3743,"my relatives in china think russia is kicking ass with its advanced weaponry . whats the best video compilation you guys know of ? turret tosses , nlaws and javelins at work especially because they think russian tanks kick ass ."
3744,what's up with this sub !? the vids don't go up and ppl are being banned and mod down because they are sharing dead russians !? was this sub conquererd by russkies that are modding down ops uploads !?
3745,does anybody know how lysyshanks situation is ? ive read that ruzzkies claim to have captured it
3746,"seems that the area under attack is rather large compared to the camouflage of the smoke . additionally , the smoke itself would draw attention and serve as a target ."
3747,russia murdering pows i think would only increase public support for the war .
3748,"i dont think the us public would respond in a way ru would like . if its one thing that can unite left , right , center is supporting vets . killing them and violating international law is a sure fire way to sow deep hatred and resolve vs russia . i might be giving ru some inside advice , but what ever you think youd accomplish its a really really bad move ."
3749,"the public trial with death sentences served two purposes , to show the own population that they defend russia from the evil nato nazi mercenaries by means of totally fair trials (/ s ). and also it serves as a deterrence for more volunteers , who are meant to think twice before joining the ukrainian foreign legion . so far , that is done , now they have prisoners , just killing them would be a bit helpful for the latter of above purposes , but keeping them alive as hostages gives them some material for negotiations or deals . so i think they will be imprisoned for an indefinite time and possibly exchanged at some time . similar to spies during the cold war ."

3751,"i doubt they would want to , since anyone on the island is basically a sitting duck with no place to hide . given russia's naval superiority , it doesn't make any sense to station troops there . they might do a quick landing for photo opportunities , but i don't see them putting a permanent garrison in place ."
3752,"maybe better to let them keep thinking that . then when they try for taiwan it will be that much more of a shock for them to be stopped in their tracks . complacency in china is a good thing for the west . the problem with showing them video evidence is that most people don't have the knowledge to know what they're looking at , and would just say they must be ukrainian tanks exploding !"
3753,"hiya , we abide by our subs policies , rules as well as our moderation guidelines . if you have any ( be it positive or negative ) feedback you can send our team a message and we will look into it . we will not go into details on these type comments . especially when you acuse us of these claims ."
3754,"plausible , however since they would already be under attack it would seem safe to assume their approximate position is no secret . i'd assume that smoke would , for example , hinder a drone's ability to determine the precise location . the dugouts still offer a lot of shelter from all but the very closest shells ."
3755,"see , this is what i was thinking . why would they kick the hornets nest and lose two valuable bargaining chips ? yet still i wonder if dpr soldiers will take this into their own hands . i also wonder who or what the us would exchange for those two pows"
3756,that's my thought too but i can also see the attraction of sticking harpoons on it to push the o\*c navy back 100 miles . as you say probably not viable due to the risk .
3757,"although if the original ukrainian garrison were released and got to go back it would be funny . "" not you lot again , what part of fuck off don't you understand "" lol"
3758,"sent about 8 videos all of them were seen by 20-30 ppl in the first few hours . zero comments , zero features ... it was like my approval rate was put behind a silence wall . it was a very strange pattern from the video rating before i don't know what you are talking about messaging the team . since the team just banned me without a reason , message or any other explanation . i was banned for 3 days i couldn't reach anyone through message and couldn't post/content any video any more ."
3759,"or you just do the very russian thing and just shell the smokescreen . they should be used to obscure the enemys vision , to cover a withdrawal and to enable maneuver . so dropping it on the russians would be the better play , they would then only have to rely on drones to have any form of vision , and in urban or wooded environments theres only so much something above can see ."
3760,"and look at that , they managed to not hit a mall full of people ."
3761,"notice how accurate this round was . contrast this to russian artillery . which wouldve taken six shots , maybe 10 ."
3762,one nice shot
3763,looks like second shot . theres a hole in the big warehouse at beginning . good intelligence to .
3764,"i'm so glad i'm in the uk , i'm so glad i am not an orc . i am so glad ukraine had the balls to stand up to this shiftiest of rapists and murders . peace ."
3765,damn that artillery is no joke
3766,there should be medals awarded for hits like this .
3767,take notes russian : small shell + big boom = ammo dump hit . big antiship missile + big boom = warcrime
3768,jiminy christmas ! what a shot !
3769,"burn it , burn it like that ! "
3770,ka-boom rico !
3771,that gave me 155 reasons to giggle like a schoolgirl .
3772,hell yeah ! thats what i like to see . total obliteration of orcs and ammo .
3773,"is there no way of adding on something to the shell so that it shoots out something that lights up the sky with the letters "" fu ru ""?"
3774,gps guided round ?
3775,"imagine that , they managed to hit a in the middle a smaller building ( aka the military target ) surrounded by other bigger buildings and and the ruskies hit everything around the target except the fucking military target ."
3776,0rkz do big-bada-boom !
3777,if it was ammunitions depot there would be secondary explosions . if its an empty ammo dump no secondary explosion .
3778,""" fuck yeaahhh biitch !"""
3779,thought the fly was a fly by warthog
3780,"ahhhhhhh , fuckin-a man . delayed fuse and everything ."
3781,nice . i soo hope russia are running out of ammunition . keep it up ukraine .
3782,"center mass , hell yeah"
3783,damn
3784,looks like fuel igniting .
3785,wow ! 
3786,"victor , where is the quartermaster . he is over there ivor .. and a few parts of him are over here ."
3787,russian soldier : great now we have to change with out ammo . ukrainian soldier : i wunder why they are not shooting back ? o well easy day for me .
3788,"with modern fired direction control and a trained fdc , the 777 is accurate up to 3 meters ( keep in mind that the standard 105mm he round has a 75meter effective casualty radius ). edit : 155mm . "
3789,wowzers that was a bollock tingling explosion ! very nice .
3790,that is what military target looks like
3791,holly cow ! what a hit !
3792,one shot elimination . no follow up needed .
3793,fuck that was some heavy shit .
3794,this is what heaven weapons are all about .
3795,very big boom ! 
3796,"god bless a free ukraine , her citizens and watch over her armed forces ."
3797,"sayonara , sucka ! "
3798,i found that kaboom deeply satisfying like a tall cold beer on a hot summer day .
3799,wow ! what-a-ba-boom !!! the blast went through the building beside it .
3800,t repeat..now in russland territory
3801,to rushists ammo . welcome to hell sukkaa
3802,lovely
3803,russia will claim that it housed a mall which was storing people .
3804,hollywood style boom
3805,"aw he fell down , [ go booom ]("
3806,"one shot , one kill . c . walken ."
3807,"special "" well now we are fucked "" operation . i'm sure the ruzzians will have * no problem * replacing those supplies ."
3808,"i know it was an awesome direct artillery hit on that orc ammo depot , but i so badly want to believe that they dropped a house fly 8 seconds into the video that created a massive ammo depot explosion !"
3809,i'd call those secondaries ....
3810,"holy shit , i didnt know m777 rounds are this powerful"
3811,"wow , that couldn't have been any more dead on ."
3812,is it just me or has a lot of ammo dumps been exploding since all this western arty has been delivered ?
3813,there's no secondary explosions which you would get if you hit an ammo dump . so it's not an ammo dump . when a building housing ammunition is bombed you always get secondaries .
3814,nice intel !
3815,it must be horrible having to blow up your own country to deny it from invaders . hope they take the war to ruzzian soil soon so they know how it feels ...
3816,thats a pretty good shot
3817,boom goes the dynamite
3818,i really was not expecting all that beauty !
3819,that's from an arty round ? almost looked like it detonated from the inside .
3820,now that is a thing of beauty !
3821,are we sure that wasnt a random volcano that blew up ? that honestly looks like a volcanic explosion . 
3822,a video of a longer video .. show us the real deal
3823,youre telling me that was one artillery shell ??? downvote for being impressed by the explosion ?? what a dick .
3824,** russia **: shelling hits building with 50 families inside .
3825,"russians have proven to the world that they just want ukraine , not ukranians"
3826,russia would have leveled every building around it and not damaged the one military target .
3827,"it does look like another building took a roof shot and it didn't blow . they knew the ammo was there somewhere , and eventually found the one . boom !"
3828,they did the math
3829,one well placed hit at a time is all it takes - ukraine vs . spray and pray - russia
3830,"hey man nice shot . nice shot , man ."
3831,"if that was one shot , whats 7 going to do ?....."
3832,0:01 no honey 0:11 jackpot
3833,"could be . many militaries use a strategy , where they "" knock on the roof "" first . so you send a round that doesn't explode so that people gtfo , and then the real stuff . i have no information if ukraine is using this strategy or not ."
3834,"there's very good reasons that artillery is called the king of battle . the biggest reason being that in both world wars artillery killed more people than any other weapon . or , as napolean said , "" god fights on the side with the best artillery. "
3835,its not the artillery its because theyve hit a munitions store .
3836,there are illumination rounds that kind of fit the bill . in mortars if you had a really tight fdc and gun line you could set the fuses slightly different to get them to pop at slightly different heights . not really a great use of resources but its * technically * possible . maybe once this is over and they can afford to burn some ordinance .
3837,that's what i thought - there's definitely something combustible there but there's no further explosions . it could just be heating oil for the nearby buildings or a civilian garage .
3838,"it could be their powder farm . that'd still qualify as an ammo dump , but without the michael bay explosions ."
3839,the 777 is 155mm and that accuracy is only with the excalibur round . the standard round m795 has a cep of 139 meters at max range . lowers with shorter range .
3840,"you do realize im not actually in the ukrainian military , right ? i just saw this vid online lol"
3841,one incoming shell but probably struck thousands of stored munitions hence the massive explosion
3842,because russia has never been able/willing to develop precision ammunition .
3843,and still miss the target
3844,""" russia would have damaged their own military & artillery depot """
3845,they dont go after military targets
3846,a filter reference in the wild
3847,pretty sure he is commenting on the accuracy
3848,propaganda works both ways
3849,"i am operationally familiar with the copperhead . like i said , 3 meter accuracy , up to 16km ( conventionally ) range . i misspoke when i wrote 105 instead of 155 , and my brothers would have my balls for that . ill admit the mistake in an edit ."
3850,i never asked lol . no reason to take it personal
3851,i understand that but there have been a lot of these videos of ammo dumps being hit and its usually a smaller explosion followed by ammo going off here and there . this seemed like everything literally went off all at once . im really wondering if this was some specialty munition for the m777 ?
3852,they do have laser guided shell but they rather use area bombing
3853,"they were precise , they want to obliterate any hint of ukrainian life they can . they're murderers , and they don't care ."
3854,russia targets civilians and military - very simple . it's illegal - but plainly that is what they do . it's not a matter of inaccuracy .
3855,"you don't need precision ammunition to be accurate , i was an artilleryman , we could land a regular he round on a car with a 777 from 10 miles away"
3856,they targeted the mall . as act of terror .
3857,i forgot about the copperhead !
3858,can confirm lol . no question mark detected
3859,"yeah i just mistook what you were saying , my bad"
3860,"valery legasov : "" why ; for the same reason our reactors do not have containment buildings around it , like those in the west . the same reason why we don't use properly enriched fuels in our cores . the same reason we are the only nation that builds water cooled , graphite moderated reactors , with a positive void coefficient ; it's cheaper """
3861,on paper does not count in a war
3862,too pricey . more yachts must be built . also orcs just don't fucking care .
3863,"i was about to say that . the systems they are using are actually increadibly accurate , within 5-7 meters . they just choose to aim them at malls and places where civilians coule be located ."
3864,i remember hearing copperhead rounds flying our heads working on our tank ( abrams ) and having a 1st sgt smash by in a hummer screaming at everyone to get their headgear on . copper heads really do have a lovely sound when you know they're on their way past you to fuck shit up . super accurate too .
3865,its just you can see the timeline is longer . i want the extended version with better quality : p
3866,"hes delusional , take him to the infirmary"
3867,not many people will understand the meaning of this comment . it's slightly terrifying .
3868,also russia : capitalism is bad
3869,"check out the new chernobyl doc on hbo that is all old footage , they didn't build containment because they didn't want anyone to think there was even the possibility of something bad happening . no one in the city ever thought they were ever in any danger , even after the explosion and before the evacuation ."
3870,what if it's a war of words ?
3871,b52's didn't exist during ww2 but i get your point nonetheless .
3872,right there with you brotha
3873,"i have no idea , but im deeply curious . i will be using the phrase void coefficient in my sci-fi novel im writing ."
3874,"a positive void coefficent is not a good thing to have in a nuclear reactor design . that's pretty much all you need to know but here are more details according to wikipedia . > a positive void coefficient means that the reactivity increases as the void content inside the reactor increases due to increased boiling or loss of coolant ; for example , if the coolant acts predominantly as neutron absorber . this positive void coefficient causes a positive feedback loop , starting with the first occurrence of steam bubbles . this can quickly boil all the coolant in the reactor , if not countered by an ( automatic ) control mechanism , or if said mechanism's response time is too slow . this happened in the rbmk reactor that was destroyed in the chernobyl disaster as the automatic control mechanism was mostly disabled ( and the operators were trying somewhat recklessly to rapidly restore a high power level . due to poor control rod design , the operators were unaware that there was a maximal level of neutron poison in the core )."
3875,"it's a quote from the mini series "" chernobyl "". it focuses on the why it happened and how the tragedy was handled afterwards . i'd say it's probably my favorite mini series , but it's really dark . don't listen to it if you're feeling down"
3876,"the term is also called the temperature coefficient of reactivity ( t ). basically a measurement of the change in reactivity rate based off of temperature change . most modern day reactors have a negative temperature coefficient which means that as temperature of the moderator ( water , liquid sodium , etc .) goes up , the reactivity of the core will decrease . a positive t results in reactivity increasing with an increase in temperature which was a major contributing factor during the chernobyl melt down ."
3877,i like dark stuff . where can i see it ?
3878,it was so surprisingly good .
3879,"it was brilliant television , but also very historically inaccurate . repeating a lot of contemporary anti nuclear propaganda that has proved to be untrue ."
3880,really great show . i've watched it twice
3881,"remember the moment after the explosion when civilians stayed under ' snowflakes '? terrifying feeling and it is based on a true episode , the bridge of death . you can google it if you want to know more ."
3882,fuckin yikes to that .
3883,"> a positive t results in reactivity increasing with an increase in temperature thats so weird . during the time , even in electronics people would be aware that higher temp contributes to faster degradation and they had to be cooled , same with motor mechanics , and even physics - that low temp reduces electron activity . why would higher temperature reduce activity - be it radioactive or physical properties ? most of things slow down in cooler temperatures , right ? or is it different with reactors ?"
3884,hbo
3885,buy it on google
3886,do you have some examples ? just curious
3887,"great question ! many nuclear reactors work by creating neutrons through nuclear fission . these neutrons interact with a moderator that flows through the core . by interact i mean they impart their energy on the molecules that make up the moderator . this heats up the moderator which can then be used to create steam in a steam generating system which can turn turbines to create electricity . this also results in more neutrons returning to interact with the fuel which causes more fissions and produces more high energy neutrons . if that doesn't make sense , think of it as the neutrons leaving the fuel , bouncing off of the water molecules , and going straight back into the fuel . i'm specifically describing the function of pressurized water reactors because that's what i have experience with . as the temperature of water changes , its density changes as well . if it heats up , it becomes less dense -> more space between the water molecules . this results in less neutrons imparting their energy on water molecules and less neutrons "" bouncing "" back into the fuel which results in fewer fissions . the vise versa is true with cold water . greater density means more neutrons returning to the fuel to cause more fissions resulting in an increase in reactivity . this makes reactors with a negative t "" inherently stable "" because a slight decrease in temp will cause an increase in reactivity . this will result in temperature increasing due to more fissions occurring and reactivity in turn decreasing . that's only during normal operations though . a rapid introduction of cold water could still result in an uncontrollable increase in reactivity and cold water casualties could still result in a core melt down if no automatic safety or operator action was taken . i'm not a nuclear physicist by any standard so i hope that makes sense ."
3888,huge respect to britain for this !! they dont give a crap about russias threats and thats the way it should be !
3889,the light gun is faster to set up and faster to pack up than the bigger guns . also the light gun has a higher rate of fire 2-3xs more than the big boys . more rounds on target before evading counter battery fire but obviously smaller shell but overall great system . i believe it can still outrange the common russian/ukraine(soviet ) 120mm howitzers .
3890,"the british , despite all criticism , have done a superb job during this war ."
3891,"at this point almost everyone weapon ever sent to ukraine has been described as a "" gamechanger "". the word doesn't carry much weight anymore ."
3892,"kiwis are training them , they will be good operators ."
3893,nzdf in the house !
3894,it's amazing how much is uk doing to support ua . would it be different without boris ?
3895,light guns are quick to transport and can put rounds on russians . they can also be used to free up larger guns . good for supporting advances as well .
3896,"this is great however id love to lend them the parachute regiment , the royal marines , the gurkhas and the sas / sbs for a few months ."
3897,american here . i love the brits !!!
3898,teach them well . they will make fabulous allies in nato
3899,"nine of these are really "" game changers "". without long range guided missiles they can't take out the russian ships . give them tools to get out the russian ships and that will be a game changer ."
3900,"this makes me think of star wars , the empire vs the alliance . except it's real and putin isn't nearly as cool as darth vader"
3901,"as an american , god bless ukraine ! slava ukraine !"
3902,is that gun relevant in this type of war ? i'm hoping someone with experience or knowledge can answer this .
3903,i love seeing grunts learn math !
3904,"i hate to say it ( youll know why if you served in us army/usmc ), but ( cannon/rocket ) artillery is king of battle for a reason ."
3905,is this salisbury plain ? because im there right now and would like to keep an eye/ear out for it
3906,"yes , supply those light guns , towed artillery , but many of them , many many of them ."
3907,ok ok . another game changer ! great . so when does the game actually start to change ?
3908,"we're running out of people , but , sure , give us some more weapons ."
3909,that's because we have quite a lot of submarines currently patrolling in the waters around russia loaded with many nuclear missiles ! if they want to play those games we're ready !
3910,"please don't forget the new zealand army royal artillery regiment . they are also there as the smes on the l119 , as it is our in-service gun ."
3911,"historically , threats and the possibility of having to fight have never frightened the brits ! "
3912,"> i believe it can still outrange the common russian/ukraine(soviet ) 120mm howitzers . you mean 122mm ? they don't use 120mm howitzers . their most common howitzer at 122mm is the d-30 , which has an effective range of 15.4km so no , the l119 does not outrange common soviet howitzers ."
3913,"its also perfect for soft targets like supply trucks , dismounted infantry , and soldiers in tranches ."
3914,what criticism ? theyve been like the no.2 ally of ukraine .
3915,the mlrs and the pzh 2000 are about the only things that have been called a gamechanger a lot iirc
3916,the equivalent of owen wilsons wow! 
3917,maybe it's the amount and quantity of external training rather then the weapons themselves .
3918,"ukraine has support uk wide it isnt split down party lines . considering how split we are on nearly everything these days its good to see the us united in that regard . i believe we will continue to support ukraine with weapons , military intelligence and humanitarian aid for as long as it takes ."
3919,putin fucked with the uk one too many times . i think deploying chemical weapons in salisbury was the final straw . the novichok clean up bill was 20-30 mil last time i read .
3920,for sure if jeremy corbyn won the last election he would of sent weapons to russia .
3921,"cool idea , but even highly-trained meatbags aren't much good in artillery exchanges ."
3922,16 air assault be good !!
3923,"they have harpoons available , but have not employed many so far ."
3924,"russia ships have moved out of firing range of the coast , they have already been given harpoon missiles for this but they are not compatible with soviet aircraft and the ukrainians don't have many navy ships left and none that could be retrofitted for use with the harpoon so russian ships are out of reach at the moment ."
3925,yes . guns are generally useful in most wars
3926,yes mid range fire and run weapons like these are very important in this war . there is a lot of back and forth of giving ground and taking it back in quick succession .
3927,"of course they are , they are lighter and can be moved by lighter vehicles meaning that can be packed up and moved much easier and brought closer to the fight to put rounds down range faster and moved quickly to avoid counter artillery fire . guns must be moved shortly after firing a salvo because counter artillery radar will pass coordinates to enemy artillery who will bombard that location . having a lighter gun that's that task much easier ."
3928,let ruzzia fuck around and find out . i do not think our gb friends have forgotten some of the liberties putin has taken on british soil .
3929,"> that's because we have quite a lot of submarines currently patrolling in the waters around russia probably no more than 2 . we "" only "" have 4 in total and i think the idea is that they rotate between deployment/maintenance/standby . doesn't really matter though because one is enough to seriously fuck russia up ."
3930,indeed there's also some new zealand personnel no doubt offering some vital help with the training as the british don't field this gun anymore .
3931,"yes the 122 , the 105 with the advanced rocket assisted shells outrange the 122 . but not sure if the ukrainians will get those . 19.5 km with rocket assist , 14 km normal . d30 has 15ish km range ."
3932,"well that's incorrect , the russian 2b16 nona also known as the nona-k is a 120mm howitzer . they also have multiple truck platforms that carry various 120mm artillery that they often refer to as self propelled mortars but that's artillery ."
3933,no.1 ally . the us has given more at this point but the british gave the ukrainians weapons before the war started without which the outlook would likely be very very different to what it is now and they have been pressing other european nations and the us to start giving them weapons and to keep giving them . no one has done more in this regard than the british . probably still quite pissed off about putin ordering assassinations on british soil .
3934,but britain has some hostory before this war and even during this war there is at the very least one ( 1 ) more focus point for the bri'ish govt . so criticism might be in regards to one of those points ?
3935,plus it helps that boris always needs to take attention off one of his many fuck ups .
3936,same here in the us ( except for the extreme right magas who get fed russian propaganda all day and the extreme left communists who idolize lenin )
3937,remember 6/7 years ago putin flew a bomber up the english channel risking civilian lives ?... i would engage it now if it ever happens again ! 
3938,"he's a wooly headed peacenik . he would have sent thoughts and prayers to ukraine . i expect starmer would have responded much the same as johnson , he's a centrist in the tony blair mould ."
3939,"we aussies have a real gratitude for our new zealand artie brothers , memories of battle at long tan vietnam ."
3940,"> 19.5 km with rocket assist , 14 km normal . the british l119 have 11km range"
3941,that's hardly a howitzer per western standards
3942,not to mention the efforts of british intelligence in passing intelligence over to the ukrainians . its not often mentioned but they have some of the best intelligence services in the world and they have 100 % been brought to bear against russia in this conflict .
3943,"not to say that britain isnt doing any good because theyve been great but them being number one is simply false . weve given more and are going to give more , its simply not comparable . we had more troops there training them and everything . and we were also sending them arms before the war , so thats not a uniquely british policy ."
3944,"im a little confused . what history ? do you mean their imperialist history ? recent shit like some criticism of borris ? becusse theyve been helping ukriane since 2015 , training and arming them . sending economic and humanitarian aid . and now sending lots of heavy equipment and training troops like we see here . whatever criticisms there are of the uk they dont belong here unless its something to do with this war ."
3945,i thought the briish thing was a joke about the accent . do you just hate british people when you type it like that ? is it a slur now ?
3946,"boris has been a total disaster in his domestic policy , so he can indulge his churchill complex fully with a foreign war . boris is doing the right thing but for purely selfish reasons . dont forget he dumped his wife of many years as soon as she was diagnosed with cancer "
3947,"what do you mean up the english channel ? the english channel is a massive body of water not a river and it's also international waters . no russian bomber has ever entered british airspace otherwise it would be shot down , as long as russian aircraft remain outside it then they can waste all the fuel they want . those archaic aircraft aren't intimidating at all ."
3948,"too bad , the american 105 has 14km range and 19.5km with rocket assist"
3949,"from wikipedia : "" 17,200 m ( 18,800 yd ) 20,600 m ( 22,500 yd ) extended range using base bleed """
3950,"absolutely not ? who will come if needed poles and brits 100 %, nothing but absolute respect in regards to ukraine and this war . not such a stelar performance in other fields . do you hail fuhrer every day just because you have 88 in your name ? but this bri'ish thing i never saw as a slur , if you are indeed from uk and feel offended - sure i won't say it again . but does a cheeky joke about an accent really hit that deep ?"
3951," the english expression "" up "" means travelling north "" up "" the english channel .. the youtube link to this historical channel may better explain that the real putins russia has become the aggressor for many years . the propaganda from russia telling the world that the west is an aggressor is historically incorrect .. recently no fighter jets have been scrambled around the british coast because tensions are on alert ... take note of the british instructions given the raf .. have a nice day ! "
3952,that's the l118 .
3953,"i'm british mate . no it's not in the slightest offensive as far as i'm concerned and i'm sure many other brits would agree . and yeah , we've got issues both recently and in history much like many many other countries around the world . so yeah , it's a meh from me , couldn't care less , ha ha you do you"
3954,"as a bri'ish individual , i can assure you we are not offended by it . consider this your loicense to use ' bri'ish ' whenever you want ."
3955,"i typed briish a lot too and thought it was a funny meme . but recently ive seen posts where people hate the british or are on subs where its a karma farm to hate on them . so im wondering if its s thing now where they cant bring themselves to type british as an odd sign of disrespect . i could be wrong , but keep your eye out as i do think its becoming a thing "
3956,"its cause americans type like that when taking the piss out of an english accent , its not offensive but might give wrong impression"
3957,im just saying its something ive noticed more and more . its like saying they dont want to type british . ive seen it in the worst and hateful comments
3958,well unfortunately i and my bubble are in a circle-jerk of loving anyone who smacks russia about . so have not noticed this being used in any malicious way but sure thing . will be more aware of it !
3959,where do you hang out that you've seen this ?
3960,"that's fair . didn't realise that was a thing . hate all they want , most of it is usually propaganda driven anyway ."
3961,"hey , if there's one thing uniting large numbers of people from many countries right now . it's for a deep seated hatred of russia and everything it stands for . nothing wrong with that . i think it's a very fucking big circle-jerk"
3962,the most well equipped russians i've seen yet .
3963,"now walk back across the border , orcs . "
3964,"this ( and also [ this ]( is actually a good advertisement for the tigr vehicle , it seems to protect the crew better than most other crap that russia has , and on par with a modern mrap from other countries : doors can still open after the hit , they are not jammed , and the crew can survive and get out . that is exactly what you should expect from a vehicle of this class ."
3965,i've seen probably a half dozen mraps get blown up by soviet anti tank mines in iraq . every single dude got out without anything more than a bell ringing . its impressive how vehicles made to resist mines will take it compared to traditional low flat bottom vehicles .
3966,that'll buff right out .
3967,what is mmm marking and number 91 ?
3968,he won the orc lottery
3969,lived to die another day
3970,"well , they're walking now aren't they ? mine did its job ."
3971,"keep giggling , motherfucker . we all know where you are going to end up . your funeral wreath is waiting for you in shitheadistan"
3972,they're walking around in the woods as though that is the only mine in the forest .
3973,"full combat gear , but no red/white marker anywhere ? not doubting , just confused ."
3974,"ivan boss , the check engine light is on ... truck is broken . what we do now ?"
3975,i assume they arent bothered about ap mines then . they seem to be full of adrenaline after that experience .
3976,this is why the german tripwire mines are desired .
3977,any idea when/where this was ?
3978,blew the entire front to shit ive seen humvees take full blasts and still run no problem and those things are considered garbage in the west by now .
3979,"hmm , looks like a reference to the 3m duct tape they will need to fix it . or maybe what was holding it together in the first place ."
3980,without that engine to block the blast y'all woulda been paste . next time won't be so lucky on foot .
3981,lol imagine being russian and giving up the lives of thousands and thousands of people just to win some dirt and call it a victory thats literally embarrassing
3982,"mines aren't necessarily ment to kill the people inside , just destroy their vehicle ."
3983,sounds like a dud to me
3984,hope the orks got some sharpnel
3985,"fuck putin and fuck his sad orc followers , slava ukraini"
3986,he's laughing but he's just going to end up in a freezer cart and ukraine or getting eaten stray ukrainian dogs
3987,"yeah pose near a smoking vehicle , no chance sombody notice it from a far and strikes you"
3988,i need to see more videos of russians blown to bits to brighten my day .
3989,"i would be worried if i was them of more mines set within that same radius , just for that reason . so when they get out they step on one not made for heavy armored vehicles ."
3990,they seem pretty happy that they almost got blown up .
3991,a napalm spray should be included in the design
3992,"the grinny smile of the orc will fade away as soon they get picked off , one by one slava ukraini !!! "
3993,shame those pigs made it out alive .
3994,i'm going to have to find a source for russian military uniforms . looks like they have them in my size .
3995,"from now on the ukrainians bury two mines , one on top of the other.....then the orc-dick will be laughing out of his arse - literally ."
3996,fat russians ! is that a thing !
3997,i still admire the survivors .
3998,filmed on russia potato camera .
3999,catch you next time orcs .
4000,all things being equal those tigr's appear to be pretty decent trucks .
4001,is this a ruskie tigr or a ukaine captured tigr that was destroyed !?
4002,some kind of vip ? hope they could make pow's them at least
4003,"this may be a propaganda piece ,"
4004,> i've seen what you've seen is controlled
4005,then you no nothing about this war 
4006,"mine detected successfully , comrades ! great success"
4007,and take your broken shit with you .
4008,"uhhh , lets see how they fare on side impact ."
4009,you have to admire the crew survivability . got to be good for sales .
4010,"unfortunately not . the front fell off . must've been made of cardboard , dunno ..."
4011,"i don't know . this vid leads to a lot of questions . including all the men coming out of the woods . they appear organised . in contrast to the usual videos we see . it appeared in a telegram channel , as marked on the video yesterday but no real info with it ."
4012, may have something to do with this ponzi scheme 91 likely referrs to the year the ussr was dissolved .
4013,"yep , hopefully usher them towards some anti-personnel mines ."
4014,"yup , and hopefully they got at least fucked mentally and will get ptsd"
4015,why are you so excited about death ? these are humans you are talking about for christ's sake .
4016,they giggling with all the territories they gained . more giggling will come in the coming months .
4017,"mines are designed to be triggered by an heavy weight ( excepted for antipersonnal shit designed to grind children legs ). so i think that they could trip all around and organize their famous ' annual biffle festival ' with all their mofos , not accountering any problem"
4018,wagner most likely . can't wear state colors for reasons .
4019,"yea , theyre having a major count my fingers and toes and smile moment . this is one of the few stories theyll tell their grandchildren ."
4020,no idea on this one i'm afraid . uploaded to the channel yesterday . edit : found a location but still don't know what or who they are . lugansk area so lnr forces maybe .
4021,"vehicle did it's job , it's no different then when an mrap hits an ied , it's there to make the people inside not reach 0hp"
4022,"men calls ukraine land what biden loves so , only dirt"
4023,"adrenaline , imagine your russian or a proxy fighter , and your equipment actually does it's job , rare occurrence for sure"
4024,cry
4025,you obviously haven't seen their pilots then .
4026,because they are invading a foreign country ?
4027,a thoughtcrime . ministry of truth released the post with clear instructions what to admire here .
4028,minimal info . but the russian site it was on was happy and i checked for other posts and found it on a ukrainian site which was sad that only the vehicle was taken out of the fight . and that it was lugansk .
4029,oh yeah by who ? which boogy man controls the thousands of different news outlets ? which western government imprisons people for saying something contrary ? the only media being controlled here is russian media cause the government is too cowardly to allow freedom of the press .
4030,kys
4031,"these guys are literally wearing several tens of thousands of dollars worth of kit . they are not the bulk of ru forces . these guys are wagner , vdv or some other spec . ops unit with the amount of western gear they are using ."
4032,"i won't correct your grammar as that is petty , but if we're being real here ....... mostly we see videos of dead lpr and dpr soldiers or far eastern conscripts the russians use as cannon fodder . the clothes barely fit and they have no protection worth a damn of any kind . i was being a bit facetious as ive see some decked out chechen's and special forces , but those are few are far and usually associated with propaganda videos ."
4033,orc logic : one less mine comrade . mission success !
4034,that goes for any mrap
4035,this post is about mines .
4036,not a lot of side impact mines out there .
4037,found a location but still don't know what or who they are . lugansk area so lnr forces maybe
4038,"those are terrorists . mass murderers of a terrorist state who has commited literally every war crime that exists . so even though they are human beings , they deserve what terrorists deserve ( both morally and - in many countries - by law ): death ."
4039,"humans with inhumane intentions in their hearts don't deserve respect or pity they lost that right as soon as they invaded ukraine and began killing thousands of innocent civilians and behaving like savages . remember the horrors inflicted on countless innocent civilians in mariupol , bucha , irpin , kharkiv etc by soldiers just like these ? because that's what awaits the rest of ukraine if the russian army is not stopped . sadly this mine failed to stop this bunch of jokers ."
4040,"aww , sad to see your terrorist buddies having a bad time?why don't you go over and help them ?"
4041,"careful , theyll call you a russian bot for having any compassion whatsoever . remember : war is a concept reserved for the internet to most folks here ."
4042,negative theyre orcs not humans
4043,lol imagine giving up the lives of thousands and thousands of people just to win some dirt and call it a victory thats literally embarrassing
4044,"giggling all the way into hiding the casualties of the war from its own citizens , leaving their dead comrades rotting in ukraine , economic sanctions and isolation , increased restrictions and surveillance of its own citizens , yeah russia really is living the dream under putin . i'm sure it's a great country to have aspirations in ."
4045,i see you can not cope with how bad russia is doing . it's only going to get harder for you .
4046,a fun and not exactly new tactic to make minefields is mixing in a bunch of both anti-tank and anti-personnel mines .
4047,except they'll probably buy one next time ...
4048,what the fuck is this some kind of russian haiku ?
4049,i deserve to be in jail .
4050,freedom of choice in the end . i put that as the title because i wanted it to focus on the vehicle and the damage not the well armed to invaders who deserve no sympathy .
4051,ok so these are the ruskies that first got there . ukrainis run away safly i hope . since doors are open and no dead bodies around .
4052,xd
4053,""" western gear "" like what , as if china doesnt have good military gear now that they make or even russia has good stuff they make"
4054,thats why they liberated lyschansk from ukraines ?
4055,quite a few side-impact ieds with explosively-formed penetrators were used in iraq .
4056,"the only 91st i can find is 91st kelets command brigade , samara , part of 2nd combined arms . may be nothing to with it though ."
4057,i could not care less what these people think of me lmao
4058,"dont worry . thousnds of ukronazis were also fked . ukraine has always been dirt not just as a country , but also its government so theres no need to be embarassed . these dirt will only be under a new management that will have better infrastructure , higher , pension for its citizens , more jobs and opportunities , and a govt that will protect them . after all , ukraine has been the most corrupt country in europe for decades people temd to forget ."
4059,lmao . remind me in 5 months . maybe ukraine will be able to take 1 acre of land back?
4060,oh .. smart and cute .
4061,"they're still humans , don't forget this ."
4062,no i think the ukrainians were sad that no russians were killed so i'm assuming it a russian vehicle
4063,liberated ? lol . interesting use of words . they took control of lyscychansk because they have far more firepower and we're about to cut off supply routes away from the town itself . that has little to do with the equipment of each individual soldier .
4064,"ied with explosive penetrators ? the i means "" improvised ,"" doesn't it ?"
4065,"oke maybe ukraine is corrupt ( your words ) but if its true what you saying about management change , ukraine gots a same corruption level as russia . thats must be a insane level , western standards are much beter . hahaha what a comedian !! russian infrastructure , jobs and opportunities are joke compares with europe standards "
4066,haha you're telling me russia is less corrupt ? oh man you're drinking their kool aid bit time .
4067,"russia is objectively by every measure one of the worst countries in the world . the shittiest standards of living for the majority of its citizens ( hospitals , schools , roads and other infrastructure , food , justice system etc .), except for a very select few who live like kings and rule over the poor . corruption is absolutely everywhere . it's literally a feudalistic system where > 90 % of the people are slaves with no hope of ever becoming free . it's all a huge piece of garbage . ukraine is one step better off and recently started to actively improve and become a civilized , modern , european country with a strong and free middle class , decreasing corruption and improving standards of living . that is why russians are so envious of ukraine . they hate that the ukrainians are now living better than them . so that is why they have decided to destroy ukraine and drag it down to their own level , or even beyond . and destroy the ukrainan culture , language and nation as well , because those remind them to the fact that their country is inferior to ukraine . i think russia will not succed in destroying ukraine . on the contrary . russia will get destroyed and dismantled even more , like the soviet union was . they have been doing the same thing to other nations that they are doing to ukraine now ( e.g . tatars , chechens etc .), they have been occupying and oppressing these nations . hopefully they will become free and get their own countries as well ."
4068,"because russia has done so well with the last 5 months right ? not sure what the bigger joke is , the russian military , or you ?"
4069,i know . i won't cheer for their credo however .
4070,"ik theyre still winning and many russian soldiers have better equipment than ukraine farmers , intresting choice of words"
4071,and now the eu are in a crisis while russian ruble is rising .
4072,neither . its zelensky the clown and ukraine . also this whole subreddit .
4073,you're putting words in my mouth in both replies . i'm not sure what you're picking at . the average ukrainian soldier is better equipped then the average russian soldier .
4074,"lol google whats happens with currencys who rising fast something with a recession ?! the russian government pushes the ruble till the government is bankrupt sanctions effects ca . 5 % off russian export at the same time they effects 35 % off russian import off course the ruble rise in value because the russian can spend less rubles out off russia , so more ruble holds in there pockets .. more export - less import = higher value currency ( thats a easy explanation , even not a good sign ) its became a big bubble , when europe set more oil import from russian on hold end off this year the ruble claps in a very big downtrend what the russian government cant stop .. so ive got a tip for you my russian friend : now its the time too buy a lot cheap stuff from china . so next year you can buy a lot of breads with your chinees stuff and by the way : its dont feels like a crisis ( in the netherlands ). ukraine is in a crisis"
4075,you do realize it takes two seconds to check the charts rights ?
4076,thats why they lose and have far less firepower
4077,"they're not one in the same . what are you arguing ? russia having way more artillery , tanks , missiles , etc has nothing to do with what i'm saying ."
4078,this will not end until putin and his entire power structure is eliminated .
4079,hes aiming for stalins holodomor record ?
4080,"putin grows up on orthodox readings : hey , these four horsemen are great , i want to be them! "
4081,he is a student of stalin after all . stalin starved ukraine before and since now world supports ukraine putler is going to starve the world .
4082,"i'm more surprised by the fact that people are still surprised by this . it has been proved time & time again that you can't reason with dictators , they don't care about anything but themselves and their image . they don't have any empathy for anyone . just look at the ( approved by putin ) action of lukachenko . he actively urged immigrants from north africa to come to belarus , promising access to the eu , knowing full well that poland wouldn't let them cross the border . thousands of people trapped , not allowed to enter poland nor to go back into belarus . and on top of that , lukachenko actively blocked humanitarian aid . all these people were used as pawns to hurt the eu , because they put sanctions on belarus because of his treatment of political opponents . seriously , the people like scholtz and macron who are still trying to reason with putin or trying to appeal to his empathy are so delusional . the only thing these people understand is brute force ."
4083,"1 ) invade ukraine 2 ) start losing 3 ) don't worry guys , i have a plan ... 4 ) starve the developing world 5 ) continue losing in ukraine 6 ) what ??? i really thought starving the developing world would help 7 ) tell poland they're next 8 ) why everyone hate poor poor russia ?"
4084,it's the russian way after all .
4085,"so the invasion has been a total clusterfuck for the russians so far , pretty much nothing going as planned but yeah sure , putin is still playing some 16d chess that is somehow still on track since he can predict the future . i wonder when intellectuals will stop giving him so much credit . probably when he finally bites a bullet ."
4086,well much of the civilized world should send their military to stop him so .
4087,putin doesnt have the power that he thinks he has . in much the same way he doesnt have the army that he thought he had .
4088,and yet africans seem to be overwhelmingly positive towards russia ! 
4089,the sad thing is they are going still love putin and are going to blame the west for it . most african countries support russia ...
4090,"but if he wins , who says the starving will stop ? all the more reason to stop him ."
4091,"again , this will seriously backfire on putin ."
4092,that isnt going to make him win . its going to piss off the entire world for decades to come .
4093,"you need more than 10 times the grain and soy to feed animals for meat than if you just ate the grain and soy yourself . just eat less meat . whats ukraine worth to you ? if not subsidized even more ( read : socialism ), the price will soar soon anyways ."
4094,go cancer go ! kick putin's a__ . metastasize metastasize way back ! ( didn't think i'd ever be rooting for cancer . )
4095,western nations need to get involved ; i am in the us and dont care about the repercussions of going toe-to-toe with russia .
4096,holomodor
4097,"if america would stop putting corn in their gas tanks , the problem would be solved . about half of american corn is brewed into ethanol ."
4098,starve much of the developing world ' ... so the volunteers from developing countries will form some serious army units soon ?
4099,/ s so that's what he's been doing this past weeks by specifically targeting food/animal grain depot and fields ! i assumed they were just really bad at aiming ! / s
4100,how would that result in him winning ? wouldn't it erode support in one of the regions where russia has some degree of symapthy ?
4101,"time to step up to the plate , and destroy the russian ability to project power to the grain export ports or else millions will starve ."
4102,"i don't understand why the un can't agree the actions needed for food security . is it because it relies on a security council resolution ? clear the mines from the shipping lanes and provide a multilateral force to protect all food transports to and from odessa . and an attack on one is an attack on all . it's a ridiculously stupid world , us humans are just an evil species . we need a klaatu"
4103,hunger makes people do some crazy shit . this could ( probably will ) backfire on him .
4104,"just finish him off for fuck sake . 7 billion people , nearing 8 and not one person can end it ???"
4105,so the russian plan is to starve 3rd world countries already politically aligned with them and china ? that sounds more like a benefit to the west than a problem .
4106,the west needs to end this hard fast and quick . no more hesitation by western europe . full mobilization in terms of weapons production specifically for ukraine .
4107,how does someone continue to be so evil and nobody has had the balls to kill him to stop the tyranny ?
4108,we ( nato ) should eliminate any russian naval blockades .
4109,putin is a terrorist the worst world has ever seen
4110,trump empowered putin by calling him genius and savvy .
4111,how anyone in the world ever expected anything more from putler is beyond me . after he murdered tens of thousands in chechnya the european bankers dressed him up like some kind of clever statesman who could be trusted all so they could do business with him and his oligarchs . banking fees are that good ! german bankers and their client politicians are at the center of this . their criminal participation in this scheme should not escape notice .
4112,then the clown midget of france will come in and say : just give him some land already ! gosh i am so cool and smart leader !
4113,can someone just launch a nuke on putin already ? that man deserves it .
4114,"now hard is it going to be for the us and other countries to increase ag production and offset this issue ? we have capacity , no ? it takes a full year minimum to mobilize i would think ?"
4115,set up a mcdonalds
4116,"on his part , this is indeed a logical move . this is beneficial even for propaganda . they are not going to unblock our ukrainian ports now . but where all this is leading to ? i'm really scared ."
4117,my 7/15 calls on weat havent been doing well though . i guess i was too early 
4118,putin destroys all
4119,"he's really a very bad strategist : for now , the only countries really dependent on russian wheat are middle-east and north-african countries . who are mainly "" non-alligned "" or even "" pro-russian "" because of their dependencies . now , putin is preparing these countries to switch from russia to another country and , thus , revoking the last way of influencing them ."
4120,why is merkel not in prison as we speak ?
4121,"this crisis brought to you ( very carefully , over a long timeline ) by : america ! ( neat , huh )"
4122,"to be honest , i don't think any first world nation would care about this as a consequence of a war they were fighting ."
4123,please do ! promise you well demonstrate in our streets to just force our governments to declare russia war way before any sanctions are lifted
4124,"and again , the west is only concerned with buuuh escalation and dragging their feet . history wont be kind to the overall sluggish response . if this is a game of blockus , putin is definitely winning ."
4125,"because those in power will not starve , they will continue to suck the teet or russia . their people are the ones who will suffer ."
4126,$$$$
4127,"because their governments are after the type of power structure of russia ; allowed and encouraged corruption , suppression of any opposition , nepotism , favoritism , militarism , flag-waving insane patriotism , poor education , poor prospects to abandon poverty and restricted freedoms of thought , speech and action . governments of developing nations are after it . mexico , most of latin america , the african worldnothing is more enticing for the ruling class than being able to rape , suppress and loot their ignorant populations whilst such populations wave and enjoy the rape like the russians do ."
4128,saddest part of this whole thing is how ( feminine ) the whole response of the developed europe .
4129,"developing world isn't alligned one way or another , they care as much as say an ordinary ukrainian cared about what was happening to a palestinian or an iraqi getting bombed . developing world has been bombed and back several times by the side opposing russians . also , developing world continues to buy discounted oil and wheat from russia . it's the west that has prohibited itself from buying russian oil and wheat ."
4130,what intellectuals are still giving him credit ?
4131,he has nothing to lose ... he's dying and he doesnt care about anyone ... he wants to go out with a big bang
4132,everyone has kink of their own
4133,the soviets backed liberation movements in colonial africa during the cold war . russia and china have much better relations and deeper economic ties with most of africa than europe or north america .
4134,a lot of americans still support trump too . it's a thing of education and education is even worse in developping countries ...
4135,not if russian propaganda convinced lots of people the shortages are the fault of the west
4136,"exactly this , i don't understand why everyone is so excessively kind and tolerate to these awful people"
4137,"says someone not in the military , and without any idea of the actual repercussions of going to war with another nation of that size . you do understand that in a fight of that size , gloves come off and it gets much dirtier than anything youve seen in this conflict thus far . nuclear considerations aside , which literally prevent a conflict of that size . you need to stop being so emotional and use your head kid ."
4138,america needs to stop paying farmers to not plant crops in the name of price supports or the environment . right now the american farmers should be going all out to get as much growing as possible .
4139,america is the largest food exporter in the world even with turning corn into gas .
4140,"everyone ( not just one person , political party , or country ) who failed to respond to putins aggression may have helped embolden him to believe he could do this with limited repercussions ."
4141,"enough about trump , lets talk about trump "
4142,"russia invaded ukraine before trump took office , and then after he left never during . it's really fucking stupid to blame trump for this ."
4143,"not hard at all . only requires the us ( and much of europe , to that effect ) to grow food for human fucking beings for once , instead of filling all their fields with useless corn to feed the cows ."
4144,the us is in the grip of a drought in areas .
4145,"> translation , provided by google : how to make friends and influence people ."
4146,its ironic how much support putin gets from africans on social media . i've crossed keyboards with dozens of nigerians for example who think putin is great . idiots .
4147,can it handle a massive wave of refugees from starving african countries though ? feels like thats what putin is hoping for to destabilize europe
4148,"i dont think you live in western europe right now if youre saying something as ignorant as that . you clearly dont understand how natural gas prices , petrol prices , and food prices have already affected people . if food goes up 5x everyone in europe would be unable to afford anything outside of necessities . no english classes or sports for kids after school , no college funds , no discretionary income at all . theyd be struggling ."
4149,"declare a holy abrahamic war against russia . jews , muslims and christians fighting in a joint jihad/crusade to free the food their people need . / s"
4150,"ah yes , the only time the west has had a just cause to fight for in 80 years , we cower and expect weaker nations to do the hard work . let's bomb the poor nations after they defeat russia ! we're among the baddies , really ."
4151,"not even close , 90 % of people are already on a budget even if they don't know it yet ."
4152,delusan you goof .
4153,they might be more sustainable with a one child policy like china
4154,"i agree with this take . i believe that being in iraq and afghanistan have soured the west on war . we should be helping ukraine right now , boots and planes , win this war . history will judge us as having dragged our feet when we needed to be running forward ."
4155,"what's masculine ? cheering on the butcher ? i mean , i suppose we could get to that again , but everyone whined a great deal when we were first into just ( in a masculine way ) enslaving everyone , and the ( even more masculine i suppose ) attempt to hardcore genocide lesser races got on the way , people seemed to like it even less . is that what you'd like to see or what's up here ?"
4156,but he doesnt have the power .
4157,"i have a high opinion of europeans in most regards . one of the only areas my opinion of most european nations is low ( some exceptions here , uk and some former soviet nations ), is their inability to defend europe as a whole and to share in the suffering to have stability . im not taking about participation in moronic wars like iraq ; i am talking about confronting russia when they invade georgia or ukrainian . nato did well to intervene in former yugoslavia and in yugoslavian wars that followed ; id argue that europe benefited from them . but to not see the advantages of snuffing out modern day eurasian imperialism is dangerous . it sends a message to all expansionary nations that europe will tolerate it . russia isnt wwi or ii germany ; just because you push them out of ukraine or georgia doesnt mean you need to humiliate them after the deed is done . europe can pressure them to reform their government once putin is gone and help them recover financially after the deed of liberating ukraine is done . i think the west should do this ; russia and others needs to know that europe and the west arent joking around.and that we are interested in a true partnership if nations can respect the borders of peaceful neighboring states ."
4158,nuclear weapons is the only reason .
4159,no one wants their cities leveled and russia has proven they will do that
4160,"i was in the military for 8 years ; my grandparents , parents , most my uncles , and my wife were also in the military and most saw combat . im also a 43 year old well educated and successful man with 2 kids . russia cant justify nuclear war if their troops are pushed back to its borders after wrongfully invading peaceful neighboring nations . if russia does respond with nuclear war ( they wont ) to being booted from the counties they invaded , russia will never exist again as the world goes on . based on russias military performance thus far , their military wont be able to project their force like you fear it will ."
4161,"> you do understand that in a fight of that size , gloves come off and it gets much dirtier than anything youve seen in this conflict thus far . this is an argument , but it's an argument on both sides . clearly russia aims to be able to project that kind of power but currently is unable to . most of their ["" wunderwaffe ""]( as we like to call them in europe are research projects and only have one or two prototypes . what happens if we manage to set up a treaty which for peace which gives russia control of parts of ukraine and the massive increase in oil and gas prices and control of the grain market that comes with that and then wait 15 years ? in that case you will have the same conflict , but suddenly many of the things that are now bullshit propaganda will have become real . edit 1 : fix broken second paragraph edit 2 : completely the wrong phrase got cut and pasted ( fancy pants broken ) fix ."
4162,"it is possible that putin felt empowered ( though emboldened fits better ) by the lack of unity on display , which trumps words could be taken as an example of . otoh , ' trump derangement syndrome ' is entirely made up and mostly used as an ad hominem to dismiss criticism ."
4163,wow i noticed something similar ... interesting that so many fascist supporters online claim to be from nigeria . wonder whats going on over there .
4164,large russian propaganda campaign aimed at these regions reinforces anti-west opinions . seems to work to a decent extent .
4165,being malnourished and traveling long distances don't typically go well together .
4166,"> no english classes or sports for kids after school , no college funds , no discretionary income at all . awww ! well , maybe this will bring more attention to ww3 that's about to unravel ? people seem to be living in their own version of reality ."
4167,yes...but necessities isn't starvation . and almost all europeans can eat less expensive food than we eat today .
4168,"im in western europe and most people in western europe dont specifically pay for english classes lol , theyre either native speakers or mostly at a similar level by the time theyre done with education"
4169,"> ah yes , the only time the west has had a just cause to fight for in 80 years , we cower and expect weaker nations to do the hard work . where are most of the volunteers coming from ? zimbabwe ? north korea ? oh no . it's the west . sure , some people are coming from brazil , columbia and so on . these are people who have seen the support of the west and know the risk of the "" help "" that comes from russia and the torture it brings . most of the "" weaker nations "" however are not even doing the little that they could and should be doing . > let's bomb the poor nations after they defeat russia ! you're russian , aren't you ? bombing innocents in mali , libya , syria and so on . > we're among the baddies , really . no , you are among the baddies . probably a literal "" tankie ""."
4170,"yes .. iraq and afghanistan did .. not nuclear deterrence and mutually assured destruction , no . it was iraq and afghanistan .. in case you were curious , if the us or any other nuclear nato country did intervene , then it would be two nuclear powers engaging in conventional warfare .. and ... can you guess what would happen then ? nukes would be launched , and all of us would be dead , per the mutually assured destruction concept , which russia and america both established back in that shitty , earth-fucking time known as the cold war ."
4171,"what's masculine ? i don't know , but ** wikipedia says **: masculinity ( also called manhood or manliness ) is a set of attributes , behaviors , and roles associated with men and boys . masculinity can be understood as socially constructed , and there is also evidence that some behaviors considered masculine are influenced by both cultural factors and biological factors . to what extent masculinity is biologically or socially influenced is subject to debate . it is distinct from the definition of the biological male sex , as anyone can exhibit masculine traits . standards of masculinity vary across different cultures and historical periods . want more info ? [ here is the wikipedia link !]( ** this action was performed automatically [.]("
4172,"dont get into extremes . i dont view femininity as a negative concept , i would even argue that in a peace-time its a virtue . ( as vague masculinity/femininity are as a concept ) i was rather trying to make a its better to be a warrior in a garden than a gardener at war.sort of point ."
4173,"british and couldn't agree more . not fair to rely on us lives and taxpayer money to defend europe . the us doesn't have healthcare yet is expected to defend the whole civilised world . i would like to see open conflict with russia , declare an open season on their military - and any attacks on civilians to be met with retaliation on a huge scale ( we just need to say this and hope we don't have to do it ). otherwise we are just waiting for them to slowly destroy freedom and democracy . makes no sense to cower and appease ."
4174,"not a good one ; they arent going away . if every crazed lunatic threatens nuclear war to justify invading other nations , plundering resources , stealing from civilians , raping civilians , ruining cities , cutting off food supplies , and killing civilians ; how can this world be better than it is today ? id rather be dead ; than appease authoritarian invaders raping my wife and kids and worrying about empty threats of nuclear war . beyond this , a nuclear response to being pushed back to your borders by a conventional force after you invaded another nation isnt justified . i think there is no nation , that will find justification in a nuclear attack by russia ."
4175,russia continue to do that and must be stopped .
4176,"no they wont ; they dont have the capacity to project their force in that manner . if defeated in ukraine ; their military , demographics , and economy wont support a general war in europe ."
4177,"i thought you were advocating invading russia . ya , i mean if at some point we just said hey , the world is starving because if you , you dont get to do this and then established air cover , thatd end it in a week ."
4178,exactly ; putins russia needs dealt with now . the world wont benefit by giving russia ukrainian land that isnt europes to give . if europe does nothing and appeases putins dictatorship ; thus allowing russia to strengthen its influence on europethe eu and its member nations deserve every bad thing that happens to them as a result .
4179,not in the case of my post . trump is so yesterday.......time to stop fearing him . move on with life .... tds is a form of ptsd.....imo .
4180,"if putin "" felt empowered "" when trump was in office then he would have attacked when trump was in office ."
4181,more likely putin felt emboldened by his ' perception ' of a weak biden . joe has sure shown his true-colors .
4182,i think theyll start traveling when they know in which direction its heading
4183,"i agree . those are all luxuries people can easily do without for the time it takes to get black sea ports open and fuck russia's brains out . i'm in the uk and petrol here local to me has gone up from around 1.50 a litre in feb to 1.85 today . every time i fill up my car i am simply thankful some fucking psycho isn't bombing my town and raping my daughter . we need to keep a sense of perspective here . the eu is fucking rich and i am sure the usa will assist if things get bad , but they won't . i think we'll topple that scumbag in the kremlin before this year is out , or at the very least get the grain out of ukraine by one means or another ."
4184,doesn't mean that a big part of the under middle class isn't struggling with food even in western europe . it's often too easy to forget about the struggling .
4185,30k with mortgage and 2 cars and two kids . is that even possible pre-covid ?
4186,"good luck getting visas for a travel to europe for a war . also good luck going back again . beyond that , have fun leaving your home while your family is barely keeping it together already . also , you need to pay 3 times your yearly salary to do this from most african countries . haven't seen any europeans in the war paying 150k euro to participare in the war yet , let me know when you find one ! quit the bullshit comparison , for me to participate in the war is 0,1 % of my yearly salary in gasoline and a 12 hour drive . my family would be fine . for everyone else it's applying for visas , shit on your family and pay 3.000 times more relative to your salary than me"
4187,not all of humanity .
4188,american here . thank you for understanding . it's rough to be told 24/7 that you are a nation of warmongers and then have the exact same people refuse to foot the bill for their own defense .
4189,i meant to list the uk and some other former soviet states as an exception here ;).
4190,you can't really accurately diagnose actual ptsd from one ( single short sentence ) post on the internet that has nothing to do with it . tds is not a real thing . and it was used as an ad hominem to dismiss what was said as you never rebuked what was said . though if you check you'll find that i did .
4191,nice try . trump's not getting away that easily .
4192,"not necessarily . also putin first attacked ukraine in obamas time , and continued to attack throughout trumps . but really that should be posed to the op as i said that the lack of unity was possibly a factor . i didn't say trump alone ( or directly ) emboldened him . personally , i think multiple governments around the world have failed to confront the problem for a long time and only if they all hadn't would things potentially be different . therefore trump alone is not the cause ."
4193,"possibly a factor . seems you and the op are alike in reaching for a diffinative reason to opportion blame ( or absolve it ) for partisan gains . without a trump or a biden you still have the us , china , the eu , and others ( and all their own internal machinations ) as variables in putins geo political games ."
4194,"admittedly , i dont know the english language classes got me , thats more of a thing in eastern europe"
4195,"a 1 bedroom shack in mississippi 50 miles from civilization , perhaps ."
4196,"a very large portion would be killed pretty much instantly and the earth would be rendered uninhabitable due to radiation , so , yes , all of humanity would be killed , either by the nukes or by the fallout ."
4197,"same . if i don't have free healthcare because we have to play world police , we shouldn't be looked down upon for wanting to stop things before they get out of hand . my entire adult life putin has been a thorn in the side of modern democracy and the propaganda his regime puts out is carried beyond it's borders with russian immigrants . it's exhausting ."
4198,opinions.......can't really be effectively ' rebuked '. you know that......right ?
4199,"here is another ' opinion ' that disagrees with you on the reality of tds ...... "" politicians on both sides have similar motives . many minor republican politicians became small-time celebrities on fox news by their reliable support of whatever trump said or did . if trump fades from view , they may fade from view , too . but tds is likelier to infect the democratic side . their narrow coalition ranges across the ideological aisle , from staunch democratic socialists such as the members of the squad to former republicans who still pine for the gop of their youth . this diverse collection is united by only one thing : hatred or dislike of trump . the more trumps misdeeds or potential return to power is kept front and center , the likelier it is that democrats can retain control of both chambers of congress in next years midterms ."""
4200,"you too.....seem to be afflicted . "" people with ptsd have intense , disturbing thoughts and feelings related to their experience that last long after the traumatic event has ended . they may relive the event through flashbacks or nightmares ; they may feel sadness , fear or anger ; and they may feel detached or estranged from other people . people with ptsd may avoid situations or people that remind them of the traumatic event , and they may have strong negative reactions to something as ordinary as a loud noise or an accidental touch ."""
4201,"nah , merely ' opinions'.....just like your posts ."
4202,ps - ....... definitive .....
4203,"> opinions.......can't really be effectively ' rebuked '. > you know that......right ? he meant rebutted , as i'm sure you know . if an incorrect word choice doesn't hinder meaning it's not really necessary to pick at it , particularly on a sub where many have english as a second language"
4204,put a sock in it . nobody is buying your bullshit .
4205,opinions can't really be rebutted.....either . everyone is entitled to their own opinions . purported facts or accusations........can be rebutted .
4206,ps - you know that....right ?
4207,ptsd is treatable ....... once you get past the ' denial '...... hope that you get well .
4208,mate the only one that needs treatment here is you .
4209,denial.......is not only a river in egypt .
4210,german engineering a shame we cant send a lot more of em though
4211,with nice regards from germany and netherlands !
4212,"from the article , qouting a facebook post from the mod "" a 155mm self-propelled gun panzerhaubitze 2000 has already ' worked ' against russian invaders on the eastern borders . rapid fire . precision . effective use of ammunition . minimum time for hitting a target and leaving a combat position . the pzh 2000 is a german combat vehicle weighing over 55 tonnes and already ' registered ' with the ukrainian armed forces ,"" the report reads ."""
4213,and 6 more on the way !
4214,must be so weird for the engineers that all these years later it actually gets to do exactly what it was designed to do .
4215,just like grandpa uses to do
4216,so happy that we finally deliver very useful and effective weapons supporting the ukrainians . lets hope it will be more soon and including some new rheinmetall tanks .
4217,"i believe germany still has 100 + of them remaining . since there's zero chance of anyone invading germany or a nato ally , i would wish germany would send maybe 30 or 40 of them to ukraine ."
4218,the last time we did it was used to erase spain villages
4219,but we will . this was just anounced a few days ago . ger and nl will send additional 6 units .
4220,and nice thanks from ukraine !
4221,but do we know if putin did not get upset by this ? :(
4222,the video is funny showing them ' scoot ' but only 25 yards
4223,those phz-2000 obliterated more taliban than you can count in afghanistan ...
4224,the people over at / r/bundeswehr have been very giddy at the prospect of a big field study for this equipment .
4225,afghanistan tho ?
4226,"the new panther is a prototype ... likely years away from mass production , maybe a single year if germany itself was at war"
4227,"is there any source regarding trainig of ukraine soldiers on the krab system , or are they already familiar with it ? nevertheless the german behavior is accurate but slow . and you can see this in many areas ."
4228,ukrainian soldiers themselves said that the 40 days training were sorely needed . they also needed to be refurbished and lastly shipped . polish krabs already existed at the manufacturer side and are vastly less sophisticated .
4229,apparently they had to install a geofencing to ensure the weapons destroy themselves moment they cross russian border - in case ukrainians got carried away and tried to invade moscow with these 6 howitzers .
4230,"there are only 40 operational , 68 were cannibalized for parts , and kept in storage . from those 68 the 7 best were taken and refurbished and partially upgraded . according to rumors , the bundeswehr is bound by nato and some other agreement - e.g . the bundeswehr is obliged to provide training to all pzh2k users - to keep a minimum of 36 fully operational . this number might be increased with the nato response force expansion . soon ukraine will get another 3 , the minister of defense admitted that the limit has been reached , so people assume those 3 are from the operational ones , so 37 are left . now the remaining 61 inoperational ones need to be upgraded , as kmw/rheinmetall don't deliver certain spare parts for the old variants , thus forcing the users to upgrade , because weapons producers are both greedy and smart . lithuania had bought 21 pzh2k in 2015 , those needed to be upgraded as well , the first ones were delivered in 2016 , the last ones in 2022 . that would be 3 upgraded per year , which is unfortunately realistic capacity wise , kmw/rheinmetall need to expand quickly . in essence , it might be months before another pzh2k is upgraded/refurbished ."
4231,"according to this : germany has about 108 currently in four artillery battalions and maybe 30-40 in storage ( those 30-40 in storage might have been the ones sold to lithuania and croatia , article isn't clear ). so they likely cannot send any more until more are ordered , since 50 or so would be something close to half their total stocks . i know it's only been 4 months , but our respective mics need to start production yesterday ."
4232,"yes , we should give them 30-50 !"
4233,"please don't put this onto your resume , herr kraut ."
4234,"nahhhhhhhhh his corrupt army ruined his perfect plan already so much , that will not hurt him more :- d"
4235,nah . these would make ruzzians showing more gestures of goodwill 
4236,"i am sure he called this unfair , and is threatening to nuke germany , the netherlands , and andorra ."
4237,putin upset ? not at all ! quite the opposite . it has prompted him to express more goodwill .
4238,it drives in meters ; p
4239,"yeah , it's so weird how everyone thinks germany didn't do anything militarily after wwii . it had by far the biggest military in europe during the cold war : > in the 1980s , the bundeswehr had 12 army divisions with 36 brigades and ** far more than 7,000 battle tanks **, armoured infantry fighting vehicles and other tanks ; 15 flying combat units in the air force and the navy with some ** 1,000 combat aircraft **; 18 surface-to-air-missile battalions , and naval units with around ** 40 missile boats and 24 submarines **, as well as several destroyers and frigates . its material and personnel contribution even just to natos land forces and integrated air defence in central europe amounted to around 50 percent . this meant that , during the cold war , by the 1970s , the bundeswehr had already become ** the largest western european armed forces after the us armed forces in europe far ahead of the british and even the french armed forces **. in peacetime , the bundeswehr had ** 495,000 military personnel . in a war , it would have had access to 1.3 million military personnel ** by calling up reservists . the somewhat weakened bundeswehr is a recent development and even then germany still has the seventh largest military budget in the world : and is still active all over the world : > military personnel are currently serving on twelve operations on three continents ."
4240,"very much so , sir , yes . ru bots/tankies/trolls have been infesting most of our comment sections as well , hyping up their own capabilities while suggesting the things we said we were able to do with our equipment was fabricated and we'd get rolled over by ru in 24 hours . it's like the school yard bully deciding to take it up with the kid everybody told him to stay far away from , only for him to get decked in almost immediately . if the surrounding circumstances weren't tens of thousand of innocent lives being lost i'd say this war would be a hilarious sight to see ."
4241,not the type of conflict they were designed for .
4242,the panther is a very new craftsmanship indeed . i rather hope for many leopards or other stuff .
4243,how many krab systems do you need for each zerschmetterling ?
4244,i think more like russia stealing them .
4245,could i get a source .
4246,thank you for the reporting
4247,yeah i really do hope that the military industry is going into overdrive . they should have priority on the necessary components . the west's economical superiority counts for little if we don't use more of our industrial capacity for defense .
4248,"yeah seems about right , the netherlends has the same problem , the extra 3 they are sending where used for training and everything in storage already went to ukraine . i believe netherlands only has about 20 left total now ."
4249,"poland has already delivered a third of the tanks and a fourth of the ahs krab spgs , among many other vehicles . germany is at even less risk of hostilities , they can send 12 , 18 more ."
4250,"dude , shut the fuck up . the holocaust and world war 2 has been the justification for every other nation to criticize everything that germany ever did militarywise after ww2 . you will find tons of scientific papers , news articles , etc through the last decades talking about if germany really should be a strong military power again ."
4251,"and quite rightly so . same with japan . what they did nearly lead to the total annihilation of thier countries . they had a lot of repenting to do . the most obvious way to mend relationships and regain trust , is to show you have no further aspirations of expeditionary warfare . the easiest way to do that is to maintain a modest army and restrict where and how your forces can be used ."
4252,> this account has been suspended
4253,"they had that dumbass evening talkshow host with the burnt out italian villa talk about nuking the port of rotterdam . why ? they determined it brings in 40 % of oil coming into the eu . i thought it was typical that they focused on oil , it's the eu's biggest sea port full stop . taking it out completely would cause more problems then just affecting oil related supply chains , yet they only care about who europeans pay for oil ."
4254,and those 22 meters or so could get it out of the critical zone ... if the russians had the same accuracy as itself
4255,"yeah in another thread on reddit on why people were afraid of russia some people brought up how supposedly the nato was so undergunned and outnumbered that they needed atomic bombs or they would never have stopped the soviet union . while the soviet union had an estimated 4-5 million soldiers and tenthousands of tanks , planes etc . germany alone had 1.5 million troops even outnumbering the us army in 1980 and backed by another 600k french soldiers and 160k british professional soldiers . the nato forces were large ( especially germanys bundeswehr ) and had a lot of equipment of which most was superior to the ussr ."
4256,the bundeswehr used to make some sweet parka coats and shirts . our army surplus shops are full of them .
4257,why would it be weird for people to think that after starting ( being crude with that word ) two world wars that maybe they actually wouldnt do anything militarily after the second one ?
4258,same way it was an idiotic decision to send german navy ships on anti-piracy operations off the coast of africa when the ships ' systems were never designed to operate in climates like that .
4259,leos are mainly kmw . and sadly of limited use due to not having any active defence
4260,"really hard to say , but the pzh 2000 has 10 rpm and the krab 6 , pzh 2000 seems to get 6 km more range of comparable ammunition and of course it has that nice link to counterbattery radar , but maybe krab can offer something similar . both are good systems i would say ."
4261,* american industrial complex has entered the chat *
4262,"except poland has been planning to expand its armed forces for awhile now . germany hasn't until very recently . i would agree with you 100 % on those numbers if the german mic was up and running , which is it really isn't yet . macron has only just started to talk about the same . europe isn't ready yet to contribute much more , and i believe they will . they see how much of a threat russia is now , which is exactly why they'll be hesitant to part with much more of their stocks : they're hedging their bets against russia winning until their own military industries can get into gear . the real onus is on the us here , who i think should be doing more . there's something like 500 mlrs and close to 500 m109 paladins in storage...why aren't we sending more of those ? there are legitimate reasons to not send over abrahms tanks i understand now , but i don't think those same reasons apply to the mlrs and self-propelled artillery we got in storage . for the record , i have mad respect for countries like slovakia , poland , and the balts for standing up to the russians as much as they have . they just have to give their western european neighbors time to catch up , sadly . in the meanwhile , the us needs to be the one to pick up the slack ."
4263,"> a third of the tanks to be fair , poland does expect an upgrade in the form of leopard 2's from germany for that , same as with the ring swap involving the czech republic . the explanation for not sending more pzh2000 was that the others are needed to fulfill nato obligations . in terms of risk , it's not like either poland or germany stand alone ; if push comes to shove , the entirety of the eu is at war one way or the other . that said , i agree it would be good to send more . a lot of these howitzers have been cannibalized for maintenance of the operational units ; restoring these would certainly be faster than producing new ones , so i could see more transfers in the future as they come out of repairs ."
4264,"lets be honest . if russia steps into poland that is an attack on nato and the us will unleash what it has spent 30 years storing . as much as i respect the fighting spirit of poland , the us can match that and finish this conflict . so if poland has something it is keeping for its own defence , now is the time to unleash it ."
4265,"well , poland and the other border nato counrties are dependend on the realy high tech stuff countries like germany do deploy to obtain the defence needed . so russia wont be as stupid to invade . there have to be units deployed to the "" front "" but we also need units to train new soldiers on the equiptemt used . sending more phz 2000 to ukraine would mean that germany cant train all their units in the use of those and also that germany isnt able to provide the necessary forces they promissed to nato . poland can send so much of their stuff , because they now , that nato will fill those gaps ."
4266,"that is stupid . nobody is scared of germany starting a world war again , that is ridiculous . everyone knows that ultranationalism in germany is no stronger than in france or italy . the matter of fact is the germans have a pacifist tradition . it isn't anything about international politics whatsoever , it's entirely domestic politics . politicians were scared of going against the pacifist grain ."
4267,"> while the soviet union had an estimated 4-5 million soldiers and tenthousands of tanks , planes etc . germany alone had 1.5 million troops even outnumbering the us army in 1980 you need to get your facts straight"
4268,ussr troops in the gdr were already shit back then in 1990 . tanks rusting in the fields . nva troops on the other hand . we had to fear those .
4269,"> germany alone had 1.5 million troops even outnumbering the us army in 1980 germany had fewer than 500,000 troops in 1980 , the us over 2 mill ."
4270,1980 was a loooong time ago .
4271,the newest ones do have active defense .
4272,so a 5 to 3 ratio on rpm . plus further range . whats the krabs mobility like ?
4273,** send one squadron of a-10's to cover that heavy metal .**
4274,"the most important attribute of the third reich was that it was fascist , not that it was german . the lesson is not that we should demilitarize germans , but that we should demilitarize fascists . currently the fascists are a bit further east ."
4275,"you've structured your comment in two paragraphs , i will only respond to the first one , as the second gathers no objections from me , i find the american approach to be confusing , on one hand they are delivering a lot , but they aren't delivering decisive equipment , it seems like they are trying to bleed russia out , without allowing a decisive defeat . from reputable russia analysts , like michael kofman or konrad muzyka we know that russia will not be able to perform major military operations for the next few years , their estimates range from 3 years to seven-ish , depending on lifting of sanctions , general mobilization and post-conflict approach to rearmament . poland is on the frontline , with no nato allies between it and russia , with two land borders to russia ( kaliningrad and belarus ) and has to perform a qrf duty to the baltic states . at the same time , it found it reasonable to create a large gap in its capabilities . other states , who simply do not have those concerns , can essentially leave themselves significantly disarmed if they wanted to . i'm talking about france , or spain , or italy , or a number of smaller countries . there's simply no risk in the coming years . germany has the time , money and expertise to literally send all it's pzh2k , scrap all the parts in storage and bomb the factory , then rebuild that manufacturing capability from the ground up , before first pzh2k come back for servicing . by the time russia would be ready for another operation the fleet would be back in play . obviously this is idiotic and i'm just writing it to insist on how good the german position is at the moment . i'm not saying they should leave their country defenceless , i'm saying it's a drop in the bucket for them , or even less , but it's gamechanging for ukraine ."
4276,as far as i know the remaining pzh2k are in lithuania along with german nato troops .
4277,"that trust is quite recent . just 25 years ago there was a strong subcurrent of hate and/or distrust in my part of europe . trust arrives on foot and leaves on horseback . and after working on this for 50-60 years , it's hard to switch back to a more assertive stance . it may not be ideal for the current war , but it was necessary to be able build europe into the community that is now ."
4278,germany and japan have pacifist traditions because they were forced on them for a very long time until all the war hawks were dead of old age .
4279,"> the matter of fact is the germans have a pacifist tradition . it isn't anything about international politics whatsoever , it's entirely domestic politics . concerns about german power was a real issue when the wall fell . back then , germany still hadn't regained full sovereignty and needed the allies ' approval for reunification . thatcher rather openly opposed , and famously said "" i love germany so much i'm glad there are two of them ."" mitterand apparently wasn't entirely comfortable with the idea , either . you can read a short paragraph with some choice quotes of the two [ on wikipedia ]( if you can't imagine this having been a concern not too long ago . it's no coincidence that this was when bundeswehr's decline began . ( edit : to clarify for the younger ones , thatcher was prime minister of the uk , and mitterand the french president . also , 33 years aren't as long as you may think .)"
4280,yeah but only 150k strong nva was elite but small
4281,"yeah , it's pretty much common knowledge . even if people didn't learn about the cold war , afghanistan was much more recent and germany was one of the countries that responded when the usa invoked article 5 ( the only time in nato history ). so yes , it is weird that people believe germany didn't have any military for decades because of wwii ."
4282,sauce
4283,"on road , both are at 67 kp/h , off-road pzh is 45 kp/h vs krab with 30 kp/h , so significantly faster . both have a similar driving range ."
4284,"fun fact : the large uranium bullet firing gau-8/a "" avenger "" canon on the a10 is incapable of penetrating the armor of modern mbts . the a10 relies on surface-to-ground missiles to destroy modern tanks ."
4285,"yeah , i edited thst post a few times my bad . look , in spirit i agree with you entirely . but i'm trying to see this from the german perspective too . one in which irresponsible levels of austerity over the course of the last 20 or so years has lead to the bundeswehr's own generals admitting they didn't have the capacity to defend their own borders . when their own strategists are saying something akin to , "" hey , we're kinda fucked "", and then a war pops up on your borders , do you think politicians are going to be more or less likely to send over military kit when they already have so little ? again , hedging their bets . i don't agree with it , but it also seems to be a part of their calculus . the fact that zelensky has gotten them to part with what they have so far is nothing short of a great display of political acumen deserving of praise--especially considering their diplomatic snafus not so long ago ."
4286,"right , that was quite a while ago though . that was my point . i have never heard any serious politician today worrying about germany invading places , that is my point ."
4287,even the so called kosovo war was not that long ago where litteraly german leopard 2's marched in under kfor and with operation allied force the luftwaffe fired some 200 harm missiles at targets .
4288,[ [ [ so i wonder what made you say leos are of limited use . the leopard 2 is among the best mbt's anyone could buy .
4289,"sorry , you sounded like you had all the knowledge on hand . in theory we have all the worlds knowledge at hand , and hence no need to ever have any conversation online ."
4290,"based . the a-10 is shit , but not many people know that ."
4291,"i think your position is perfectly reasonable and in line with traditional diplomatic thinking - providing assistance while not compromising ones capability . i just think it doesn't work in this century and in this diplomatic situation . there are two factors for my thinking : 1 ) there's no conventional threat to germany or allies and there is no threat in which the pzh2k is a sine qua non of success 2 ) if russia decides to move conventionally against nato , there will be intel months in advance . i understand they want to retain the capability as part of conventional , or even traditional military strategy , i just find it capricious considering the circumstances ."
4292,"i guess whether this was a long time ago is a matter of perspective , but ( west -) germany's position in ( western ) europe was quite similar to that of germany today , with france and germany being an iconic duo and all that . the german military used to be much larger due to the cold war , but if anything , pacifism used to be much stronger in germany . i still remember how german participation in * unarmed * un peacekeeping missions was a hot political topic . armed missions during the breakup of yugoslavia a few years later broke a political taboo , and caused a major domestic backlash . if germany had reinvested into its military in , say , 2000 , it would have seemed to confirm the worst fears people had when it reunified . in europe , there weren't any complaints about german under-investment into its military before russia occupied crimea . and that was in the middle of the eurozone's sovereign debt crisis , hardly a great time to increase the defense budget , hopefully obviously a very recent time . in any case , maybe nobody is scared of germany starting another world war * today *, but it's not ridiculous at all to say that such fears existed at the time when germany reduced the size of its military thirty years ago , and they certainly didn't vanish over night , either . thatcher and mitterand weren't some kind of paranoid political fringe , after all . seriously , read those quotes i linked to if you haven't yet ."
4293,i still remember british articles bitching about luftwaffe jets flying missions in other countries again .
4294,"yes , yes , already erased my mild annoyance . in any case , it is the superior system . - has excalibur integration - best in class for accuracy - etc . krabs are quite good though and will likely outperform most russian systems ."
4295,"i'm not a military expert , but the a-10 seems to be a reliable workhorse for the us army . the large gau cannon and heavy armor are still great for destroying lightly armored targets like supply trucks or artillery batteries ."
4296,"the a-10 has no friend/foe detection system , which is why it has the largest friendly fire kill count of all us aircraft . also the gau-8 is pretty inacurate and therefore dangerous to ground troops who rely on it for fire support . for more information watch lazerpigs videos on why the a-10 sucks ."
4297,its also great at hosing down tree lines and hedges that could be hiding orcs . only problem is the clouds of aa manpads that would greet an a-10 over a front line .
4298,"azov battalion aside , this is an interesting mix of westerm uniforms with soviet style parades and bravado . nothing wrong with that , just an interesting dichotomy . slava ukraini ! saint javelin - slay for us"
4299,ukraine are a fucking epic nation
4300, song ?
4301,cool video but as a jew its hard to like these guys . ukraine 
4302,you should retire azov image it's not good for the cause
4303,"after they whoop the russians , these guys should liberate them from putin"
4304,"sorry putin , you fell into a trap , ukraine is your trap ."
4305,while this video is cool and all this is the whole reason russia thinks ukraine has nazis . this is the particular people theyre talking about . they are a super ultra right nationalist group . its a small group and they dont represent all of ukrainian people . they do have a bad ass looking army though . cant front on that
4306,why is it all azov battalion
4307,banger
4308,that transition at 0:59
4309,"ukraine are offering free trips back to russia by foot , or in a box . choice is yours russia"
4310,no country should ever give up when invaded !!
4311,keep fighting the good fight . canada stands with you !
4312,so all i see is a bunch of swastikas on their flags and uniforms . fuck that . i'm not supporting that
4313,pull this . or place a disclaimer about the true size and nature of the unit shown because we kinda know by now they're reputation and it's bad folks .

4321,these guys are surrounded and outnumbered in mariupol and russia wants to crush them . i dont like these guys symbols or believe in what they do but i know when the rest of the ua army folded in 2014 these dudes have held the lines in the donbas and mariupol from the moskals since 2014 . a few bad apples spoils the bunch because these dudes love ukraine .
4322,only one invading crew acting like gnatzz far as i can see and thats the rushins . personal hates and politics aside thats a dope video . go ukraine !
4323,no ne could ever be as amazing as the ukraine defenders . amazing people fighting for their lives . kicking ass and taking names !
4324,"canadas got your back boys , maybe not our shit government but the people do !!"

4337,agreed the video would be nice if they didnt include the nazis
4338,???
4339,dvrst - close eyes tiktok remix
4340,agree
4341,kinda hard because theyre were a huge reason ukraine was able to survive 2014 + years but yes pr wise it needs to be done somehow
4342,yes why ? there is plenty of non-azov image on internet
4343,maybe they produced the video ???
4344,doesn't it look like russian propaganda ? ' see the ukrainians shoot at houses .'
4345,but these nazis are in with the rest of the ukrainian forces . the regular forces have just accepted them in . this is not good and this is why putin is wanting them out
4346,russian soldiers are in the video ? thanks for informing me . i don't want to see russian soldiers

4348,i found the song and its dvrst - close eyes same vibe tho !
4349,it still wouldn't hide the fact they they exist by not showing them .
4350,"that's the reason putin is giving , but there is no justification for him to go into a sovereign nation by force and take care of the matter . there are racists in every military . it's ukraine's problem to deal with . putin just can't stand the idea of ukraine becoming a proud nation of its own , and is simply following the russian tradition of erasing the ukranian language , it's culture and it's people ."
4351,"no its that the majority of the videos are from the azov battalion which are literal nazis that indoctrinate child , the only reason they are i thing is because of ukraines constitution . slava ukraini"
4352,ukraine is an epic nation .
4353,"oh believe me , i agree percent with you ."
4354,"1 . didnt watch the video , so i thought you were a russian troll 2 . idk what exactly the azov battalion did ( ive heard they have some neo-nazis ) so i cant comment much on this subject"
4355,i couldn't agree more
4356,"they're a far right battalion with a large percentage of their force being neo-nazi fighters . look at their logo and you'll infer what many of them believe . they are one of the primary reasons why russians consider every ukrainian soldier a nazi . they were the primary defenders of mariupol and azovstal and are known to be pretty fierce fighters but politically , they are nationalistic and many are racists/white supremacists . they are tolerated because in these trying times , ukraine needs every able body they can muster"
4357,"they're just being a condescending twatwaffle about your grammar , even though it's obvious to everyone what you are saying ( your original comment should be "" ukraine ** is ** a fucking epic nation ""). the meaning is still the same , they just want to make themselves feel better about their lives by correcting someone who probably speaks english as a second language . but , they managed to fuck that up anyways by misquoting your original comment and what was wrong with it ( you wouldn't use the indefinite article ""** an **"" before the word ""** fucking .**"" that would just sound fucking stupid ). so they aren't just a condescending twatwaffle , they're also wrong and i'd bet my left nut that english is their first and only language ."
4358,never saw pics of azov soldiers with nazi tattoos . but ive seen plenty of ruzzian soldiers with nazi tattoos .
4359,"also you could use "" are "" validly to talk about the cultural nation of the ukrainian people rather than the state of ukraine"
4360,"note ukraine having more long-range artillery gives the russian army a nasty problem . if they have the supply depots well back from the front , their road-bound truck convoys are vulnerable to ukranian special forces and drone attacks , and are limited in capacity in any case . if the supply depots are close to the front , they can get attacked by ukranian artillery ."
4361,they put the pop in popasna .
4362,""" idk man , that doesn't look like a big ... oh damn ..."""
4363,"nice shooting , now go fuck up the units that will shortly run out of ammunition ."
4364,working at these ammo dumps must be like russian roulette on steroids .
4365,i love those big booms . wondering if we can get estimates of what was there . i can imagine soldiers working there beating the 100m run world record then the long jump by a lot .
4366,[ big bada boom ](
4367,russians out there lashing out at civilian targets and ukraine just tapping back hard with precision strikes .
4368,"ho.ly . cow that's big . i love all these recent ammo hits . i mean , apart from the pollution and all , but i guess that can't be helped . they must be getting some great intel to be hitting so accurately , which is nice too ."
4369,keep this up and the orcs will soon be forced to ride into battle on their warpigs ( wives ) wielding hatchets 
4370,they were filming it because they knew they were going to hit it . ammo dumps have lots of traffic that can be tracked .
4371,"well , ammo is supposed to go off at some point , the helpful ukrainians just sped up the process ."
4372,that looks like an artillery hit on something very explosive like a giant gas storage facility . whats in popasana ? orange is unusual color
4373,slava ukraini !
4374,hope civilians are okay .
4375,fuckin *** pop *** goes the weasel
4376,"very big boom indeed . many more of those please . doesn't matter how many guns the orcs have , if they don't have ammo for them . slava ukraini heroiam slava "
4377,i think we are seeing real-time nato intelligence and real-time nato weapons in the hands of real-time ukrainian military personnel laying the foundation for a near-time counteroffensive that is likely going to result in a massive defeat and humiliation for the orc leader and orcussia .
4378,nice . that's some well-roasted orc .
4379,a hellishly big bang .
4380,that made me jump ! wow wow wow
4381,i just love that the nazis are doing all of these goodwill gestures - keep it up !
4382,vbb - very big boom
4383,big bada boom
4384,maybe this was one of ruzzias firework stores where they were keeping everything ready for their big celebration......oh well... 
4385,so many ammo storage sites going kaboom - surely each one causes a massive logistical challenge for russia ? how many do they even have ??
4386,why they think it was ammunition storage?....ah...ok...that's why 
4387,slava ukraini !!!
4388,"jesus christ you could even see the vacuum happen . that huge puff of white smoke that instantly gets sucked in , i havent seen that happen in the war yet"
4389,russia has made a habit of effing itself but now ukraine is generously offering assistance
4390,so i've read somewhere that russia is shooting 50k shells each day . would anyone here have a remote idea of how many shells would be in an ammo storage like this ?
4391,are we sure that is ammo ? it looks like when the fertilizer in beirut blew up .
4392,was it ammo or chemical ? seems similar to the chemical hit not long ago . not seeing many secondary explosions you see .
4393,nice
4394,reminds me of lebanon 
4395,"as an australian , id just like to say : take that , cunts"
4396,yeah nice ! big bada boom !
4397,nice ! how many orcs ?
4398,are we dangerous ?
4399,that's one impressive boom
4400,probably bagged a few roaches too
4401,orks in spaaaaaaaaaaaace
4402,more like opasna ... ( means danger in ru )
4403,"big badaboom , chicken good !"
4404,big bada-boom !
4405,they are smart to attack arms depots . if you can drain the ammo then it won't matter how many tanks they have .
4406,"happy 4th putin , ya cunt ! ua is gonna end you ."
4407,"wow , looking at a map , popasna isn't very far from the front line at all : about 15 miles south of lysychans'k . seems like a really , really vulnerable place to store ammunition . are the invaders able to transport ammo and supplies further than 15 miles ? i would assume so , but i wonder how badly off their logistics chain is after all the losses earlier in the war ."
4408,ua soldier : bro im not shure if we hit the depo . kabooooooooooommmm !!! ua soldier : i guest i was wrong
4409,"these are honestly some of my favorite videos ever . not just because it shows a massive explosion that only hurts russia , but it has amazing lasting consequences for russia as well : they not only lost the depot in and of itself , along with who knows how many combatants and vehicles , but crap tons of their own ammo as well ! i especially love seeing ammo cook-off , because then it means that's less ammo that could hurt ukraine , and is instead hurting russia ."
4410,"fewer ruzzian artillery , rocket , mortar and tank rounds to deal with . good shooting ."
4411,was that a russian ammo storage ?
4412,"yes rico , kaboom ."
4413,oh reekris - bootleg fireworks guy probably
4414,10/10 would watch again .
4415,beirut russia edition

4424,such a beautiful boom ! more please
4425,** big bada-boom !**
4426,"so wait , you can actually hit an ammo storage instead of anything else with civilians in it ?"
4427,yikes ! you werent lying . enormous explosion .
4428,"everything is going to plan in this special military operation ok ?!?! i love how they still call it "" special military operation "" whilst also talking about front lines and other war time terminology all the time ."
4429,shrivel up like the douche bag on putin
4430,the russians blew it themselves as a goodwill gesture .
4431,ok now do the ammo dump in transnistria
4432,the amount of ammo depots that have been hit has been staggering recently
4433,"ok , we're getting close "
4434,how large was that explosion on the michael bay scale ?
4435,"does anyone have an estimate of about how many ammo depots russia has ? ive heard of at least 5 ammo depots since the first reports of himars usage . 5 may be a lot , but is it a lot relative to how many ammo depots russia has ?"
4436,ive seen a lot of these ammo depot explosions going on . how many people on average are stationed around one ?
4437,beautiful . thank you uaf .
4438,by the size of explosion looks like cigarette pot .
4439,"makes me happy . i have to believe that the us has indeed sent the ridiculous long range rockets for the himars . sure they said they didnt but ever since they got the himars the ammo depots have been going down daily in a massive boom . havent noticed any missed shots when drone footage shows some from above so no craters and such , just a video starts and then depot goes boom . i mean ukraine has been doing remarkable things the entire war but lately its like they are letting russia know who the number 1 power in ukraine is . slava ukraini !"
4440,no war in ukraine
4441,"shit , looks like a nuke "
4442,holy crap . that's ridiculous .
4443,bada boom . the russian orcs are getting a multi-pass in ukraine to meet death .
4444,very big boom indeed .
4445,big boom . big bada boom !
4446,big bada boom 
4447,nice (!) boom .
4448,how far away would someone need to be from this to not get fried ?
4449,that is a huge explosion even if you are a mile away you probably be blown off your feet welcome to ukraine 
4450,dammust have been more than 152mm shells in there for a cloud that big . rockets too ?
4451,i love secondary explosions of war criminals .
4452,"i'm not an expert , but i would guess there were significant amount of artillery shells and mrls rockets in there . good job !"
4453,holy hell . any other videos of this explosion ?
4454,damn . nasa might have heard that one .
4455,someone should send them empty beer bottles they can return to make sure they have enough money to go home ...
4456,appears to be another gesture of goodwill .
4457,"i would prefer to die in that blast than return to russia and see my wife , with her teeth missing and more hair on her arms than a gorilla ."
4458,"first 10 seconds : huh okay i guess it's kind of blurry , looks like something did get hit but i don't see what all the -- rest of video : oh holy fuck"
4459,nice ! i like ! insert borat meme .
4460,came here for the pop .
4461,"this warms my heart . not as much as the folks at that ammo dump , but still ."
4462,loving the mushroom cloud . ominousss can you imagine being a russian soldier down range of that ? they must have thought someone dropped the tsar bomba
4463,what would the fallout be like if there were tactical nukes stored in these ammo dumps ?
4464,sounds like a pretty perfect catch 22 for them .
4465,"man it would be a crying shame if ukraine got a whole mess of excalibur ( 50km range , 4m cep ) rounds and someone with 24/7 satellite surveillance told them where the russian ammo depots all were ."
4466,"basically , supply trucks are either taken out or wasted bringing ammo to a centralised location to be destroyed ."
4467,"* trucks supplying from remote dumps are also vulnerable to ukrainian 155mm long range artillery as they move as convoys and the transported 152mm shells tend to detonate when struck by shrapnel , have only wooden boxes for protection . and nato airburst shells provide lots of shrapnel"
4468,and russia does not have the ammount of needed trucks to supply from a big distance i hope ?
4469,or they will be forced to split big depots into smaller ones when close to the front . if this happens just target the vehicles and fuel
4470,"not only that , these supply depos are really huge because of the sheer amount of artillery that the russians are using . these have likely been set up for over a month now at the previous maximum range of ukrainian artillery . this means they were right at the edge of the front . now that there is longer range they either have to accept the danger that they are in or they would have to shift all of them to storage further away from the front at the new maximum range of ukrainian artillery . and that can be pretty hard logistically ."
4471,also russia is completely retarded when it comes to logistics . useless . proven multiple times .
4472,how come ukraine doesnt run into this same issue ? or do they
4473,i've noticed that ukraine keeps having pretty nice hits on enemy ammo supplies . pretty great strategy .
4474,"i imagine those trucks aren't even sufficiently protected to deal with cheaper rpgs and other portable antitank systems ( javelin , at4 , gustav , panzershrek , you name it ) or even landmines . having to rely even more on trucks for transport sounds like a logistic nightmare , especially in places with low visual coverage such as forested terrain ."
4475,sucks to fight nato armed countries doesn't it . they could always fuck off back to russia of course .
4476,i like it when you call me big pop-pa
4477,had exactly the same thought process .
4478,"nice mushroom at the end . what astounds me is theres a way to store ammo so it doesnt all go off , and these fucktards cant even do that ."
4479,that got a few orcs for sure .
4480,nice one . what was the weapon used ?
4481,"this is always my fear when someone posts from a seemingly civilian vehicle driving by a fire . "" look what our soldiers artilleried today !"" that's great , but i really hope it's done ."
4482,\* sigh \* that's what * she * said !
4483,"it's estimated that russia fires 60k shells a day in ukraine . if they have been doing that for 5 months that means they have fired over 9 million shells by this point in the war . given russia has been in multiple wars prior to this ( chechnya , georgia , syria , ukraine 2014 ) and the fact their depots keep getting blown up it's likely they are running low . if russia had to produce shells at say 2k a shell it would cost them 120 million per day to maintain their current rate of fire . that is over 10 % of russia's daily income from fossil fuel sales so that's going to sting ."
4484,"... is easy job , just sit here all day by door as security with those other guys smoking cigarettes over there . all ukrainians have long since retreated . the gatehouse is good 100 feet from warehouse storing stuff that goes boom . if artillery starts coming in you have plenty of time to get away as this stuff takes a lot of time to cook off ..."
4485,"they listen to that russian cover of rem all day : its the end of the vodka , as we know it "
4486,lol ask the orcs on snake island ...
4487,"at least you re gone in a split second , including cremation"
4488,being in a modern war is russian roulette on steroids .
4489,"yeah , like having 200 bullets inside the gun , in one whole...and the gun has no barrell to spin . xd"
4490,"and one of them set a new long jump world record . he landed at 14.5 , at 17 and at 19.5 meters . but was not recognized because the tailwind was too strong"
4491,looking more like a launch into orbit without any rocket engines
4492,"this was the warehouse , where they kept all the russian minds in bottles , which were blown by their dumbass propaganda ."
4493,"one of the best movies ever ..,"
4494,"the ammo was going to be used anyway , and the pollution would have been emitted . it's best they blow it up in one spot , right on top of the russians ."
4495,"a goodwill gesture , as one does ..."
4496,ammonium nitrate maybe ? release of nitrogen oxides are typical with such an explosive .
4497,geroyam slava !
4498,all the civilians were sent to the front with ww2 era helmets and bolt action rifles .
4499,if its an ammo dump there shouldnt be any civilians around .
4500,fuck them right in their orcussy
4501,... big * gooda * boom .
4502,"they still have a lot . remember they were making them since the end of ww2 . however , soon , there will be a reliability problem with old ussr made shells as those made in the last 30 years will run out ."
4503,the other interesting stat is shells divided by guns .. after x shells the gun need to be referbished or it becomes less accurate .. though i'm not sure the orcs care about what they hit .. i got this from a youtube video i'd be interested to know from any artillery specialists to know if its a real concern
4504,"thats what is says in the source , so i just translated . you can see however two distinct clouds ( black and orangish ). not a chemist but to my eye the nitrogen ammonia ( or whatever its called ) had more orangish coloring than here . could it be supplies for vehicles ? could be a chemical reaction of different elements exploding ?"
4505,yeah thought this aswell . the red color on the cloud looks like the chemical factory that blew up . the camera isnt the best though so it could be a misrepresentation of the real picture .
4506,"when they all go boom at once , there are no secondaries ."
4507,"uk = british ua = ukraine see the "" alpha-2 "" column here : but otherwise , yeah ."

4510,guess we're at the stage the russians realize it's been too quiet . meaning at high value targets there are no misses .
4511,"i was thinking the same . there appears , to my very untrained eye , to be two types of explosions . somethings(s ) like fertilizer with orange/rust color and also something producing almost a big , but not as wide-spread source , black cloud ."
4512,thats not how they work
4513,"first , the premise is untenable - there wouldn't be tactical nukes stored in these ammo dumps . those won't leave russia's territory until they are ready to be used . but , if we accept the premise as a hypothetical , then we're looking at "" some , but not much "". you wouldn't want to be downwind without a breath filter for a day or two , or drink water from that area without appropriate precautions for perhaps a week or so , but that would be about it ."
4514,sounds like a catch 69 really where the russians can go fuck themselves both ways
4515,"sounds more like a catch 300 , and if theyre lucky only a 200 ."
4516,thats the way you win wars . repeatedly force your enemy to choose between multiple different bad options .
4517,"except unlike a true catch-22 , russia has one weird trick they can pull . it turns out that fast moving groups of russians can escape this conundrum by traveling either due east or due west . it turns out if you go a certain minimum distance , all of a sudden ukrainian artillery will no longer harm you , and you will be safely among others like you . putin hates this one trick . it sounds very healthy though for all other russians . better than waiting around to see what else might come up ."
4518,scatter all ammo across all fronts and backs . maybe even some sides
4519,"or you know , himars systems with 100+km range ."
4520,"excalibur/bonus and similar rounds , 155mm platforms to deliver them , himars . the more the merrier ."
4521,i think they already have the surveillance part covered ...
4522,they are probably following their supply trucks to the depot and then boom !
4523,looks more like nitric acid for fertilizer exploding with it . hence the pink haze in the cloud ?
4524,i was under the impression that both ukraine and russia rely heavily on trains for long distance transports but i might be wrong .
4525,"yes , the lack and losses of trucks have been a major hindrance to them so far ."
4526,big badda boom .
4527,scrolled back up and waited . damn ! yes !
4528,"i saw a video of these guys kicking arty shells out of the back of a kamaz . this is what you end up with when you send randos with no experience or training , out into an intense conflict zone with high explosives ."
4529,i hope they never learn 
4530,"> what astounds me is theres a way to store ammo so it doesnt all go off russian ammo isn't even safely stored [ in russia , during peace time .]( > 26 may 2011 explosion in an arms depot in the village of urman in bashkortostan . 12 people were injured and 40 buildings damaged . over 2,000 people were evacuated from the surrounding area . the cause was blamed by an official on the "" combustion of gunpowder traces "". > 2 june 2011 explosion in an arms depot near the city of izhevsk . 20,000 inhabitants of the surrounding area had to be evacuated . 95 people were injured in the blast , and two elderly people nearby died of heart attacks possibly caused by the sound of the blast . windows were shattered up to 10 km away . a discarded cigarette has initially been blamed for the blast . > 26 september 2012 explosion at an arms depot 180 km northwest of orenburg killed one officer . just randomly picking three , there are a lot more ."
4531,also western ammo gradually is switched to less sensitive explosives that are supposed to burn out or otherwise not do this
4532,how do you securily store ammo ?
4533,"with that shockwave yes , even a tank could flip like a toy"
4534,either himars or tochka-u . those are the only two systems with the required range to make that hit .
4535,"just a heads up , the raw income number on fossil fuels is * much * higher than what's going to the war : 1 . remove what cost you incurr from shipping fuels . judging by gazproms public numbers that's about 80 %. this number assumes there's no interest payments going on ( due to russias warm relationship with global finance ), and ignores all non operational parts of business . 2 . from the remaining 20 % not everything goes towards russia . ** very roughly ** estimated , gazprom pays somewhere around 15 % taxes . add to that that it directly owns just about half of gazprom , and again assuming gazprom is a perfectly average example of the entire sector , russia receives only about 57 % from those 20 % 3 . russias defense expenditure was at somewhere around 10 %. assuming that doubled due to the war , what's arriving at russia's defence ministry is only 20 % of the 57 % of the 20 %. 4 . corruption is another definite factor over there . good numbers are impossible to come by , i've seen estimates ranging from 10-90 %. remove that from the total . what russia is left with to actually use at the front is much , much less than what it is paid nominally ."
4536,"cut that by an order of magnitude , even standard 155 are around $ 500 , russia could probably produce them under 200 ."
4537,i mean russia could invest everything in perfect infrastructure and education for just 140 million citizen . wasting everything for an anti-nato proxy war and ruining the infrastructure of a small neighboor country is like a slap in the face of the average russian citizen that can hardly make a living .
4538,"i dont want to kill the vibe but the production of standard ammunition and shells is not a problem for russia . getting it safely to the front is , but they can keep up the artillery shell production no problem . advanced ( cruise ) missiles and long range (+ 30km ) accurate weapons , whole other story"
4539,maybe a component of manufacture needs targeting .
4540,> that is over 10 % of russias daily income from fossil fuel sales so thats going to sting . unless their margin is above 10 % that could be eating up all their profit from fossile fuel
4541,the other issue they may start facing is the grooves in the artillery barrels will start wearing out . russian artillery guns can generally fire about 2500 shells before the grooves wear out and they have to he sent back to the factories to be refurbished . if russia has deep stockpiles of artillery they may be able to switch out their guns for ones that havent been used but if they dont have those stockpiles they may start having to take guns away from the front or see their artillery plummet in accuracy .
4542,i heard there are only two steps you can take when the artillery starts coming in . two fucking big ones :)
4543,"now simply called "" island """
4544,cremation service free of charge courtesy of ukraine . bonus : ash scatter service thrown in as bonus
4545,getting killed by something miles above you controlled by someone on the other side of the globe using an xbox controller . it's crazy to think about .

4552,"that's what exploded in beirut right , used for high nitrogen fertilizer . though i can't imagine its explosive properties would be overlooked by russia that would be a little unwieldy as a conventional military asset . if that's the case they were probably just planning on stealing it and exporting it to syria or somewhere ."
4553,isnt that reading the ukrainian as a russian ? otherwise it would be i think .
4554,"so not okay , then "
4555,russia has been known to put military targets in civilian areas because it makes it harder to counter attack without causing civilian deaths .
4556,they are using newest shells meaning they were produced in modern russia ( up to 30 years ). in about month or two they will have to go to the shells that are old and were produced in ussr . those will have some reliability problems . heard this from respected ukrainian tank instructor
4557,"true , good hit though ."
4558,"ammo always has secondary explosions unless its a controlled dems , that was t controlled spectacular though but certainly not controlled"
4559,"yeah , sorry english is not my mother language i speak 5 languages it gets confusing sometimes"
4560,they arent radioactive ? please tell me how they work .
4561,thank you for the well thought out and rational response .

4570,case of suck it and see ?
4571,"200 is dead , 300 is wounded ."
4572,i wonder if there were any ammo techs in the depot . it will be a very bad day for them ...
4573,"most military explosives , rocket fuels and propellant charges contain nitrates or organic nitro compounds etc ., which will create those brown nitric oxide clouds on combustion ."
4574,"they do , very much so , for longer range transport . they don't use them for "" final delivery ""."
4575,"sounds scary , but wouldn't the shells have safeties on ?"
4576,"i can assure you , they are incapable of learning . the only thing that teaches them is death ."
4577,"and regularly replaced . many old explosives get progressively more sensitive over time , and russia has been very bad at replacing old stock ."
4578,lots and lots of concrete
4579,"small lots far enough apart so that one lot exploding doesnt set off the others . holes and berms help a lot . appears all russian ammo is handled individually , not on pallets . so moving them is labor intensive . hence they dont move it often . plus they dont have trucks to keep it moving anyway . they are complete amateurs in this regard as well ."
4580,"only done this for fireworks , but earthen breams . you make little dug-ins separated by earthen walls , and only store so much in each . light roofs ( this can be a tarp for a temporary setup ) on top . that sends any blasts upwards , so they do not spread . and no , this does not take that long to do if you have an army on hand ."
4581,"imo , underground , in small separate stores . obviously they are placing these depots where ever they can find a place . looks like they had a lot of eggs in that basket ."
4582,"russian oil is one of the most expensive to extract at about $ 45 per barrel . [ source ]( without western oil services , producing will both decline and get more expensive . add in that turbines and other machines are sanctioned , its definitely going to get worse ."
4583,keep in mind that before the war that money was being spent elsewhere . so that elsewhere no longer gets the money
4584,"i also consider that russia is going to have to start building weapons like tanks , ifvs , apcs , and transportation equipment as well . their resources are already limited due to sanctions so if they start tossing everything they have and funds at war manufacturing it's really going to hurt their economy and hamper their ability to fund the war ."
4585,"> what russia is left with to actually use at the front is much , much less than what it is paid nominaly that is why i though eu should at least tax russian oil/gas and give the money to ukriane . maybe something as low as 15-20 % it would not break eu economy , it would incentivise saving the ressource and increase demand for competiting oil/gas . and all the money form the tax would negate the advantage russian get form this business because 15-20 % is likely about as much as they can extract to finance their military .. ukraine will be able to buy whatever equipement they think is best and not rely on donations ( slow and unreliable , my understanding only a small share of the military help has been delivered ) and then you would have a massive change in incentive , suddendly selling your fossile fuel will finance the enemy and russia would know in the future that they cannot use fossile fuel revenue to black mail other country if other countries are willing to use those kind of tax trickery please eu do that !!!!"
4586,"i'm figuring average between various types of shells they use , base bleed , rocket assisted , cluster , krasnopol smart shell , etc . as they won't be just using dumb shells . plus factoring in the propellant charge and so on . one krasnopol is 35k and they use a lot in ukraine . given the smart munitions and base bleed shells ukraine is using russia is going to have to make more than dumb shells or they will get countered at ranges they can't reach . the excalibur and base bleed shells and artillery systems ukraine is using them on can shoot 40km or more pinpoint accurate ."
4587,"wait . russia doesnt use 155mm , do they ?"
4588,"the thing is , one of the points of russian propaganda in general and this war is to convince average russian citizen that russia is surrounded by the enemies , so everyone has to tighten their belts and place every bit of their trust into hands of putin , cause he defends their way of life , and don't ask silly questions about human rights , liberties , rights of ownership , why children of putin's buddies , and buddies themselves , prefer to live and get a citizenship of any western countries and etc . it's not about making something better , it's about creating such a miserable circumstances of living that no one in russia would have time or desire to remove putin from power . the idea is to make people into such an apathetic flock that they don't even bother about politics ."
4589,"if russia had chosen to invest this in their citizens , they would have been much better of , but the russia that could have made that choice could not be the russia that has invaded ukraine ."
4590,"unfortunately ru has stockpiles of cruise missiles , from 80's and 90's . including thousands of x-22 . they were mental in producing them since they were low-cost and multirole ( anti-ship primarly ). however they are mostly innacurate , but enough to bomb the cities . as for kalibr , iskander , onyx - whole other story ."
4591,how do you know ? got production statistics ?
4592,"can you produce a shell without a cnc machine ? like are lathes enough ? because a cnc machine is something russia would have trouble sourcing with sanctions ( or keep going ), but lathes from the 1960's are still in use by the west ."
4593,"and no pension for the wifes or mothers , as the men just vanished , so they have obviously just deserted ."

4598,"> isnt that reading the ukrainian as a russian ? it is , but the language used doesn't mean anything . it comes from the heart anyway ."
4599,"yeah , but i would guess the ukrainian forces would avoid those , if they could . and if not , its on the russians ."
4600,"looked pretty controlled to me , they even had a camera set up for the show . kind of reminiscent of those old nuke tests ."

4611,anyone left at remaining ammo depots could have a less bad day and just surrender now .
4612,oh that was during the day and massive aoe . there were many casualties for sure
4613,probably they ran but the shockwave could have taken them if they didnt ran too far
4614,"and how many trucks were parked there , plus how many were incoming or outgoing when it happened ? they're shelling like crazy , which means deliveries are being done constantly . whatever unit was in charge of that dump is now smoke ."
4615,"yes , no , does it really matter ?"
4616,you really going to take that chance ?
4617,""" well , i won't do that again ..."""
4618,difficult to construct at short notice
4619,which means unless you pile up tons of sand bags you can't repurpose an industrial warehouse for ammunition storage . i'd love to give russia shit at every given opportunity but to me it seems like you'd need weeks to build even a semi-safe storage facility
4620,i'm curious whether the concept of ' wet ' storage has either been forgotten or is not feasible . sherman tanks used to store their ammunition in water until needed to prevent cooking off
4621,don't they want strong roofs to stop incoming shells/missiles in the first place ?
4622,"the ex-kgb mafia gang around putin is not going to be happy with the outcome of his ' cunning ' plan . after all it is all about the bottom line . it is whore mother russia , skimming off her natural riches as much as they can . this war is at least partially if not wholly about oil and gas ( in ukraine ). now they lose both sources ."
4623,"non-expert here , but id always understood oil extraction costs were nearer $ 1 a barrel . $ 45 is hard to imagine . 80 %? nordstream 1 is built , operating , and paid for . how could shipping be 80 %? sounds like an accountant cum apologist here ."
4624,less yachts then ?
4625,"an economist estimated that production of various russian consumer and manufactured goods have declined 50-90 % in the first quarter of 2022 . this war is costing russia's military $ 1 billion a day for months , which is why they are only able to afford attacking around lysychansk . russia is broke , running out of munitions and this will end like in 1917 and 1991 the end of russia as we knew it ."
4626,"good . keep your logic train coming . what happens next ? like 1991 when salaries didnt get paid , people stop working , society coagulates and comes to a stop . republics break away ? surely that wont happen again ? putin has a wolf by the tail and doesnt dare let go ."
4627,they literally cant build replacements for most of what theyre losing here . not only is russia currently unable to build tanks they cant even make cars they cannot actually afford this war at all . its emptying their savings account that the ussr left them and theyre forfeiting a large part of their income for the foreseeable future . russia will never recover from this
4628,their ability to pay for something if irrelevant if no one trades with you . theres so much that they can't build without foreign parts .
4629,their missile guidance systems were manufactured in ukraine...awkward .
4630,russia if they are smart they will wilthdraw from the entire ukraine as a good will gesture before russia is totally destroyed .
4631,"no , that may sound practical , but isn't actually a good policy . there are two target dimensions to any tax : to shape behaviour and to generate revenue . we are currently in a global energy shortage ( russia helped exacerbate this , but isn't the only cause^(ie orcs got lucky with their timing )). as a result , sellers can effectively dictate prices . for the eu there is no alternative supply available at the moment . as a result , you can't shape behaviour away from russian energy , as there simply is no alternative in the short term . this also means that any tax would simply be added to the end price eu consumers would have to pay , not costing russia a dime . and here i disagree with you strongly , this would absolutely hurt not only businesses , but especially people severely . we are at a point where not just the poor , but also the middle income group is already struggling to foot the current energy bills . and this would definitely frag businesses , that had to expend all reserves during corona and are now hit by an energy crisis . we are already seeing foreclosures due to this double whammy , if you made it a lot worse that would definitely have an impact . and it would be pretty much pointless . it doesn't cost russia anything . what it adds to ukraine is an instable , probably delayed , revenue stream . meaning you couldn't count on what you'd actually receive month over month . at this point , why not simply fund ukraine directly ? you'd not loose anything but circumvent all the above issues . that is the more more sensible approach and thus exactly what the eu , but also some of its countries like germany is doing . ignoring all the material support , we're taking the simply route of pumping a dimension more money into this war for the ukrainian side than russia can from the trade revenue it receives from us ."
4632,"separate comment to keep the topics apart . ------------- > ukraine will be able to buy whatever equipement they think is best and not rely on donations ( slow and unreliable , my understanding only a small share of the military help has been delivered ) there are a few points to unpack here , revolving around what you mean when you say only a small portion has been delivered ? what ukraine requested ? what the western world is in the process of checking feasibility ? what has actually been promised ? those have unfortunately been thrown together by alot of journalists with more enthusiasm than brain . we have several limitations here of what can be sent when . to start with the western military side : european armies are not on a war footing . meaning they have comparatively very little combat ready equipment . judging by the official list , germany has sent , or is in the process of sending , pretty much every light weapon in the country that hasn't been issued to a specific soldier ( i'll have to ignore other armies here , since i don't know enough about them ). on heavy weapons , besides the agreement not to send specific in service contact line material like tanks , we largely have two issues : first off , we can't actually bring all that much into ukraine . harbour and airports are closed and street capacity is comparatively tiny , meaning everything has to be shipped by rail , which is largely limited by having to retool to a different rail gauges between poland and ukraine . there is a limit of how much can come in per unit of time and weapons are in rivalry with things like ammo , medicine and other humanitarian aid that also needs freight spots . second , heavy system actually involve a lot more than just the vehicle i'm question . building a unit that can use them effectively does take sometimes years even when starting with well trained soldiers . you will have issues when first adapting and alot of these issues will be specific to your specific country . the reason why even proven equipment is always introduced peacemeal in all armies across the globe is precisely that to find the kinks in the system and your whole organisation . and be it just that a specific type of screw isn't commonly used in your country and no shop has the required screwdrivers or that the cleaning agent xy is attacking the specific material your rubber seals use . then there also is the issue of multinational coproductions always having had restrictions that have served in preventing a country going rouge but are now biting us in the butt (--> gepard saga ). on the side of the industry ( excluding the us , which is both sitting on large stockpiles and keeping its lines running precisely due to this ) heavy military equipment is an artisan good , for which production lines aren't kept open without specific orders . meaning it takes somewhere between 24-36 months between a placed order and the first shipment of the batch . this number comes from the german general in charge of reporting on the war directly , as stated yesterday on "" nachgefragt "" on youtube . if the auto translated subtitles are any good i'd strongly recommend watching , there is a lot of detail given . to bring my rambling to a conclusion , everything together means that equipping ukraine with heavy weapons is actually pretty damn difficult , meaning supply will be comparatively slow no matter which way around you take ."
4633,"of course not , it was just to show how much the us spends on a similar dumb round , it would simply be impossible for russia 152 shells to cost 4 times more"
4634,"exactly x-22s aint gonna cut it . good for large recognizable objects , like a ship on open water , but camouflaged ground sites , nope . also easy to detect if you have some awac in the sky , or an advanced anti-air system"
4635,"yes , theyre online . also in an analysis report of the american intelligence . but to give you a perspective ; unguided round $ 800 , excalibur shell $ 87.000 but price isnt production . no . but it indicates how easy it is to make one , especially compared to high accuracy rounds . and the $ 800 rounds are the modern unguided rounds , you can even go lower , but again , accuracy will drop fast . ukraine needs to be flooded with guided rounds and rockets , quality goes over quantity in the long run imo ."
4636,okay sure but there could still be civilian deaths so its not unreasonable to say hope civilians are okay.

4647,"this . plus , frontlines change . a perfect storage facility is of no use if the front has moved 80 miles forward or , on the contrary , sits right on the line of contact . of all the stuff that russians suck at , this is one where the objective constraints are actually formidable ."
4648,"it doesn't take long to dig a big fucking hole and that's basically what you want to store ammo in . a roof , walls and concrete floors are nice to haves , the hole isn't if you want to survive the first artillery strike ."

4650,that wont work for bulk storage . water actually transmits blast * really well *
4651,"it's also for fertile land . ukraine makes a bunch off of crops and having the power to decide where that food goes as oil demand dwindles would have been in putin's best interest . it would also help feed his country a little . not to mention access to the seas . there ' more reasons than oil to want ukraine back in the fold and part of a bigger , more well balanced , and ultimately more powerful russia . now instead of skimming the farms , the farmers are skimming the russian military's tanks ."
4652,"lol , never ."
4653,"plus they are going to have problems with the components that were previously manufactured in country , as i have seen ( weeks ago ), in this reddit , of fires in both the central tyre depot and the only lens manufacturing plant . so if nobody trades with russia , first they will have to build factories , and build up a new supply chain . i don't think any single country can quickly build and operate an entire vehicle supply chain and manufacturing process ."
4654,"> we are currently in a global energy shortage ( russia helped exacerbate this , but isnt the only causeie orcs got lucky with their timing ). as a result , sellers can effectively dictate prices . for the eu there is no alternative supply available at the moment . as a result , you cant shape behaviour away from russian energy , as there simply is no alternative in the short term . it will . by making russian gas less attractive and therefore increasing demand form alternative source . other alternative source will then invest to increase their production ( suddendly they have a competitive advantage ) and eu user will restrict their usage in reaction to price . and ukraine will get financing to support their war effort cancelling the russia advantage . > this also means that any tax would simply be added to the end price eu consumers would have to pay , not costing russia a dime . in the short run it will cost nothing to russia , in the long term it will strongly incentive the phasing out of russian and strongly re-enforce ukraine in the war . it will also send the message that using commodities to force eu to finance their war is ineffective . > and here i disagree with you strongly , this would absolutely hurt not only businesses , but especially people severely . we are at a point where not just the poor , but also the middle income group is already struggling to foot the current energy bills . and this would definitely frag businesses , that had to expend all reserves during corona and are now hit by an energy crisis . we are already seeing foreclosures due to this double whammy , if you made it a lot worse that would definitely have an impact . business will adapt , and increase of 10-20 % of gas price will not kill all business . fossil fuel price volatily has always been far greater than that without dramatic effect . > and it would be pretty much pointless . it doesnt cost russia anything . what it adds to ukraine is an instable , probably delayed , revenue stream . meaning you couldnt count on what youd actually receive month over month . at this point , why not simply fund ukraine directly ? well this would be funding ukraine directly and from russian gas revenue . they would get plaid at their own game i find that idea beautiful , then they will think twice in the future before using eu energy dependance to finance war and aggression . > youd not loose anything but circumvent all the above issues . absolutly not , you would incentive the phasing out of russia energy dependance and completly cancel the financing advantage russia use to bully other country . this can even become some sort of systematic rules so in the future nobody can effectively blackmail eu into financialy support a country into a war it doesnt approve ."
4655,"> to bring my rambling to a conclusion , everything together means that equipping ukraine with heavy weapons is actually pretty damn difficult , meaning supply will be comparatively slow no matter which way around you take . difficult mean only mean costly . thats why funding ukrain effort from russian fossil fuel profit is a great idea . they will choose whatever equipement they want and billions will return to eu/us military industrial complex to finance the increase in production . while i hate that those guys get rich this will strongly de-incentive russia to go-ahead"
4656,there is another factor : china uses 122mm and 152mm shells ( as 155mm in newer systems ). lets hope that china is not supplying shells or this could drag on forever
4657,ah got it . thanks for clarification
4658,hope nasams will be put to work once they arrive in ua ! it sohuld be an easy prey
4659,"don't forget to factor in wear and tear . if you need to shoot a hundred rounds to hit a target your barrels , recoil absorbers , etc are going to die much faster . you need to employ many more soldiers and their respective material , both to operate and to offer security to the battery , due to taking more time and you need to employ much more logistics to feed , supply and move all of those . in effect , the dumb rounds have a high hidden cost associated with them , which brings the actual totals much closer together ."

4665,"western military doctrine has this odd belief that soldiers who are alive continue to serve the cause ; russian military doctrine treats humans as shit - not just the enemy , but their own soldiers . they seem to think that a half-pound of tin medals for the survivors and some patriotic statues are a substitute for a competent , professional , and * breathing * fighting force ."
4666,"british dambuster bomb works the same way , the water accentuate shock from a small bouncing bomb after it sinks to the bottom of the lake at the base of the dam , just needs to crack the dam and water pressure do the rest ."
4667,"i get that transmitting a pressure wave is a thing , but the important question is whether it would reduce the explosive effect to avoid a chain reaction ."
4668,"i'd think the best way is to separate them out this is making me think . the us really doesn't need any protection except from icbms , which is powerful enough to pretty much wipe everything out . i'm sure they do , but it's not as important . mainland europe needs to go through all this . interesting notion ."
4669,"with an educated population any country can start mass production of war machines , it just takes a supply of metal and ingenuity , russia and most countries do not have either !"
4670,"pretty sure the us could , which is how we won ww2 . but there's virtually no other country that could do it in the modern age ."
4671,"i would be very surprised if china isn't supplying those shells . china gets money , russia digs itself into a deeper hole , and the region gets cleared from the influence of one of the bigger players . also cheaper russian oil now and in the future with the possibility of russia becoming a vassal state ."
4672,"frankly speaking , i don't . i feel very much for the innocent civilians that will die from the bombardment , but nasams will be relatively rare , and are exceedingly effective . better to use them on russian fixed wings instead , where any single hit will save a lot more ukrainians then a single missile hit . it sounds terrible , but that's the terrible logic of war ."
4673,nah fuck moving it . it's cheap enough . if the front line moves just put up new stuff . not that i want russia to do that btw
4674,wet doesnt matter . its not black cat fireworks . bullets bombs shells all have metal casings . powder charges are in containers . us ammo is in water resistant containers as well .
4675,"explosives that are flooded sympathetically detonate at twice the distance . it makes things much , much worse ."
4676,"why would china risk sanctions for that ? china knows russia is doomed and they've got pretty much zero reason to jump from the cliff with them . also , after russia's defeat , china will have a strong hand to negotiate their future russian gas import ."
4677,"unfortunately war is mathematics , which helped immensely churchill when hitler decided to start bombard civilias objects in uk .."
4678,"it does not grow there , so it needs to be moved from wherever"
4679,"well were not talking about how us ammo is stored / shipped . but even if we were , many of the us ammo containers are water resistant and not water proof ( which if submerged for say 24hrs at the bottom of a water filled muddy hole - is where the difference is ). which is why the us army manual the field artillery cannon battery atp 3-09.50 publ 2016 , cautions on keeping powder charges etc dry in both wet and even humid environments . as it will degrade the powder . submerged shells have a higher dud rate and even rifle ammo ( more so commercial but to some degree mil ), will have a higher instance of hang fires / failure to fire . now , its known russian arty shells themselves are shipped in just wooden boxes . its also known that russian arty has a considerable amount of duds ( many of which will be due to storage conditions ), but how good do you think their manufacturing tolerances are on sealed containers or rounds to resist 24 hrs being submerged . better or worse than us military .?"
4680,thanks for the education :)
4681,oh i thought you ment deconstruct it to move it . well yeah but it's light enough that you can basically built a whole pb or fob from about 3 trucks worth and a digger .

4911,yeah has to try i guess . his part on remembering history was decent at least .
4912,if it were me id be doing the same . i would not want to be in his shoes right now . thousands of innocent ukrainians will be dead because of some asshole who will go down in the history books with the likes of hitler .
4913,"hotdogs , nachos and popcorn !"
4914,you shoulda seen the failed turkey coup threads in 2016 . live footage of attack helis gunning down civilians . this has been pretty tame so far .
4915,are you ukrainian ?
4916,any word on what travel in/out looks like right now ? are they still able to easily leave ?
4917,"for all those quick to accuse ukraine of ethnic oppression , he's singing in russian . that's how awfully russian speaking minorities are persecuted ."
4918,"these are real people here , people with families and loved ones , people that are just the same as you and me . they shouldn't have to be dealing with this , especially considering no-one other than putin wants this to happen . it's so easy to scroll through this feed and be desensitised towards the ongoing violence but the reality is , if putin does decide to invade , whether its the whole of ukraine or not , there will be a lot of innocent people dead , children left without a family , a nation full of trauma etc . a young man died today and he shouldn't have , i can only hope it was quick , painless and that he is at peace now ."
4919,"he raises a good point about who is next . i mean ukraine already is a buffer nation because it isn't in and won't be allowed to join nato . so if we give russia the eastern half as a supposed buffer state ... then he'll just take another part of another non-nato country as another buffer state . he doesn't actually want buffer states , that's just the excuse he wants you to hear ."
4920,heya right the did receive a security gaurantee
4921,"the city is donetsk , region is donbass . otherwise pretty much accurate ."
4922,olympics about to end
4923,"nothing changed , just the invasion proceeding as planned as the western intel has been telling us all week . we're simply in the endgame now"
4924,"this is my guess : this escalation was always going to happen . other countries releasing their intelligence on the situation helped push back the timeline , as russia tried to pretend they were still interested in diplomacy . russia used this time to accumulate more troops and supplies , and get them into position . once that time was utilized and no one had sent them ukraine all nicely gift wrapped , they moved to the next phase . if we knew war would break out in 2-3 days , what would we wish we had done? this is where they begin refusing diplomatic talks , burning docs , kicking out foreign representatives they dont anticipate being allies , and moving the people they care about away from the front line . now that foreign intelligence has made it clear russia will likely invade anyway and the false flag attempts havent been overly convincing , theyre moving into the invade anyway portion . increased false flag attempts that could double as attacks , etc . russia knows theyre actively invading , theyre waiting for ukraine to catch on ."
4925,that and he wanted to wait for translator because of how important the topic is
4926,automatic machine grenade launcher ? sounds kinda cool
4927,yeah . fits right into their hybrid warfare doctrine . all the while they are creeping their units closer and closer to the ukrainian border .
4928,"tbh , i think given the audience that was a given for even a bad speech ( which it wasn't ). the room is definitely sympathetic to the ukrainians and slightly upset that the best they can do at this point is clap . so clap they will ."
4929,hes very smart as well . he wanted to wait for translator because of how important the topic is . the dude was an actual comedian though
4930,"so they can say "" why is the west supporting nazis ?"". i mean they are already pulling a false flag , might as well go full hog with it ."
4931,hopefully it's a good sign .
4932,"our elders don't think that russia will invade , in any case i'm getting my passports ready to make a run for it to the romanian border"
4933,not moldovan but romanian . people around here think russia is already pissed at us and they might go straight through us if it comes to that . another half of people think the us are going to help in case something happens while the others think the russians aren't as bad as they seem . honestly it's scary .
4934,"before this crisis , we finns weren't all that interested in joining nato . but the numbers are changing . i don't really think that we'll be applying soon though , if sweden decides to apply , we might as well ."
4935,this is actually something that has been debated amongst strategists and policy makers ... what will putin gain/lose ? and generally putin's decision to threaten to invade your country if you think of joining nato is a good reason perhaps you should join nato . ultimately his actions have contributed greatly to an increased sense of shared responsibility amongst nato member countries and reinforced the importance of the decision new members made to join .
4936,russia would be stupid to fully attempt to annex ukraine . by slowly chipping away at former ssr and ' integrating ' the russian people living there back into russia he is attempting to form his own diet ussr .
4937,591 and 975 ? wow . it was 114 and 258 1 week ago . [
4938,"shelling continues , look for talk about the ceasefire breaches . even if nothing major happens this sets a new precedent for the amount of shelling that can be gotten away with"
4939,actually fair enough . i agree with his assessment on that .
4940,"they only relinquished their legacy nukes because of western safety guarantees , so that's not surprising ."
4941,yea i would agree
4942,at this point i don't think a reasonable person could blame ukraine for going that way .
4943,russia made a commitment to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of ukraine russia broke the promise !
4944,not against it . if ukraine are facing nuclear aggression from a nuclear power it deserves a deterrence . ukraine is a major european country .
4945,fair is fair
4946,kinda hard to invade your own territory
4947,you literally cannot imagine the amounts of propaganda they've consumed over the years . i speak russian and it amazes me when i read it .
4948,"which makes no sense because ukraine is calling for the meetings in the minsk format and with russia to discuss the tensions . russians just dismissed with "" ukraine doesn't bring any specific topics for a discussion , we pass ""."
4949,its a society of comfort !
4950,"> hes an it specialist for microsoft . kharkiv , near the russian border , has something like 200,000 it professionals . i work remotely with about 20 of them , and this whole thing has me freaked out for them ."
4951,last week they recommended leaving and reduced embassy staff . today's warning is urgent .
4952,""" ok vlad , will you stand down if we send you pete davidson ?"""
4953,""" i miss the old kanye , straight from the dome kanye , russia go home kanye ."" crisis averted ."
4954,imagine being 18 and being told you have to die for an old man's bitter grudge .
4955,"you have to give russia an incentive not to do it . if you just do the sanctions already they'll go "" damned if i do damned if i don't "" and just go for it ."
4956,"doing sanctions now gives effectively no more threats the west can use against russia . at that point , what else does putin have to lose ? at least the threat of sanctions may make him a bit more hesitant to commit to that hurt , but if he's already hurt he may as well just go for it ."
4957,"> i agree with him , why is the west waiting for russians to destroy ukraine before acting with the promised sanctions . because the prospect of sanctions de-incentivize an invasion . if you implement sanctions prior to the invasion you've burned your deterrent , and essentially green light the attack ."
4958,"tbh , most soldiers without a task and not being able to be anywhere but bumfuck wilderness ... would not say no to a drink if one were to be had . especially if you're also worrying about going into active combat very soon ."
4959,at least they're bagging up their garbage . it's fucking rude to invade a country and just throw your trash everywhere .
4960,"but they were using trash bags , wow ."
4961,who knew the russians liked cookies that much .
4962,"in afghanistan it was cigarette butts , monster energy drink cans and candy wrappers"
4963,"he is throwing down ! yeah , getting chewed-out in person carries a lot more weight than getting chewed out by skype ."
4964,"oh man , what a shit show that was . ruined the vibe of the entire olympics ."
4965,"15 year old kids with 3 different types of heart medication , gotta love the russian cheaters / trainers ."
4966,yeah the cyber attack joke was pretty solid lol
4967,"haven't there been pretty dominant danish , swedish , german/preussian , french , holy roman empire , ottoman , hungarian etc etc empires dominating alot of these areas traditionally . and vikings , romans , tribal horse archers .... before that . so , if anything , the fall of the ussr was a return to normal more than anything else ."
4968,"turns out the whole thing is the ioc's fault . if the world just wouldn't comment on russian cheating or abusing 15 year old girls , vlad wouldn't be so mad ."
4969,"if they extend the olympics , maybe that will stop russia from invading ! quick , think of two more weeks of plausible winter sports !"
4970,yeah he was a little pushy . i hope he ends up okay and makes it safely into the vault .
4971,"i give you an upvote because people forget this then ask why these countries won't help ukraine . money and greed , they can't , they are dependent on russian oil ."
4972,* laughs in french *
4973,"wow , zelensky just dropped the mic on the whole world who signed the treaty ."
4974,he's got us there .
4975,sounds like a long winded way to say ' we'd like our nukes back now please .'
4976,"i posted about this on another thread once , and i was down voted and told that it was 28 years ago and that ukraine should be able to take care of themselves by now . that is their own problem now . apparently , people don't seem to care that we made promises to a country that we will protect them . and it's sad ."
4977,"i was wondering when zelenksy would play the * budapest * card , about time . bravo"
4978,"well , hes 100 % right here"
4979,"i thought this guy was an idiot for going to munich today , but he done played us . bravo , ukraine ."
4980,the unfortunate reality is that ukraine won't have time to redevelop their nukes .
4981,wow thats impressive coming from china
4982,well thats encouraging .
4983,wow i'm genuinely surprised
4984,"lol china is good at speaking out of both sides of their mouth . see taiwan , hong kong ... etc ."
4985,altered footage : this footage is sped up .
4986,ill be dead by tonight !
4987,russia doesn't have enough vodka and i don't have enough liver .
4988,but ... i don't have that much vodka !
4989,"> accidentally fire the first shot i never understood that bit . even if the old guy hadn't , would the orc's have just stood there and not attacked ?"
4990,so saruman send the uruk-hai to helms deep for drills and then when rohan provoked them he had no other option but invade ? 
4991,"awh yeah , filling oceania with troops and collecting 2 troops per turn until overflowing to proceed with a suicide attempt to grab asia . 60 % of the time , it works every time ."
4992,"wait , how do they know that ? what does it mean , tank movements ? or shelling ?"
4993,"the "" separatists "" are mostly just russian soldiers and mercenaries who aren't wearing the russian flag"
4994,no one here knows the answer to that question
4995,"i know some can because i witnessed it back in iraq almost 20 years ago now . but it's not just fuel - like any mechanical and electronic vehicle , especially ones that fly , regular maintenance and preventative maintenance is required . and when you are talking about things that cost as much as they do , and have lots of sensitive equipment in them , you don't want to find out it needed maintenance when it crashes over someone else's territory or international waters ."
4996,uavs dont have in-flight refueling ( ifr ) capabilities .
4997,perhaps for other military aircraft with transponders off ?
4998,the ukrainian president is charismatic af
4999,"yeah it doesnt work , we found that out 80 years ago and shouldnt forget it"
5000,"giving concessions to putin after the crimea crisis would be like someone taking your lunch , then trying to do it again the next day , you confront him about it , he apologizes and offers you to return it in exchange of your dessert and then the both of you are cool . the answer is no , and we still need to talk about crimea ."
5001,certainly looks like aa but who would they be shooting at ?
5002,"most likely yes . let's hope the same logic continues to hold , for the sake of ukraine's people ."
5003,the making public of intelligence as it becomes available is brilliant strategy . it's prevented war so far .
5004,"but thankfully , through these stressful days better help is there when i need it with therapist available 24/hr a day . "
5005,"oh god , is wwiii sponsored"
5006,hit a nerve probably lol .
5007,should have asked them why russia is using belarus in exactly the same way they're claiming nato is using ukraine
5008,"first , iron dome is too costly to actually benefit ukraine . it might work against hamas , but the russian military has capabilities that far outweigh anything the iron dome can stop . second , why would israel want to potentially allow hardware to fall into the hands of the russians who work closely with iran and syria ? and third , why would israel sell to ukraine knowing that would mean russia would further support iran and syria against israel ? the iron dome wouldnt do anything against the overwhelming amount of fire the russians bring to the table ."
5009,why is fox news shelling people ?
5010,fox news has artillery ?!
5011,fox news has artillery now ??
5012,i wasnt able to watch the speech so i appreciate you taking the time and writing this out for us to read
5013,probably . this is a classic way to create a casus belli .
5014,yeah i think that is their plan .
5015,"lol that camera man couldnt give a shit about artillery shells . his reporter is literally sprinting away and he just keeps a calm pace , makes sure to give everyone a nice shot of a burned out truck ."
5016,i think china are pissed russia isn't waiting for olympics to end maybe lol
5017,"i don't think china could survive well economically if the promise to apply the same sanctions to allies was upheld . tbh , i'm not sure europe could do well with those sanctions applied to china either . so , i think they just don't want to get involved ."
5018,china was never exactly thrilled about it . but they usually try to stay out of things that arent their direct sphere of influence . i doubt theyll do more than say * war is bad yo * then use the sanctions to extract trade benefits from russia .
5019,china wants to take over the world via money . if anything they probably think russia is being a bit gauche .
5020,serious support from china was never on the table . interesting to see the change in rhetoric though .
5021,"i think the traduction is "" you fucks , wait for our olympics to end !"" but to be clear , china was never going to send troops there . they were just going to help russia with the trades/economic sanctions ."
5022,"see , that's the trick to his statement . the territorial integrity of every * country * should be supported , but which is a country and which is not ? to the chinese , taiwan is not a country . to the russians , the separatist regions in eastern ukraine are countries . so it depends on what you consider a country . as soon as that changes , so does the statement ..."
5023,going out for some ice cream .
5024,here's a link without ads . fucking wild .
5025,gallows humor .
5026,joking and laughing is a common coping mechanism .
5027,hes got other meetings scheduled . a shit ton i would assume .
5028,kinda . tying europe and russia together economically wasn't a terrible idea to promote peace through economics . it doesn't work though when russia is ruled by an imperialist kleptocratic gangster .
5029,germany moving from nuclear has been disastrous for them .
5030,"short answer , yes long answer , absolutely yes and honestly they should have taken it into account"
5031,italy is far worse
5032,the eu needs to become energy independent .
5033,"maybe not backfired , but definitely people are waking up and able to see through the bs"
5034,"under trump they didn't invade or even threaten to invade ukraine . under obama they invaded , under biden they're threatening . see how easy it is to twist this logic ?"
5035,"anywhere you turn in moscow , it's easy to find members of the russian elite who wonder why the west thinks that war in ukraine is the kremlins preferred course of action . even if the russian army managed to force kyiv into a swift and humiliating defeat without too many casualties , the damage to russias national interests would surely outweigh any potential military gains . the problem is that the same logic was just as true eight years ago when the fateful decisions were made to annex crimea and to stir conflict in ukraines donbas region . the fact that russia has been able to endure the international fallout for all these years helps to explain why the region finds itself again on the brink of war . when it comes to ukraine , people in moscow and the west can be forgiven for assuming that the kremlins policy is informed by a dispassionate strategy derived from endless hours of interagency debate and the weighing of pros and cons . what actually drives the kremlin are the tough ideas and interests of a small group of longtime lieutenants to president vladimir putin , as well as those of the russian leader himself . emboldened by perceptions of the wests terminal decline , no one in this group loses much sleep about the prospect of an open-ended confrontation with america and europe . in fact , the core members of this group would all be among the main beneficiaries of a deeper schism . consider mr putins war cabinet , which is the locus of most decision-making . it consists of nikolai patrushev , the head of the security council ; alexander bortnikov , the head of the fsb ( the main successor agency of the kgb intelligence service ); sergei naryshkin , the head of russian foreign intelligence service ; and defence minister sergei shoigu . their average age is 68 years old and they have a lot in common . the collapse of the soviet union , which mr putin famously described as the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century , was the defining episode of their adult lives . four out of five have a kgb background , with three , including the president himself , coming from the ranks of counterintelligence . it is these hardened men , not polished diplomats like foreign minister sergey lavrov , who run the countrys foreign policy . in recent years members of this group have become very vocal . messrs patrushev and naryshkin frequently give lengthy interviews articulating their views on global developments and russias international role . according to them , the american-led order is in deep crisis thanks to the failure of western democracy and internal conflicts spurred by the promotion of tolerance , multiculturalism and respect for the rights of minorities . a new multipolar order is taking shape that reflects an unstoppable shift in power to authoritarian regimes that support traditional values . a feisty , resurgent russia is a pioneering force behind the arrival of this new order , along with a rising china . given the state of affairs in western countries , the pair contend , it's only natural that they seek to contain russia and to install pro-western regimes in former soviet republics . the wests ultimate goal of a colour revolution in russia itself would lead to the countrys conclusive collapse . washington sees unfinished business in russias persistence and success , according to mr putins entourage . as americas power wanes , its methods are becoming more aggressive . this is why the west cannot be trusted . the best way to ensure the safety of russias existing political regime and to advance its national interests is to keep america off balance . seen this way , ukraine is the central battleground of the struggle . the stakes could not be higher . should moscow allow that country to be fully absorbed into a western sphere of influence , russias endurance as a great power will itself be under threat . on a personal level , the world view of the hard men is an odd amalgam of soviet nostalgia , great-power chauvinism and the trappings of the russian orthodox faith . the fact that the new elite in kyiv glorifies the ukrainian nationalists of the 20th century and thumb their noses at moscow is a huge personal affront . why then are the people around putin not scared about possible fallout from a new round of far-reaching economic sanctions ? in their eyes , the sanctions that the west imposed to punish russia for the annexation of crimea and the war in donbas were intended largely to check russias rise . america and its allies would have found a way to introduce them one way or another , they were just looking for an excuse . since 2014 such views have solidified . messrs patrushev , bortnikov and naryshkin all find themselves on the u.s . treasurys blacklist already , along with many other members of mr putins inner circle . there is no way back for them to the wests creature comforts . they are destined to end their lives in fortress russia , with their assets and their relatives alongside them . as for sanctions by sector , including those that president joe bidens team plans to impose should russia invade ukraine , these may end up largely strengthening the hard mens grip on the national economy . import substitution efforts have generated large flows of budget funds that are controlled by the coterie and their proxies , including through rostec . the massive state conglomerate is run by a friend of mr putins from his kgb days in east germany , sergey chemezov . in a similar vein , a ban on food imports from countries that have sanctioned russia has led to spectacular growth in russian agribusiness . the sector is overseen by mr patrushevs elder son dmitry , who is mr putins agriculture minister . similarly much-touted financial sanctions have led to a bigger role for state-owned banks which , unsurprisingly enough , are also filled with kgb veterans . if anything , further sanctions wouldnt just fail to hurt mr putins war cabinet , they would secure its members ' place as the top beneficiaries of russias deepening economic autarky . the same logic is true of domestic politics : as the country descends into a near-permanent state of siege , the security services will be the most important pillar of the regime . that further cements the hard mens grip on the country . after two years of covid-induced self-isolation for kremlin bosses , there is a clear tendency toward tunnel vision and a dearth of checks and balances . russias interests are increasingly becoming conflated with the personal interests of the people at the very top of the system ."
5036,"yea paywall , i'm genuinely interested in this ."
5037,yes . invading from east ? super gay .
5038,yooo easy man . lets keep this civil

5068,"i think fox just tells conservatives what they want to hear , and their brains have been rotted by facebook etc ."
5069,"that's been the policy in russia for years . putin signing that doc is something he does every year . the rule is that conscripts can't be deployed outside of russia , only professional soldiers can be used offensively . you've probably heard of the terrible hazing issues russian military has dealt with , that's all amongst the conscripts . conscription does suck though . it's just not a big factor in all of this ."
5070,they clearly view scholz as the weakest link to kowtow to them .
5071,"russia's just trying to play on the hypersensitivity of germany to the issue and the paranoia that they may , even unintentionally , aid and abet such acts ( which , to be clear , is entirely understandable on the part of germany ) to try to get them to refrain from committing to a side out of a fear that they may be wrong about the facts ."
5072,just throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks . finding that casus belli is getting real pathetic tbh

5080,nope that's genuine . lufthansa suspending flights from kiev between 21-28feb
5081,russia has 200k troops along the border and are doing their best to instigate a war or manufacture evidence to support one . fighting has gotten gradually more intense . its unlikely to spill over into the rest of europe
5082,russia is threatening to take over ukraine . russia is denying it but western intelligence keeps suggesting otherwise . no you dont need to worry . maybe dont take a commercial flight to ukraine and you will be fine . russia abs nato will attempt almost everything to not go to war with each other .
5083,"russia prefers the nations on its borders to be fragmented and geopolitically weak and beholden to russian leadership . they foment rebellion , magnify local disagreements between causes , and will push for corrupt leadership in those countries . russia sees ukraine as a former client state which broke free of their control . they are supporting the separatist movements in eastern ukraine ( also home to much of ukraine's industry ). russia also invaded ukraine an seized the crimean peninsula in 2014 . expectations are that russia will recognize the ' independence ' of the separatist regions and potentially absorb them into russia , or establish them as semi-autonomous nations similar to belarus . at the minimum this would cripple ukraine financially and effectively neuter them as a country . ( the west of ukraine is highly agrarian and not competitively economically ). it is also possible that russia will seize the rest of the land surrounding mauripol and cutoff ukraine from the black sea . a landlocked ukraine with the eastern regions removed would basically be a financially strapped country ripe for easy manipulation via corruption , restriction of access to ports , etc ."
5084,"sure , you got 10-15 years ?"

5101,mk19 belt fed 40mm automatic grenade launcher has been a thing for a while . i'm an expert because i played cod4
5102,"probably an mk-19 . i got to shoot these a few times in the marine corps . the training rounds are hilarious , they are dummy grenades that explode into a puff of orange dust . we called them cheeto rounds . shooting the live rounds can only be described as orgasmic . in that moment you are a god ."
5103,"when i was there in 2015 for an army(former american soldier here ) mission , i was talking to some locals and they where asking if america had their back . i said oh yea , were here to show were not fucking around . as a romanian born myself , my ass is flying back if shit goes down . i get being scared but romania is nato , and are actually very capable than what they where before . even the moldovans trained with us too ."
5104,western and russian guarantees
5105,that's literally human civilization -> today . that's why it's so important for the free world to resist this attack on our values .
5106,"so sad , i feel so sorry for all those boys who see their future torn apart , fathers who will have to separate from their children with the anguish of never seeing them again , forced to leave and maybe not to come back just because someone higher than them wanted to do so . damn sad ."
5107,this is true . us marine combat vet here . once in a while our co would have beer flown out to our out fob . it would be gone by the next day .
5108,"it's always been their play . if they can't win legitimately , cheat . if they still can't win , at least ruin it for everyone else ."
5109,don't blame the kids . they're children under the sway of fully responsible adults . it's their trainers/handlers that deserve the condemnation . the children deserve our sympathy .
5110,until the interviewer ruined it with the insulting how about i talk and youll understand me 
5111,uhh uuuhhh uuhhh broomball ! ice pick throwing ! uuhh uhh 8 person bobsled ! uhh 250km cross country skiing

5119,i love this name .
5120,you dont know that - maybe theyre doing zelenskys whole life .
5121,"they did , and they denied it back then like they're denying it now . no matter how much proof there was : camo only used by russian military , weapons only used by russian vdv troops and internal troops , russian passports on captured soldiers , video of a russian aa battery quickly pulling out after shooting down the malaysia plane , russian army rations on captured "" russian "" checkpoints , brand new t-72's captured . they'll lie like they always do and point the finger at us ."
5122,"china sees taiwan as a rebelling province , so yes ."
5123,"i agree with you on that , but china would respond with taiwan is not a country , but part of china so it doesnt count . ( again this is not my belief )"
5124,"mr . lahey , not another night of the shit abyss"

5129,thats a good point . never thought of it like that . youve opened my mind on this issue
5130,"little bit of a , little bit of b ."
5131,"in a pure war context ? no , because nobody would beat nato without use or nuclear weapons ."
5132,"hoping for the best for you guys , must be terrifying to be there rn . give putin hell"
5133,im sending good vibes your way . not that its much of anything . my heart goes out to you and everyone else there .
5134,yo . that was very reassuring and nice . appreciate the kind words and thank you for your service kind man .
5135,seriously fuck that russian coach . it's almost a certainty none of these girls will be in the next olympics because of how brutal the training is .
5136,"yeah , more like dont fuck with our sovereignty as we bomb our province into submission "
5137,was the sentence in quotes what he actually said ?
5138,"we will , it's kinda our thing ) it's weird to be here , for sure"

5140,"it's quieter than usual , but bars are full today ( we have great bars in kyiv ) some people i know with small children left or temporarily relocated them to the west of the country the rest of us bought some buckwheat and some ammo and is planning to watch this shitshow from the front row sits"
5141,"dear god , be safe , holy fuck !"

5147,"be safe , stay strong !"
5148,"if a ukrainian is telling me not to panic , i will take their word for it . let us know when to panic"
5149,"never before did i think i would give a shit where the russian ministry of emergency situations ' plane was , but here we are ."
5150,"people are acting like theyre owed an invasion , not realizing that publishing putins plans was an attempt at making him reconsider "
5151,live thread updates with soviet antheme are vastly out of context regarding that the dj played all sorts of anime shit and rick astley before . at best that is very misdirecting
5152,"war or no war , these webcams are telling me a lot about ukranian driving . no one uses an indicator and they drive up to junctions way too quickly...tut tut"
5153,"what i don't see people mention too much is the russians have brought supplies and materials that they don't usually bring for war exercises . things like ; blood banks , field hospitals , and equipment to make bridges . jets and tanks you see all the time but the finer detail things you need to logistically wage a war are there ."
5154,i've at least been able to have a nice peaceful evening watching a city sleep . i'm going to have to start putting on city live streams while i read .
5155,"hey , redditors , ukrainian is here . since kyiv isn't on the border , but there were news , that the first cities to be attacked are the ports on the black sea , you can check a channel with a lot of online cameras in odessa - it has higher chances to be the aim than the capital , i bet . not the advertisement but the advice . and also it is more relaxing and interesting than a regular kyiv view everyone knows from any kyiv-related news . edit : to note , odessa is the third city by population in ukraine ( approx . 1 mil people , to compare with 2.8 mil in kyiv ). so it is a possible and valuable target . [ 3:37 ] - it is still quiet here , thanks everyone for their support !"
5156,this is like a fucked up version of a new years countdown
5157,friendly reminder to check account age on people in this thread
5158,"> literally almost every ukrainian government website is down tonight . even zelenskys website is down . this was pretty shocking to read . the sites seem to largely back up now , but i just tried the president's site and it was very slow to load . a cyber attack doesn't necessarily mean an invasion is coming ... but if he were to invade , it would start with a cyber attack . interesting feeling knowing when i wake up in the morning it might have already begun ."
5159,"claims that russia has [ built a pontoon bridge across the pripyat river ]( about 4 miles from ukraine . yes , that pripyat ."
5160,current status : all ukrainian websites that were down during the cyberattack are now back up .
5161,i keep seeing brand new accounts claiming to be living in kiev and hearing explosions and gunshots . this is almost certainly bullshit .
5162,is this thread just unmoderated ?
5163,i came here looking for news and it's one giant shitpost . why am i not surprised ?
5164,"pretty wild that war is just now a thing people can watch on live streams and then start complaining / posting memes in the chat when nothing happens for an hour or so . imagine reddit during ww1 , "" lol western shills really think that austria-hungary is gonna invade serbia , ever heard of posturing ?"" "" kaiser wilhelm is a punk bitch , no way he actually tries to take paris ."" "" yawn , another day of them just sitting in the trenches . do something already !"""
5165,whether or not there is military aggression by russia against ukraine ; putin is a rat fucking bastard .
5166,"now to be fair , had something happened exactly at 3am how many of you would have legit panicked"
5167,biden : what a stupid idea . who wants an invasion at 3 in the morning ? putin : oh boy 3 a.m .!
5168,this thread feels like an episode of black mirror
5169,what if this whole thing is an elaborate promotion for flightradar24 .
5170,if russia doesnt show up for 15 minutes we are legally allowed to not participate in war
5171,"[ the sort of shit russian bots are peddling on twitter , my fucking lord even has "" liberation "" and "" provocations "" in the title of the tweet"
5172,this thread is rapidly descending into pure shitposts .
5173,"my second and last update boys : still everything is fine though i think i would notice something due to the fact that i live in a big port city the black sea . so it's time to go to bed , at least for me , after all it's 3 am here . good night reddit !"
5174,"if we can just get airtags on the russian tanks , then we could stop watching these dang drones ."
5175,this thread is now plane talk and i'm all for it
5176,"came here for updates on russia/ukraine , all i've gathered so far is that we stan forte the plane . i'm cool with that . edit to correct myself . forte is no ordinary plane although we would all love her even if she was , she is a drone ."
5177,"us to retaliate for russian cyberattacks , force them to use comcast ."
5178,6000 redditors used to doom scroll here . now its a clown town
5179,mfs in this thread really dont know the russian national anthem is just a variation of the ussr anthem .
5180,i think this sets a record for the most people that have ever listened to a word that the mirror has said .
5181,"just watching this vid , kyiv is really quite pretty"
5182,i wouldnt be able to sleep a second if i lived in ukraine . please let nothing happen
5183,"jokes aside , the live thread has a tweet about all government websites being down . has this been confirmed anywhere else ?"

5185,thread reminds me post 2020 election threads with everyone shit posting for three days while waiting for the counting to complete . good old map boy .
5186,"this comment thread is going through several stages of memes , seriousness , and what the fuck is going on ."
5187,"if putin hasn't arrived in 15 minutes , are we allowed to leave ?"
5188,the homer32 that just turned off its callsign over the black sea is a manned surveillance aircraft . is probably has an escort that was refueled by the lagr tanker that is now heading back .
5189,why is the pakistani airforce in southern belarus ?
5190,this whole thread reads like a twitch chat .
5191,hopefully there will be no war .
5192,"my wife goes , "" why are you watching a video of a public square with space jam playing "" and when i said , it's the reuters stream in ukraine she goes , "" uh-huh okay """
5193,anyone else find it incredibly difficult to focus on other things while this is going on ?
5194,i don't think the point of a 3am invasion is to telegraph it to the whole world before it happens
5195,"psa : there was actually a person in the bottom left corner of the screen flashing a light in what looked remarkably like morse code . it was not the cop car . afaik though , the rickrolls and send nudes being posted are redditors being cheeky"
5196,"new dumb countdown time for reddit to hype is apparently 10am according to this stream : [ reasons : \- "" ukraine leadership wants the whole country to come together and sing the national anthem at 10am ."" \- "" russia has a history of launching attacks at 10am "" no logic or proof behind any of this that i am aware of ."

5199,"im just glad for the friends ive made along the way . jake , forte , that ukrainian police circling helicopter , even evac01 for a brief time"
5200,can anyone tell me what the point of monitoring air traffic is ? are we looking for an influx of russian military aircraft or a lack thereof ?
5201,"i know the flight tracking is obnoxious , but anyone else notice the huge us drone is keeping well clear of not only the donbas region , but kharkiv . i'm sure at 50,000 feet it can see a lot , but it being publically available and steering clear leads me to believe the us is basically saying "" don't cross this line "" and/or they don't want to provoke an anti air missle since it would change this from sabre rattling to full-on war ( or at least a response )."
5202,"looks like russian air force activity near georgia right now , and in belarus south of mogilev . they're only partially being seen on fr24 , probably more activity with transponders shut off . ra26039 could all be part of the excercises"
5203,imagine the war getting live-streamed . the internet is so fucked up theres gonna be memes during the invasion
5204,i hope this is the most boring night of my life
5205,"writing this comment from odessa ( which is a a big ukrainian city ), no explosions yet . everything seems fine ."

5215,did forte11 leave already ?
5216,"honestly , the planespotting in this thread doesn't bother me too much . very interesting to see so many people poring over it . it's the dumb jokes that are clogging up the thread"
5217,4 different angles plus flights
5218,heres to hoping putin has reconsidered or was always planning on just using the build-up as an intimidation tactic . not sighing a breath of relief until most of the forces there back off though .
5219,man i am never reading news off of reddit ever again
5220," we love you , ukraine ! "
5221,maybe the real russian invasion was the friends we made along the way . or the existential threat of escalating into nuclear theater . but also friends .

5223,i can't believe the mirror lied to us
5224,whens steiners counter attack gonna come ?

5250,"if russia was a fair and free democracy , instead of a criminal mafia state , with a dictator at the helm , many eastern european states would have naturally gravitated towards a successful and prosperous russia . the reason they've aligned with the west isn't that they're pro-us , it's because they don't want to be mugged and destitute and a victim of putin and his den of thieves ."
5251,did he just say fuck jerry ? edit : someone has definitely figured out theres a feed going on .

5313,* careless whisper starts playing *
5314,why is everyone in the comments acting like just because nothing happened at 3 am that that means the invasion is never going to happen ??
5315,"total absolute hypothetical ; isnt it kinda crazy how literally one fucking guy , for example , putin or jinping could theoretically just feel suicidal , wake up one day , create a false flag , and decide to more or less end the world by emptying there silos on there opps ? and then there rivals retaliating by doing the same , ending each other . how did we get to the stage where one man could create so much chaos ?"
5316,russia : we don't want to be neighboring a nato country ! also russia : let's invade a nato neighboring country and become nato neighbors

5319,imagine thinking russia wasnt going to invade bc it didnt happen at some unverified specific time
5320,praying i don't wake up to either russia or ukraine as the 1 trend in twitter
5321,"been following this situation for a while now . the interesting take is that russia keeps forces massed for several months , waiting for the right justification/opportunity . the downside to russia doing that is it permits ukraine more time to recieve advanced arms and entrench . russian casualties will be significantly higher the longer they wait . you can think its a bluff , but with 70 % of the russian military around ukraine , it doesnt make much sense ."
5322,fly dubai yolo

5346,"i would like to gauge an opinion here . the russian eu ambassador says there will not be a conflict . there is a chance he is lying , but the words are notably direct . i see both for and against in this thread . is he likely lying ?"
5347,russia's air force one transponder is off finally from what i see .
5348,6 am wenedsday in ukraine .
5349,looks like the tanker did what it came to do .
5350,lagr getting that good air refueling track started for homer . thats my guess .
5351,lagr and homer are gonna make a baby
5352,its as tense as a putin bare back horse ride ..
5353,stay strong ukraine !
5354,"i think the music is clearly being played by some random civillians , probably as a joke , and not a sign of an imminent invasion necessarily lol"
5355,i pray for everyones safety . i just spent 3 months in ukraine at the end of last year . was at independence square . so surreal . beautiful city . the ukrainians are strong and nice people . i really hope theres no bloodshed .
5356,"appreciate the people posting the flight radar links , really interesting stuff"
5357,"at this point i'm just praying it will stay local and not devolve into a global conflict or worse . it feels like it's more than likely going to happen . i just wish for everyone involved , especially the ukranian people , that it is as minor as possible . politics and power are awful things , but death is worse ."
5358,bro there is straight up a guy flashing morse code
5359,"i live near an airport in poland and for the past two weeks i've seen nothing but military aircraft fly in , maybe one or two ryanairs ."
5360,did they know they can just 1v1 on rust instead ?
5361,"i feel so bad for the people in ukraine right now , they are probably so terrified . hoping nothing happens ."
5362,a reminder that a very important flight wouldnt be publicly viewable on flight tracker 24
5363,the russians built a bridge
5364,a group of birds is called a flock . a group of geopolitical experts is called a subreddit .
5365,should honestly close the thread until something happens . just useless trolling and plane tracking now
5366,"if i learned anything about anything today , its planes , drones , names of cities in ukraine , and that you guys love to upvote . thanks for the karma , same time tomorrow , yeah ?"
5367,the fuck happened to this thread ?
5368,anyone else notice the guy to the left by the stairs flashing his light . morse code ?
5369,"i dont know why russia would have transmitters on their presidential plane , but it is interesting if thats true . like after 9/11 the safest place for bush to be was in the air"
5370,"my wife is russian and she is the sweetest person in the world ( we live in usa im american ) but all of those poor people over there are brainwashed into thinking that ukraine is the bad guys . the younger generation and their access to western news and information , i hope will save that nation . i love the russian people they are so nice but that government is ass backwards and thats coming from a sad american ."
5371,"someone just yell "" fuck jenny ?"""
5372,are any ukrainians here as well watching ?
5373,happy new year !!
5374,the cop car is back
5375,but they never specified what 3am . 3am kiev ? 3am hawaii ? d :
5376,can somebody fill me in on what this morse code is that everybodys talking about
5377,why are we posting morse code ?
5378,some of the ra planes at moscow airport soon to takeoff ?
5379,tension ? what tension ?? - putin
5380,"people on live stream saying [ is putin's plane , where a bunch of other russian airforce planes on the ground ."
5381,why did this thread pick up so much in the last 5 minutes
5382,a lot of russian airforce activity at moscow
5383,war is hella flightradar24 reports
5384,"ukraine and belarus airspace completely empty outside of the drones flying around , also ministry of emergency services ( russian ) aircraft heading out of crimea to ?"
5385,lj60 what are you doing ?
5386,i wonder what off-grid jets that stratotanker must be refuelling doing those circles .
5387,let's hope the rumors of an invasion on feb 16th don't happen . hoping for a solution to this
5388,what i wanna know is how are you guys finding these planes ? theres thousands on that flight radar website
5389,lets see what happens this evening
5390,"people very fixated on a supposed deadline ( 8 pm est ) that has only been attributed to anonymous sources , and even if accurate might have been changed after it was reported . russia might invade tonight , tomorrow night , next week , or never ."
5391,maybe it's a lag ... happens to me on warzone all the time
5392,that learjet just hauling ass straight across the middle of ukraine ...
5393,"tell me why my brain read "" live threat """
5394,hiding the score on new posts makes it harder to tell which are fake
5395,invasion has started and the crisis has been avoided are two comments that were above and below each other on this thread . jesus christ lmao .
5396,"someone is doing a live stream of flightradar . buddy , youre not gonna see shit on there ."
5397,fuckin gorbachev is still alive ? imagine being him watching putin trying to create a dollar store soviet union after 30 years
5398,the morse code guy was saying long live ukraine on repeat
5399,this russian ministry for emergency situations plane sum9603 is flying slow as fuck . wikipedia says it has a cruising speed of 430-470 knots . it's been travelling at 125 knots this entire time .
5400,american air assets enroute to an unknown destination : [ [ [ [ [ [
5401,"im going to sleep well knowing forte11 is out there , taking it easy for us sinners ."
5402,"forte11 has more than 10,000 active trackers right now"
5403,my girl came in wearing bell bottom jeans and a turtleneck and im waiting for updates on russia potentially fucking up eastern europe . what year is it ? 1975 ?
5404,"can we all agree that these are real people under threat of invasion . it's not some random ass larp that you can all get excited about . it very well could still come of course , but those people who seem so let down about no war are just....kinda sick ."
5405,"im just assuming every username with "" _ "" or ""-"" and 4 digit numbers at the end = bot"
5406,false start . offense . 15 yard penalty . 1st down .
5407,imo the cop car singlehandedly scared away putins forces
5408,why is the live thread just reposting already disseminated stories and headlines like the abc one and bidens speech . if there is nothing new to report there is no need to start recycling stories to make it look like something new just came out .
5409,do you ever wonder if this thread could be used in a history class one day ? this is just one of the many examples the internet had to say about the event. 
5410,im starting to wonder if russia has kompromat on tucker carlson . his pro russian rants on fox news seem to be getting worse and worse
5411,i guess this is the t-2 hour thread ? i would have waited a little longer to start this one
5412,i mean are we expecting russians to show up at the square at 3 am or what ?
5413,so what are the chances that russia will back off at 2:59:59 and act like ukraine was being ridiculous ?
5414,"u/meizas pointed out to me , the [ russian presidential plane ]( on the [ tarmac ]("
5415,hello this is vladimir * u.s military encrypted
5416,[ this aint no training excersise lol
5417,some people really believe they can track all aircraft during a war on a website lmao
5418,man this thread is a cesspool .
5419,"armchair generals , please refrain from leaking strategies . putin might be reading this thread"
5420,turns out the real invasian were the friends we made along the way .
5421,"squidward : this is stupid , who starts a war at 3 in the morning? putin : oh boy , 3am! edit : thanks for the silver :)"
5422,y'all acting like putin was going to click next turn at 3am and some instantaneous conquest of ukraine would kick off lmfao again with the tabloids profiting from situations like this
5423,forte11 is a good boy who will get a new hellfire missile toy when he gets back to the hangar
5424,can we talk about what details the diplomatic talks are making progress on ? is it weapons ? is it ukraine not entering nato ? what about opening up the canal to give crimea water ? where is the real progress ?
5425,the time in kyiv is presently 1:23am - 8 hours ahead of cst
5426,what's the significance of that plane ?
5427,"right ? like...taking for granted that the invasion plan claim is legit , making them public would be with the desire to prevent that from happening ."
5428,"it's not just making him reconsider , it's making him question russia's ability to plan and execute military operations without warning . he's got to know that western intelligence has worked its way deep into his war machine . that's why the western releases of russian intentions have enough details in them for putin to know we have the inside story , but not enough for him to figure out how we know it . he has to be questioning whether his secrets really are still secret right now ."
5429,that plus biden's very strong speech today amount to very clear efforts to force a reconsideration .
5430,i have never wanted to be wrong about something so much in my life . i hope russia blinked and we're done .
5431,that's how many people drive in eastern european countries .
5432,this all costs an ass ton of money just to be flexing . i fully believe they'll invade .
5433,yeah its weirdly soothing
5434,"it's something i do while working , putting up a live stream from somewhere on my second monitor , quite relaxing . the one of sydney harbour is gorgeous"
5435,i hope nothing happens and you have a completely normal regular day tomorrow .
5436,"thank you and stay safe . despite what seems like people counting down in here or memeing , i think what everyone is feeling is apprehension and not knowing how to deal with it . hearts are with you ."
5437,"thanks friend , stay safe"
5438,thanks for the info !
5439,ukraine stay strong !! i pray for you
5440,doomsday clock .
5441,"and it's important to note that the cyber stuff has been off and on all night , so i think they did some dry runs to get it sorted out for a full shutdown of government services ."
5442,and its 1am
5443,"50,000 people used to live herenow its a ghost town ."
5444,little victories !
5445,seems that way . imagine trying to moderate this mess .
5446,"autistic teenagers . the only good thing i found out of this was flight radar , which is a really cool site . otherwise it's slightly cancerous"
5447,people took picnics to watch the first battles of the us civil war
5448,i hate that . honestly . i love the aspect of having so much information and being able to see what really goes on but i hate the fact of people making jokes of this when others are about to have their entire lives uprooted .
5449,lmfao i've been thinking the same thing . some people are genuinely concerned here . i'd imagine a significant amount are just here for entertainment though .
5450,"i've been drafted into the army . fs in the chat , bois"
5451,probably would have been quite surprised it was so on the dot .
5452,the fact that the 2 most tracked plane ( 7.5k + people tracking it ) on flightradar24 right now is a random passenger flight from an sharm-el-sheikh to kharkiv is super amusing to me for some reason .
5453,the russian invasion and the hunt for brian laundrie brought to you buy flightradar24.com
5454,interesting ? it is the only flight tracking site i have seen that is show the forte11 drone over ukraine . all the others don't show it .
5455,if all our politicians dont show up for 15 can we legally be allowed to finally have some world peace and functional democracy ? i hope so
5456,i keep wondering - who is the audience for this ? its such obvious hogwash .
5457,good luck !!
5458,good night and good luck
5459,"sleep well , i don't think any side really wants the worst ever ."
5460,"good night , i hope things will calm down in the next few days for all you ."
5461,stay safe please !
5462,i've been looking for that myself . i have no idea why it's significant
5463,login to your iblyat account and select find my tank
5464,forte11 superiority . brave drone
5465,that has to be a war crime
5466,cruel and unusual punishment .
5467,thats actually jacksonville fl
5468,they're back up now but trying to go to them earlier showed they were down .
5469,oh no . oh no . oh no no no no no ( explosions in video background ).
5470,"oh , he was a looker , that map boy . "
5471,giving his life for pakistan
5472,i just pictured this as a randy marsh and sharon conversation
5473,"yes , i'm trying to sleep . i live in odesa ."
5474,yeah . somehow im supposed to working right now but all i can focus on is this . im pretty fucking worried and im in australia .
5475,yes ! i honestly have no idea how i'm gonna finish this open heart surgery
5476,the us telegraphed it to dissuade russia
5477,"10 as in 10-4 as in "" 10 is a good time 4 invasion """
5478,"that's forte , unmanned surveillance drone . our new best friend . interesting new trajectory though ."
5479,"14,154 mi , 32 hour range/endurance , just cruising ."
5480,it's just kind of fun to find an interesting flight and check on what it's doing every 30 minutes
5481,during desert storm the air defense of baghdad was live streamed around the world . that was in jan 1991 .
5482,what else are they to do ? hide ? it's not like the russians will immediately teleport to kyiv .
5483,they are actually doing something like this in georgia . a slowly moving front line .
5484,"and repainting the white line where the border is , a few feet back each night ."
5485,hear theyre swapping out street signs and their directions also . my sources say they are painting tunnels on walls too
5486,no . anything actually worth nothing youll see as breaking news on major media outlets . theyre going to know before 15 year old redditors will
5487,no one knows . given the force posture from russia it could honestly happen at any point .
5488,* hes going the distance *
5489,seems really strange for a presidential plane to flying with a transponder on given the circumstances
5490,yeah its heading home if you want two to watch theres a raf river joint that just entered ukraine and a russian air force ilyushin about to enter belarus
5491,seems to be on its way home . it's been a long day .
5492,plane spotting is just fun in general
5493,if you get the fr24 app you can point your phone camera at the sky and it'll highlight planes when you look at them
5494,looks like hes already laying the groundwork for that in the media right now
5495,"right , this thread is insane"
5496,go to smokes or something then .
5497,you forgot the part about twitter
5498,us is reporting that russia has left large amounts of their own borders virtually unguarded to put their troops where they have . their northern and southern borders are both wide open . i totally agree .
5499,"like being infront of a tiger and you just keep staring at each other for 10 min , then you think "" he's not gonna do anything "" and turn your back on him . until russia pull their troops off the border , there's possibility for the worst ."
5500,"oh forte , our new best friend . people have shorter relationships than this sub has with forte"
5501,"ra is just the prefix for all russian registered planes , same as n for american and c for canadian . an ra plane taking off from a russian airport is completely normal"
5502,"no war , go to sleep"
5503,"some tiktoks of some tanks moving , and some reports of a temp bridge being built on the way to the ukraine border . other than that this stream has been lost to the emperors light and descended into the grip of the ruinous powers ."
5504,you may have prevented ww3
5505,a shame putin is way too insecure for that ..
5506,"it's not 3am , its arma3 , was a typo"
5507,good night wesley
5508,doh
5509,a singapore airlines flight just left sydney what can this mean
5510,lmao so accurate
5511,none of these people are aware that us planes have been flying these patterns for months/years over ukraine . lmao . this is literally a daily thing .
5512,"i was given the privileged access codes to the flightradar website through years of trust building and expertise . don't make a mockery of me or my work . the reddit intel , defence , investigation , operations taskforce squadron ( aka reddit i.d.i.o.t.s ) are no laughing matter . we risk our lives sitting down checking on a 2 seater 1980s plane flying in the democratic republic of congo ."
5513,probably if you are no where near the shit going down .
5514,i find it eerie
5515,"if putin doesnt show up 15 minutes after the bell , ukraine is legally allowed to leave"
5516,i think he can actually be up to 15 minutes late . otherwise he legally has to cancel the war .
5517,the real invasion is all the friends we made along the way
5518,fucking hell 
5519,nobody has to . the answer is always the same . sad and incredibly horny
5520,lot of jets with no callsign appeared .
5521,probably a small drone . 94kts is very slow for an airplane .
5522,i know people joke about the flight radar stuff but this is slightly interesting
5523,"toto , it's called an invasion . we went invading ."
5524,f1 ukranian gp confirmed
5525,didnt a lot of airlines say theyre gonna not fly over ukraine atm due to the invasion fears and tensions
5526,mmmmmmmm .... yeah .
5527,even if russia invades it'd still take a day or two to get to kiev lol
5528,"imagine the citizens of kiev ... just fucking disheartening . it could be wiped off the map in minutes , and nobody could stop it ."
5529,most of us are not in terror . we feeling tired and angry .
5530,"their military , both command and field troops in their own way , must be sweating rivers right now"
5531,"screaming "" for the horde !!!!!"""
5532,"hey , thatd take care of a lot of problems pretty quickly ."
5533,> ~~ hypersonic ~~ supersonic .
5534,it's just a prank bro
5535,warmongers hate this one weird trick
5536,hahahahaha this actually funny
5537,50/50 . itll definitely have massive economic impacts due to sanctions
5538,"we has the wrong timezone , it's the other 3 am ."
5539,"because everyone knows that if you're late to the bike rack , you're too chicken to show up ."
5540,"in all likelihood they dont want to integrate ukraine into their territory , but install a puppet government thatll just do what they say and let them rob the country blind . a buffer state with benefits basically ."
5541,there are no developments . the thread updates them as we get anything credible
5542,150k troops is 70 % of russia military ?
5543,portugal just invaded spain . portuguese flag flying over madrid right now .
5544,apparently my joke from last night was original but it's classipied .
5545,no they went with taco bell tonight
5546,bruh my brain turned off at for 
5547,good thing i've got an old hardrive from years ago with plenty of 30 second christinamodel and wifeysworld . movs
5548,"> imagine a full scale hacker war what , you think the hackers are holding back ..!? were surrounded by bots .. being hacked is all daycevery dsy"
5549,reddit upvotes .
5550,just tabloids . if you search russia ukraine invasion 3am its all from the sun and other sites of the sort .
5551,"someone points a gun at me and says they aren't going to shoot me , i don't care if they are lying , they need to put the gun down ."
5552,"until they remove a significant portion of their military from the border of ukraine , i would be hesitant to take them at their word . if it were * just * russia , maybe i'd be more inclined to believe them ? but it's russia , belarus and the black sea . this doesn't scream peace to me no matter what they're saying ."
5553,yes . they lie all the time .
5554,"that's the problem with a war , you don't need the other party's consent to start one ."
5555,you should have done that long time ago
5556,"nah , today at 10 am but with smaller scale"
5557,"i know a great russian guy ( around 30 ), like the sweetest kind of person , who unironically loves stalin and thinks everything wrong that he did was just means to an end . the scale of brainwashing is unbelievable ."
5558,"i'm here , yes"
5559,"czech here , rooting for you guys !"
5560,someone on the kiev livestream in the bottom left hand corner was flashing a light in a sequence of morse code flashes .
5561,because people in this thread are crazy .
5562,when why waste their cyber attack ?
5563,"idk how people can joke about this , imagine just throwing away a sentence that the war has started . its lives at stakes"
5564,some people just love spreading misinformation ...
5565,"people are just posting bullshit . ignore any comment here , if it happens itll be front page news ."
5566,both downvoted for being sourceless garbage
5567,its not like they can criticize him
5568,"hey man , you got some grass ?"
5569,they should put him on the currency when this is all over .
5570,""" this comment by fishfucker is very noteworthy """
5571,"do you think anne frank ever thought that 70 years later , her diary would be read in almost every country in the world ?"
5572,"definitely . he has a closet full of skeletons , he is a lifelong grifter and parasite ."
5573,he might as well move there if he loves it so much .
5574,i remember the feeds from multiple iraq invasions and you could plainly see the missiles and bombs hitting baghdad in rapid succession for days . of course those were cnn cameras and not youtube livestreams .
5575,"what do you imagine a training exercise looks like , general ?"
5576,nobody who serious believes that . still fun to track what you can and speculate without claiming to be an expert . hell . its probably purposely allowed fir disinformation purposes .
5577,yes i am putin
5578,"vlad reading this thread like * write that down , write that down! *"
5579,"ukraine : "" invade if gay """
5580,"but what if they say "" no homo "" every time they fire off a tank round ?"
5581,"it's like fema , so the presumption is they expect a disaster around crimea ( bombs , refugees ), want to be prepared , or want to psyche people out by making us presume that russia is expecting a disaster situation to unfold . that's just my logical deduction . i could be wrong i just heard about this all.half an hour ago ."
5582,"given how targeted the leaks have been , its clear that russian c2 was compromised to an impressive degree . i just was waiting for biden to say on tv , "" and to putin , i say , that sandwich you're eating could use more mayo ."" and just walk away ."
5583,"i hope too . it is still quiet outside , i'm lying in bed now and have my windows opened ."
5584,amen . can't even imagine the stress for the poor locals .
5585,"i appreciate your words ! my mother had panic attack in the morning yesterday ( it is wednesday already in ukraine ). was packing an emergency bag with important documents etc . i didn't packed my stuff since i even don't have any place to go in case of real battle actions here , but all this panic makes me a bit depressed . also , to note , i live exactly in center of odessa , like 5 minutes from city hall ."
5586,"exactly as our intelligence said they would . it's a little unsettling how unperturbed putin is that every single move he's making was already known ahead of time and he's not changing any tactics . i think biden definitely made the right call by being very transparent with all our intel on this . there's so little confusion or uncertainty , the narrative has been crystal clear from the start . it's nice having everyone on the same page for once when it comes to mr kgb and his never ending obfuscation . and frankly , while trying to whittle geopolitics down to matters of heroes and villains is at best childish and at worst grossly irresponsible and uninformed , it is kind of interesting to see putin take on this openly villainous role , not caring how the world sees him anymore . just straight-up invading , unprovoked , with no workable justification in place , with the eyes of the world on him , and the entire western world telling him don't fucking do it . he's painting a picture of himself that is very useful for rallying people and allies against , and it makes nato look fantastic . as with so many domestic disputes in many countries as of late , feels like the masks are coming off and the aporant are not bothering to even pretend anymore ."
5587,yeah they didnt know what they were in for . i heard onlookers were throwing up .
5588,"wait really ?! thats fascinating , any idea where i can read more about this ?"
5589,"it's so heartbreaking . i've been on the same thought train as you on all this . i'm so appreciative of being able to follow this situation minute by minute , but the reality behind it all is awful to think about ."
5590,"some may be closer to the situation and are making jokes as a coping mechanism , you just dont know . ive got a dark sense of humor , and i can only imagine thats exactly what id be doing right now ."
5591,"its because people see plane over ukraine ( not many lately , most airlines seem to take another route ) and they click on plane trying to find forte11 or 12"
5592,"room temp iq russians that been watching state-sponsored news for the past 20years , just my guess though lol"
5593,it's also in english . let that tell you who
5594,there are a lot of people who eat it up . merely having something contrarian in your back pocket to say when confronted matters far more than it being true .
5595,"silly ivan , left his tank in krasnoyarsk again "
5596,"it's very serious , sharon !! yes , they're playing space jam and it's reuters but its incredibly serious"
5597,i hope this blows over as a big nothing burger . stay strong . we're thinking of you and your people
5598,"user name does not check out , mate"
5599,mongolia should seize this opportunity
5600,it's finally time for mongolia to put their master plan in motion . the russians never saw it coming .
5601,"it's a bit like we're sitting and waiting for 9/11 to happen instead of seeing it on the news . eerie is the right word , very eerie . goddam i hope nothing happens"
5602,the insurance companies pulled coverage off flights over ukraine .
5603,they are ok . war is here from 2014 btw .
5604,"you get 3 cyberattacks per half , so they are still fine . it's not like matt nagy is the head of russia , nothing to worry about ."
5605,and that's putting it nicely lol
5606,"im so sorry you , your country and family have to go through this . i cant imagine what that feeling is like . i hope nothing happens and everyone stays safe . the world might seem crazy these days but there are hundreds of millions of people who still care about humanity and everyone that lives on the planet . dont lose hope ."
5607,"best wishes , i hope you and your family are able to stay safe ."
5608,"the irony is i don't feel really anxious or whatever right now . it was very stressful in 2014 , especially in odessa [ clashes ]( ( i was there personally near trade unions house and my classmates were in the middle of clash in deribasovskaya street ). it was stressful when the news about war was new to us . after 8 years of living with this i just feel exhausted . this evening i was having a walk for about two hours ( i play ingress and also need to breath the cold fresh air after covid-related oxygen therapy ), the local telegram news channels were posting shit about people being panicking , withdrawing all their savings from atm and sweeping emergency first needed stuff off the shops . well , no , it wasn't . people are casually walking around in centre of odessa , no cries , deliverymen were doing their usual delivery things , musicians playing for few spectators on the streets . also , i have read news that army flooded the city and police checks documents to prevent russian terrorist attacks . i didn't see anybody at all . two patrol police cars , one of which was staying in parking near mcdonald's , nobody checks documents or pays special attention to the situation ."

6090,nato is just selling weapons to a peaceful neighbor who is absolutely not engaged in a war according to the russians . don't see what the problem is
6091,"many countries will continue to send weapons and supplies , because we know if we don't , when you finish with ukraine , you will move onto other neighboring countries . you have all that land in your own country , and doing nothing with it . why you feel the need to attack neighbors is foolish . so we will keep helping ukraine , and force you to use up as much military ordinance as possible , till you give up . and i hope that all the wealth our banks have frozen , will be handed over to ukraine to rebuild by order of the un and it's judicial court ."

6107,"how about no..they are protecting themselves , thing is russia thought they could bully a smaller less powerful country to take it over for the gain of there power !!! ukraine was fully prepared before the war anyways ! if nato was to be drafted into a war i'd give russia at least 6months to be crushed and there country ! so stop giving it the big one lavrov be fking careful where you turn"
6108,russia put bounty on us soldiers heads in afghanistan and supplied weapons to the talibans
6109,russia : we're engaged in the war with nato nato : supplies weapons to those endangered by russia russia : * surprised pikachu face *
6110,"so basically , russia called it a special military operation to put on a facade that their military was still mighty and that they would not have to engage in a full war to take ukraine . as it turns out , ukraine has enough bodies and the west has enough weapons/cash to bolster them against the russian army . as it turns out , the russian army is actually a big pile of shit . in order to save face to their own people , russia is now say that it is a war against natotheyre obviously not at war with nato , but id a narrative to help them save face when it comes to why theyre making little to no progress . in reality , if russia and nato were actually at war , russia wouldve been defeated quite quickly . putin and russia are now left with no allies other than former soviet countries ( even they are starting to turn on russia ) and china . in the end , i think russia is going to basically become a satellite state for china ."
6111,"once ukraine survived the first couple of weeks , a few western countries saw the potential of this invasion . now , for sure , it's a full-blown proxy war , and russia is going to bleed-out . not only that , it's become a wake-up call to all those defence sluggards , like germany , to rapidly start rebuilding their militaries . not only that , but it's shown those fence-sitters , like finland and sweden , where safety really lies . all good for nato . not only that , it's a chance for the west to see who is really on our side , and who is supporting the dark side - people like india and hungary . and where china sits . not only that , putin has shown his hand and gone all in on tyranny . now no one can pretend they don't see what he really is - except of course those people that are the same kind , and now we can see who they are too . the sanctions will slowly have an effect on russia's economy , and eventually break them financially . a weak military and a weak economy will push russia back to the 1990s . it's bad news for ukraine in the short-term , but the longer this ' war ' goes on , the weaker russia will become and the less of a future threat putin and his cronies will be ."
6112,is this the same country that put bounties on coalition troops in afghanistan ? now whining that the world is helping the victim of their unprovoked war of aggression ? so terribly pathetic .
6113,go fuck yourself russia
6114,russia declared war on the united states when he interfered with our elections and when he attacked our infrastructure by shutting down the colonial pipeline .
6115,send more weapons to ukraine . got it .
6116,russia better hope they don't go to war with nato . they can't even handle holding territory in ukraine or operating in the black sea against a country that has no navy .
6117,then stop fucking invading ukraine
6118,essentially it seems like this will boil to russia's ultimatums : * give us ukraine or nuke * give us moldova or nuke * don't help by sending arms or nuke * give us or nuke putin is an utter piece of shit .
6119,"russia : "" alright , nato , you want a war ? you got a war !"" nato : "" k . let's war ."" russia : "" whoa , whoa ! we didn't say _war_ , we said...um ... _vore_ . yeah , we'd like to show you our fetish art ! want to...donate to our patreon ?"" nato : "" oh , gee , russia , we would , but we've already sorted our budget for the year ; you know , we're making a looooooooot of anti-tank missiles . don't let anyone kink-shame you , though ."""
6120,if they escalate to nukes they know it will be the end of russia as a sovereign country . what is wrong with them ?!
6121,"dear russia , do fuck off . sincerely , pretty much everyone"
6122,"no , russia . if you were at war with nato , you would have lost already ."
6123,this is what makes me think that russia won't throw the n word if nato responded to this invasion . russia would lose significantly in that scenario and putin knows it
6124,"dear russia , if you were at war with nato you'd fucking know it by the devastation of your military and cities given how shitty your military performance has been against just ukraine armed with your own weapons and some nato manpads/atgms ."
6125,"it's crazy to think how close putin's plan came to working . if trump would have remained in office , the us would have withdrawn from nato by now and would be supporting russia . instead , this has backfired spectacularly ."
6126,"theyll casually claim to be at war with nato , while literally taking no direct action against them , but completely deny their invasion of ukraine for months while fumbling through their notes of why its not a war , as well so why are they there and what their goals even are ."
6127,not just the west is supplying weapons and aid
6128,well the west will stop supplying weapons to ukraine when russia also stops supplying weapons to ukraine . along with soldiers and tanks and fucking kadyrov einsatzgruppen .
6129,bitch nato hasn't even started firing yet .
6130,"russia : bro stop we are losing stop sending weapons to those freaks meanwhile ukraine : farmers , charge"
6131,"i mean...the us/nato has been involved in proxy wars for three quarters of a century with russia . i don't think calling it a proxy war really changes anything . i'm sure the us and nato have geopolitical interests in ukraine , but that doesn't change the fact that russia is the barbaric aggressor and supporting ukraine is the morally justified position ."
6132,"careful with the rhetoric , moscow . calling it a war on nato * could * provide legal standing to trigger article v . i'm not saying it will , and i'm not even saying it is likely . the four military powerhouses of nato ( germany , uk , france , us ) are hesitant to commit troops , so that's unlikely , but an article v trigger would provide legal means to escalate in response to any crazy russian actions ."
6133,"a proxy war between the west and russia ? ohhh nooo , not the same thing that has been happening across the world since the end of ww2 . how could the west do that ?! s /"
6134,mummy they won't let me take the country i wanna take the country mummy tell them to stop it mummy .
6135,"lavrov says "" war means war "". it is a crime in russia to suggest that russia is involved in a war in ukraine - according to putin the war is just a ' special operation '!"
6136,the us and nato providing defensive weapons to the ukraine government is hardly an act of war especially in comparison to russia's invasion of ukraine that includes the rape and murder of it's civilians .
6137,"stop "" pouring oil on the fire "" * says the people who set the fucking fire in the first place !*"
6138,there is no war . so how can supplying ukraine with weapons be a threat to russia ?
6139,"why would nato stop supplying weapons if russia says they're "" engaged in a war "" with them . if someone told me they where in a war with me i'd bloody start buying and supplying weapons"
6140,"sure would be a crying shame if we accidentally overarmed ukraine and they took back crimea . would be a big oopsie , oh well ."
6141,pretty sure an actual war with nato would mean the decapitation of the russian leadership . putin doesn't want that .
6142,"hey , we are at war with you . stop fighting back !"
6143,russia will know they are engaged in a war with nato when they look outside and their military infrastructure is smoldering holes in the ground .
6144,"the west will stop supplying weapons to ukraine as soon as russia stops supplying weapons to ukraine . sounds like a fair deal , no ?"
6145,"oh russia , if you were engaged in war with nato , you wouldnt be able to bitch about it ."
6146,"stop crying and go home , you lost mate ! like what u expect we just sit here and let you massacre our neighbors ??? fuck you putin !"
6147,"that would make russia an official enemy , and treason charges can be levied against their assets like tucker carlson and rand paul ."
6148,"nato is simply engaged in a "" special military operation "" in ukraine . who said anything about a war ?"
6149,"actually , i think russia has supplied more tanks , trucks , apc's and other heavy equipment to ukraine's military than anybody ."
6150,"it is very unpleasant for russia to lose to ukraine . but they fed their people for 10 years with propaganda that ukraine has a weak army and it will not be difficult to defeat it . now their media is increasingly mentioning that the western world supplies weapons and mercenaries , so they are already at war not with ukraine , but with nato . losing nato is more honorable than ukraine ."
6151,this whole thing kinda stops if you just leave ukraine .
6152,"supplying ? nah , it's just special operation"
6153,they only hate nato because it prevents russia from expanding into the directions they're planning to .
6154,this isnt war . its a special supply operation .
6155,were at war with you nato . stop supplying yourselves with weapons so we can win . vladimir putin
6156,clickbait title . they said they were engaged in a proxy war with nato
6157,"the next "" ground war "" that the us fights will primarily use uavs . and , the thing is , we don't even really care if they get shot down . we have factories that can crank them out at an industrial pace . russia wouldn't stand a chance against that . everything from the big predators armed with hellfires , all the way down to little ones armed with that new sig rifle . imagine 40 or 50 of those little bastards armed with 100 round drum magazines of that new 6.8mm round and flir cameras that can zoom in to take clean point shots from a quarter mile away guarded by unmanned helicopters armed with the same 40mm cannon the apache uses , with a solar powered predator drone circling overhead . all of it controlled by a team of nerds deep under cheyenne mountain . with a couple platoons of commandos on the ground to get whatever the drones missed . that's the next ground war for the us ."
6158,"reading the article , i see another fool asking the russians for a "" humanitarian truce "" and a "" humanitarian corridor ."" to the russians , that just means the ukrainian civilians all come out of hiding and line up straight down the roads to be more easily shot at . oh , sorry . the fool i meant is the un secretary-general , antonio guterres . no surprise there ."
6159,"tell you what russia,you stop attacking and killing innocent ukrainians and retreat then we will stop supplying weapons,easy really"
6160,u/media_honesty
6161,its irrelevant what russia says . theres no point trying to navigate around what they say . they make up their own fiction as they go along any way .
6162,"the size of the bear seems to shrink every day , but the roar gets louder ."
6163,""" stop provoking me "" says man , while standing in his neighbor's living room , punching him in the face repeatedly ."
6164,"if they engaged nato , the war would most likely be already over ."
6165,"russia says it wants to reduce the ' considerable ' risk of nuclear war. yeah , so , um , pull out of ukraine ... that'll get the job done asshole ."
6166,"chukcha asking russian soldier : - "" what are you doing ?"" - "" we are fighting against nato in ukraine "" - "" and how it goes ? "" - "" we lost 20000 soldiers and a huge amount of military tech "" - "" and how things are going on nato side ?"" - "" nato did not arrived yet ."""
6167,i think polands and finns armies cant wait to kill as many russian as they can .
6168,"stop interfering in other countries elections and spreading misinformation ! oh , and get out of ukraine ! then maybe the world will stay out of your business . you know , when you stay out of ours ."
6169,bombing a country and their hospitals . - not a war . completely unrelated country trading/donating weapons to another . - is a war . somebody get putin a dictionary .
6170,"or ... follow me on this ... we send more weapons to ukraine . russia goes home with its tail between its legs . ukraine gets all its territory including crimea . ukraine joins nato along with moldova , finland and sweden . russia pays war reparations ."
6171,"whatever the hell russia is calling it now , this has to be hands down one of the stupidest reasons to invade a country . thanks putin for giving us people a reason to unite against imbeciles like yourself and your cronies . this is 2022 and this ussr dream will absolutely not stand ."
6172,"* hey nato you better stop giving weapons to ukraine , or ..* "" or...what ?"" * umm...i...uh...what are you looking at moldova you want to fight me ?*"
6173,russia's in denial of the west ; putin can't fix russia's problems so he's pretending the west is it's problem . ... seems like the west is putin's problem ; too many ways to fix russia without him !
6174,why would nato do that if we're at war ?
6175,"oh so it * is * a war against nato . welp , you dun fucked up mr . putin-head , because now on top of ukraine you have 30 other member nations to contend with ."
6176,"lol russia still thinks its a world power . if nato were to actually enter the field , russia would tuck tale and make vlogs about not being afraid of ending the world ."
6177,every american aircraft shot down by a missile during the vietnam war was shot down by a missile supplied by russia . it was against orders to fire on russian ships offloading missiles in harbors . one f105 pilot who did was put up for court marshal . that that never took place because he was shot down and killed before the proceedings could start by a russian missile .
6178,"then declare war on nato , please !!!!!! we'd go on and wipe russia off the map in about 20 minutes . they can't even beat ukraine ? russia is the biggest military joke in history"
6179,"putin wanted a return to the soviet union days , and what we've got is a good ol ' fashioned proxy war ."
6180,"no , russia provoked a war and are now engaged in that unprovoked war with ukraine who did nothing to crazy vlad or the russian people . nato and some countries that are not even part of nato are providing weapons to ukraine to even the playing field so ukraine can fight on a more or less even playing field . when lunatics get control of countries like putin has in russia , they seem to get power hungry and try to take over other countries . the easy way out for russia is to remove putin from power , pull out of ukraine , pay to rebuild the ukraine and pay the ukrainian families that have lost family members to russia's aggression . and finally restore a democratic form of government in russia ."
6181,"yeah , bitch . you started it . super easy to solve .... go fuck yourself back home !!"
6182,dont push us putin or america is going to show you why the fuck we dont have universal healthcare .
6183,imagine the shock they'll get when nato actually steps in .
6184,the russian people would know if they were at war with nato because they would be eating bombs .
6185,or what?attack ukraine ?
6186,"oh russia , nato's defence budget is 86 % of your total gdp . that's at peacetime spending levels , this is a long way from "" war "" with nato ."
6187,"russian culture is dog shit . no one even has the ability for common reasoning there , they just do whatever the fuck they are told . fucking idiots , all of them ."
6188,> war with nato \* tsk tsk \* special . military . operation .
6189,"how about you go back to your own fucking country , dirtbag ."
6190,"it's kind of a war you can opt out of , russia . by just pulling out of ukraine and leaving them alone ?"
6191,this must be putins version of a white males suicide by cop 
6192,"of that's the case , then send in our troops and jets . call russia out on their bullshit"
6193,"the way russia is acting , it's trump , the country ."
6194,it was originally a special military operation but after russia failed to take ukraine quickly they shit their pants and merged in a new narrative . now they call it war and even throw in some confessed genocide material for good measure . ( this is on russian state tv )
6195,the new law says anyone who calls it a war faces 15 years in prison . i will go ahead and wait for putin to turn himself in . honor system and all . a lot of honor coming out of russia right now ....
6196,he said ' war '. that's a fine !
6197,"no , no , no . it * was * a "" special mission operation "". but * now * it's a war after ukraine aggressively and wrongly interfered with their operation by committing acts of war such as shooting at them and capturing their soldiers and stealing their tanks . / s"
6198,the war is only with the us with the ukrainians is just a special military operation of exterminating them . then russia will say they found cities in rubble so they are just taking over uninhabited land .
6199,"russia just wanted an itsy bitsy little annexation of the entire country , and ukraine had to go ruin it by putting up a fight , and then the meanie west had to go and give them some good weapons and won't even let them keep an eastern chunk ... so mean ."
6200,i would take this as a positive sign . that russia has claimed to be at war with nato is indicative of a desperate realisation of their failings in ukraine . a ramping up of the rhetoric driven by fear .
6201,"it's not weapons delivery , it's digorno ."
6202,perhaps russia could stop hitting itself ?
6203,"there is a very good russian expression that goes likes this , adjusted to the context : "" russia has seven fridays in a week "". basically , russia keeps on lying on every single turn of events , they change their motives and goals and means - everything ! putin has painted himself in the corner so badly , he has discredited himself as a leader on every possible level ."
6204,theres nothing special about it any longer . its just one big cluster fuck russia having a hard time to end .
6205,russian logic gets stranger by the day ...
6206,"we just need a quarter of a million soldiers for this quick little special operation - putin , probably"
6207,"hohoho no , they said "" steamed war "". it's a moscow expression ."
6208,fighting back is an act of war !
6209,we are denazifying you ! stop resisting !!!
6210,"russia : stop fighting back , or else !"
6211,they can stop special operating too .
6212,"typical bully . wants everything their own way . stop helping the people that we are attacking for no good reason , we are the victim of you help them . wait .. we are the victim , thats why we did special operations in ukraine "
6213,"seriously why isn't this the only response given . "" ya we could stop giving them weapons or you could you know ... fuck off back to russia !"""
6214,invading and forcefully deporting ukrainians to siberia
6215,""" stop hitting yourself !"""
6216,62 days into a 3 day operation
6217,nato : how ' bout now ? i'm free right now .
6218,reminds me of some historical battle i heard about where one side lost several ~~ thousand ~~ hundred soldiers . the other side arrived late and never took part in the battle .
6219,> nato : was not even aware it was engaged in a war .
6220,seems like a pretty effective organization this nato . who wouldnt want to be a part of that ??
6221,> russia's ~~ war ~~ ** special operation !!!** against nato .
6222,because i don't think we need a crazy man with nuclear launch codes to get too nervous of losing the war .
6223,"they are going to be shocked if nato does start fighting haha if the ukranians are obliterating them this hard , wait until 3.5 million soldiers tanks planes and robots start pushing . ukraine is going to special operation the entire of russia ."
6224,russia hurt itself in confusion
6225,""" and if you don't let me win i will kill my self with nuclear weapons !"" - lavrov"
6226,"i always thought russia was the 2nd best military in the world , behind usa . now its the second best military in ukraine ."
6227,"reminds me of that quote : the nazis entered this war under the rather childish delusion that they were going to bomb everyone else , and nobody was going to bomb them . at rotterdam , london , warsaw , and half a hundred other places , they put their rather naive theory into operation . they sowed the wind , and now they are going to reap the whirlwind. "
6228,"ugh , don't you get how inconvenient it is for them not to be able to rape and kill civilians without us trying to stop it ?"
6229,its like they start punching a kid and then get mad that someone walking past helps the kid fight back . that kid is an orphan you cant protect him! 
6230,i teach 4 year olds that handle losing better than russia .
6231,have you seen russian tv ? theyre complete barbarians advocating for killing women and children . theyre calling them subhuman scum . its crazy how many russians citizens follow them blindly
6232,did they just declare war on nato ?
6233,"> nato , in essence , is engaged in a war with russia through a proxy following their logic they're at war with the us already seeing how they payed bounties to taliban terrorists for killing american soldiers"
6234,"putin doesn't see ukraine as a "" country "", but as a territory . he's not "" invading a country "", he's performing a defensive "" special operation "" on a "" historically russian territory "", populated with "" essenstially the same people "", in order to restore russia's security and to punch back the "" western controlled forces "" ( because ukraine virtually cannot have a genuine agency of their own , if it's not attached to russia somehow ) from the border as far as possible . invasion = essentially , is seen as an act of justice , self-defense and an inevitable righteous punishment against a lousy little brother , punishment he "" was asking for for a long time "", thing that "" must be solved inside the ( abusive ) family "". nato giving arms is like a stranger bringing weapons to that brother so they could harm you when you try to punish him for disobedience and being not conservative enough ."
6235,everything russia says is a lie
6236,bang on the money . their state tv also suggested it last week as an excuse for why the ' special military operation ' wasn't going to plan .
6237,"if thats what it takes , fine put . now get the f out of ukraine already ."
6238,"it is clear that russia wants to get out of the war before we are given a serious amount of heavy offensive weapons - saving face and taking over several regions . this is evidenced by 1 ) the conduct of negotiations , 2 ) the rush to establish occupation administrations , the introduction of the ruble , the ban on the ukrainian language in schools ."
6239,bingo
6240,they're already loosing and nato haven't even arrived yet .
6241,war with nato means moscow looks like baghdad in ' 03
6242,seriously . ukraine dank their flagship and don't even have a navy . can you imagine what the us navy would do to them ?
6243,russia : we are engaged in war with nato nato : oh . we did not notice that? 
6244,""" bitch we haven't started yet """
6245,"its literally winter war 2 electric boogaloo . im not even joking the motivations are the same , the results are ( predictably ) the same , the russian failures are the same . putin and his cronies seem to have a combined iq that might be room temperature if were being generous ."
6246,""" saint javelin , the orders came ; strke the foe , bless my aim !"" book of armaments , chaper 9 , verse 11"
6247,"putin knew he was dying and wanted to do some good , so he became a supervillain in order to unite more countries ( finland and sweden joining nato , ukraine in a decade or so ) and weaken russia , which has * never * had good leadership or government in its entire history , and to eventually make russia an occupied country forced to democratize . the west is suddenly much bigger . this even forces the west to speed up green technologies to get away from oil , giving less funding to shitty nations and saving the planet . this conspiracy theory is less stupid than putin is in reality ."
6248,this is like russias fifth vietnam if you want be loose with the american allegory there
6249,> this is russia's vietnam . pretty sure the winter war was russia's vietnam...or come to think of it afghanistan...or chechnya . russia's had a lot of vietnam's really .
6250,"i wonder if there's going to be a wave of serial killers in russia too , just like after the us lost the war on vietnam ."
6251,"i think thats a bit optimistic . i fear they will be going the way of north korea in the long run . total state control of info , zero tolerance of any perceived dissent , majority brainwashed population ."
6252,"exactly , i kinda don't believe that most of their nukes are in a usable state.the plutonium needs to be replaced every 10 years to retain effectivity , and if russia's corruption is anything to go by , this doesn't happen , there were also reports that this doesn't happen . some of the nukes may still be viable , but hopefully they won't be able to launch them properly . since they might prepare 10-100 nukes in a firable range out of the thousands they have . imagine the high ranking officers thinking : "" well , if they launch the nukes , i'm probably dead anyways , and they won't notice that the are unusable until launched"".this is not weapons that are meant to be used , but to flex the power , we've seen the state of weapons that are meant to be used , now imagine state of the weapons that are not meant to be used ."
6253,it would probably be a good thing for russia in the long haul . it could he rebuilt with a marshall like plan without the corruption .
6254,the only problem is that russia isn't winning and having a hissy-fit about it ....
6255,"russia was sucked dry by putin and oligarchs , with their population decreasing and their technology and armament getting more decrepit and useless as the time goes . so the only solution seen by putin was to find new countries to loot before its too late , in the good tsarist and soviet tradition - and this is how ukraine became the target ..."
6256,every destroyed russian tank or airplane is one less they can use when they attack the baltics
6257,"they are so embarassed that the ukrainian military is crushing the russian military . it sounds better to say that they are fighting nato and that's why they are losing and not making progress . if they admit that the ukrainians are successfully defending their country , then the russian people will understand that the russian military is complete shit . this will also open up a window to let the russian government admit they are using a big portion of the russian military , now since they are fighting nato . it will enable them to use military reserves and draft civilians . and it will enable them to finally calling this a real war , instead of pretending it is not . the propaganda lies are harder and harder to keep up with , so this will be a welcome release to let some air out of the balloon before it pops and the curtains fall . it will also enable them to use nuclear weapons without hiding it from the russian people ."
6258,"right . that is what im goin to say too . if russia is at war with nato , there will be no more russian armed forces ."
6259,nato literally has enough resources to recreate the block out the sun scene from 300 with drones
6260,> and has warned that western weapons are inflaming the conflict in ukraine . that's kind of the point .
6261,the russians are the 1 exporter of weapons to the ukrainian military lol
6262,"no , it's the same shit they said two months ago"
6263,our weapons are on holiday .
6264,a special supply operation
6265,> if nato was to be drafted into a war i'd give russia at least 6months you really underestimate how much of a crushing advantage nato has over russia .
6266,"say ' not only that ' one more time , and you'll spawn a drinking game ."
6267,slava ukraina !
6268,sell . we're selling them to ukraine . what they do after is their own business .
6269,"i really wish a state leader would ask him this point blank , if they were even able to meet . he can't tell biden , or even a nato state leader , that "" yes , our nations are at war "" because then there's no choice but to act like we're at full scale war . and putin might be the only russian realizing that 99.99 % of nato is just sitting on their hands at the moment ."
6270,"nato isn't going to respond . it's completely counter to what they are trying to achieve . russia is bleeding fast . putin is desperate , no one else is . even ukraine is resolute and will be to the last person , just like you see in mariupol . he wants his weakness and paranoia to spread like an infection . if he uses nukes , it will be because he's given the opportunity to do so , it's impactful for his personal goals and it's his best option . that's the kind of guy he is . the only way i could see that playing out is if he gets stuffed on this push to conquer moldova . if ukraine can kill enough of his forces , his threats will become more specific . once they are much less vague than this you may want to buy a cigar or something just in case , but i wouldn't let it stop you from living your life . people survived the cold war , we can survive this by just not giving in to the despair , discord and paranoia ."
6271,it's just crazy putin went ahead and committed to it anyway
6272,this is violet from wonka ?
6273,"nono , they're at war with nato and special operating against ukraine . totally different things !"
6274,we have always been in a special military operation against eastasia .
6275,but people can still be jailed for calling it a war ? or is that old news now ?
6276,special trouser fecal operation . going exactly as planned .
6277,"could you imagine the panic youd feel inside when you invade a country thinking youll take it in a few days and it goes completely sideways ? your biggest rival with incredibly deep pockets and a burning desire to see you take a huge l starts sending weapons better than your own to the country youre trying to invade . people think those are bullet proof vests putin wears under his clothes . those are all the layers of undershirts he has to wear so people cant see him sweating . he looks calm and collected , but on the inside that asshole has to be in full on panic mode ."
6278,"putin can go fuck off , piece of shit ego ."
6279,15 years in prison i thought .
6280,that's a paddlin '
6281,don't mention the war ! lavrov mentioned it once and he thinks he got away with it !
6282,"' is not war , silly , is only special operation of eradication of ukrainians '"
6283,how to spend special budget ? if not spend will more cut next year 
6284,speds need surgery too tho
6285,everything they do is special 
6286,"a bully will always do mental gymnastics to tell themselves they are a victim . for similar reasons , you should always be very sceptical of anyone trying to tell you that you are a victim because the odds are that they are trying to enable and cultivate your worst self for their own ends . putin , for instance , has convinced russians that the ukranians are puppets of the west , being used to bully them . therefore , the russians are justified in everything that they do as they can describe it as self defence ."
6287,yes a swift kick in the happy sacks is what's needed for bullies
6288,stop hitting myself!! 
6289,its like watching magikarp flail while its eaten alive by a snorlax .
6290,""" a three hour tour....three hour tour ..."""
6291,gritty reboot of gilligan's island .
6292,""" come on , morty , in-and-out , a 3-day mission ."""
6293,62 days into a 4 hour operation
6294,i'd fly with nato burton .
6295,"1788 , battle of karnsebes ."
6296,there's also this
6297,we cant let fear of that prevent of from acting
6298,"not even the soldiers . just imagine the b-2s , f-22s , and f-35s . there are already over 750 f-35s in service worldwide , far outnumbering the amount of 5th gen that they even claim to have ."
6299,"war is hard , you guuuuyyyysss ."
6300,i'm hoping for more of a hitler 1945 post invasion of berlin for putin . over under on if it's arsenic or cyanide ?
6301,"all jokes aside , it has to be china at 2 ( newer tech , better at logistics , more money , slightly more anti-corruption focus ) and basically every significant european power ahead of russia . the logistics"
6302,do you have a link or something to share ? kinda baffled how ukraine can be in their eyes both sub-human and the supposed origin of all their culture ?
6303,"this is why it was so difficult to get westerners to recognise the threat russia poses . alex jones looks like a babe toying with a dimly understood gift in comparison to solovyev and the other glenn becks on russian tv . the programming is totally disgusting and proudly so . it revels in cruelty , spite and revanchism ."
6304,"> its crazy how many russians citizens follow them blindly when the russian economy crashes at the end of the second quarter , starvation and hunger will be the only sense that russian civilians will be paying any attention towards ."
6305,"this is going to end with the duma on fire . whether it'll be started by russians or nato remains to be seen , but burn it shall ."
6306,the less you educate your population the easier it is to brain wash them . so watch out for politicians that cut education they may be planning domthing evil .
6307,kinda like how crazy it is that so many americans blindly follow trump a lot of dumb people in this world . propoganda is a powerful tool
6308,have you seen fox news or other right wing outlets . they are calling immigrates sub human scum . rapists and thugs . its crazy how americans follow them blindly .
6309,"russia lost 20000 soldiers , hundreds of tanks and artillery , hundreds of aircraft , top secret electronic weapons , and the fleet flagship at war with nato . and nato hasnt even shown up to the war yet ."
6310,"thats the winning ticket .. we arent at war with ukraine , only nato "
6311,""" dear nato , please destroy the rest of our army . luv , from russia ."""
6312,"it is true though , it is a proxy war by now , a proxy war by nato , a full scale invasion war by russia . of course they apparently won't admit the latter ."
6313,"of course they are . russia and us have been fighting proxy wars for decades . it's not a surprising statement at all and it's not a "" gotcha "" conclusion ."
6314,"> putin doesn't see ukraine as a "" country "" no one should care about what putin says that he sees or does not see . he's a lawyer , he ** knows ** ukraine ** is ** a country . it is a member of the un and a country that russia has formally recognized and formally promised never to attack in an agreeement filed with the un , signed by putin ."
6315,"that might be the image he wants to project , but i highly doubt he believes it ."
6316,i think you have it correctly .
6317,i mean it is one of the reason for sure .
6318,' the ban on ukrainian language in schools ' that's exactly what the english did to the scots regarding gaelic . it's an effective strategy . i can't speak it . can't believe we're still using it in 2022 though .
6319,losing
6320,"i kinda hope that nato has been secretly pushing whole battalions of troops into ukraine under cover , just waiting for putin to fuck up and say "" yep , we're declaring war on nato "", so they can pop up like little surprise soldiers and just wipe the floor with the russians ."
6321,"russia : "" you took everything from me !"" nato : "" i don't know who you are . """
6322,"an interesting outcome of musk buying twitter for 44 billion dollars , is that dividing that into russia's estimated 2021 economic value of 3038 billion , we can determine that russia has the equivalent of about 69 twitters ."
6323,"to be fair , finland lost a fair share of territory in the winter war . i'm hoping ukraine won't have to , but judging by the amount of contradictory bullshit kremlin's pr department is constantly pouring out , i'm thinking putin is looking for any kind of "" victory "" in negotiations ( ukraine ceding krim , for instance ), after which they can claim to the russians that this was the objective all along ."
6324,"finland eventually lost quite a bit of territory , including what once was a major finnish city ( viborg ). however , finland did not have that much help in the first and third phases of the wars . in the middle , they had a lot of help from germany , but as germany lost , that help vanished and they sued for peace . ukraine is receiving a lot more help now than finland did ."
6325,putin has a tumor-covered brain from his cancer . if russian oligarchs had two brain cells to rub together for heat they'd act but if it isn't the status quo they won't hear it .
6326,the gospel of texas instruments .
6327,thats what happens when you are a belligerent asshole .
6328,"they won the winter war . but regardless , do you not count the fall of the soviet union as a cataclysmic cultural shift ?"
6329,is there some literature you can recommend about the correlation between the loss in vietnam and an increase in serial killers ? that sounds fascinating .
6330,"as i understand it , its not the fissile material which is the main consideration , but the fusion material . i have read that soviet designs ( bear in mind that there have been no tests since then ) require a more frequent replacement than western designs , and that a one year cycle is about right ."
6331,"yeah , but it's a big stretch to assume all of their nukes are non functional . even if only 10 % successfully launched , that would be more that enough to wreck the world since there would undoubtedly be retaliatory nukes sent back in response ."
6332,"even if they haven't replaced the plutonium in their nukes , that still makes them ( low yield ) dirty bombs . the decay products of plutonium are nasty things in the "" bad "" range of decay times ( e.g ., [ americium-241 ]( and its 432 year half-life )."
6333,"> we've seen the state of weapons that are meant to be used they are using the weapons they have very effectively . have you seen mariupol ? their commanders and soldiers and tactics may be shit , but their bullets , bombs and artillery are working just fine . i think it would be a very big mistake to assume their nukes are trash ."
6334,moabs for everyone !
6335,"you've avoided the bully but the bully attacks you , to everyone's surprise you are getting the better of the bully , escalating the fight is in your interest , you can finish them ."
6336,i'm not sure they would last 6 weeks .
6337,yeah ukraine has about 1%of the power of nato and they struggle hard with them . i bet it would be 1 week of preparing and another week for nato to be in moscow .
6338,the problem with mutually assured destruction is that both sides have to believe the other is crazy enough to actually do it . kinda doesn't seem like that's the case atm .
6339,not only that...i'll drink to the success of ukraine and total failure of putin !
6340,"no , we're not selling weapons ! it's just a "" special business operation "". / s"
6341,"the only way nato responds is if the russian do something unbelievably stupid , like drop a nuke or invade a nato country , otherwise theyre more than content to sit back and give the ukrainians all the firepower theyll need"
6342,he's built himself an echo chamber that convinced him that biden is weak and nato would be divided over the issue .
6343,"so if they are at war with nato , what's stopping nato from moving in and removing russian soldiers from ukraine ?"
6344,"there never has been any war with eurasia , they are our allies ."
6345,"they easily [ can ]( but only if they are opposition , not tv propagandists ."
6346,dictators are always in panic mode . perpetually watching their backs .
6347,"russian president , go fuck yourself ."
6348,oh no ! dont drink anything from now on !
6349,"that's what they call a small fine in russia , if you find out what a hefty fine is you will jump out the window"
6350,i thought it meant cyanide capsule in a bunker in a city under siege... 
6351,"good news , russian tank factories stopped production since they can't source needed electronics . now you can cut "" getting new stuff "" from the budget"
6352,"good news ! special budget can be allocated to staffing newly opened employee positions . in addition , accounting says that equipment captured by farmers can be a complete write-off ."
6353,speds = special education ?
6354,the biggest victims i've known convince themselves they're okay or in control . consummate victims are almost always abusers .
6355,damn right 
6356,a flailing magikarp with nuclear weapons haphazardly strapped onto it
6357,it hurt itself in confusion !
6358,"at this point , i think gilligan could hold off the russians ."
6359,"this reminded me of the "" operation failed successfully "" screenshot meme . in putin's case it will be "" operation succeeded miserably ."""
6360,"if this is gilligans island , wheres ginger and mary ann ?!"
6361,i also like this guy timothy from baltimore
6362,and it started because of an argument over schnapps .
6363,"thats probably the one haha ! okay 500 dead , but still pretty funny !"
6364,theres also the one with the nazis fighting themselves .
6365,they dont even have a legitimate fifth gen fighter as far as im aware
6366,nah . polonium .
6367,"im hoping for more of a gaddafi moment , give him a bayonet up there"
6368,i'd accept a qaddafing at this point .
6369,nowitschok would make for good flavor in this case .
6370,"i want a marcus licinius crassus moment for putin . after defeating crassus roman army outside the town of carrhae , the parthians removed his head and filled his mouth with gold . this was done to mock crassus insatiable greed ."
6371,"i wish there were more reasons for optimism that putin shooting himself in a bunker would set russia on the path that germany took . if the country collapses again , i just assume the next generation of massive kleptos will snatch up everything for themselves and keep the cycle going ."
6372,i was expecting this haha
6373,anti-corruption in china actually means anti-former-leaders-friends-corruption . it's a common mistranslation .
6374,"i don't know about the other western european powers . france , maybe , britain holds up in a coalition with a water channel between them and russia . but western europe has spent the last three decades disarming itself , like much of the west . ukraine is holding up , after 8 years of preparation , training and as much armament as they could sneak under the nose of a nuclear power . the ukrainian army had 135 000 active ground troops at the outbreak of war , and 900 000 reservists . germany's entire armed forces has 183 000 troops , 15 000 reserves . 65000 of that is the army . 27 000 in a logistics support service branch . the french are sitting at 208 000 , with 35 000 reserves . 118 000 of that is the army . britain has 194 000 , 37 000 reserves . 86 000 in the army . those are the three biggest western european powers . germany , france , and britain combine for less than 800 000 total troops . honestly it is wonderful from a philosophical perspective , and if you told a soldier in 1945 those numbers , they'd think it was all worth it . but when russia is ranting about taking on nato once they're through with those damn ukrainians , i think it's time to spin up the rearmament machine . peace has a price ."
6375,"i have my doubt . ( not saying you're wrong , you may be right .) china has a severe lack of ability to project power and i have doubts about the ability for themselves to sustain their military and how well it's trained . i also have doubts about the quality of the equipment or at least the amount that would be needed to sustain a soldier base of that size . i think their military may be a show pony . i lean towards thinking the eu may be the second strongest military force . france actually pulls a lot of weight , toss in germany who's no slouch and then the combined skills , training and technology of the rest . if we're excluding the eu because it's a treaty defense force similar to nato . i lean towards france or india being number 2 . i say this knowing that china outspends and out mans both but france trains and equips their military exceptionally well and works with all nato and eu countries to maximize skills and they're up on the latest strategies and best practices . i think france and india punch well above their weight and they're almost always in the top 10 military forces anyways . i say india because they have a very large force , that is reasonably trained with a lot of special forces that are exceptional and they've had a mindset that they may have to invade or be invaded since pakistan split off . they're trained under the mantra of ' when ' rather than ' if '. it's an intangible but i think it's actually important . 2 months ago i would have said u.s ., russia , china but russia's failures have made me look hard at china and i think they may have some of the same issues but also have a perspective of they never want to get involved in a war so they only need to defend but they don't really need to defend because they have nukes . i could be wrong but i definitely would have been wrong before russia invaded ."
6376,kind of like people who hate jews . jews control everything and are better at everything but also subhuman and worse in everyway . bigotry doesn't need logic .
6377,"oh don't worry . russia is working hard to eliminate any trace in any medium that would suggest ukraine is the birth place of anything , so by that time there's no contradictions left ( in russia anyways ). in fact , i wouldn't be surprised if they simply pretend ukraine never existed anyways . i wish i was even joking , but russia already published they believe that the ukraine identity ( country , culture , language etc ) has no place in reality ..."
6378,they were fucking parading ru soldier mother who's son died in ua and that idiot woman was saying she's proud of her son and putin yesterday on tv....i tend to read both their media and occasionally have one look at their tv channels since i understand russian to see what's most new bullshit they are saying .
6379,dont know about tv but ( according to wikipedia ) official kremlin media is posting stuff like this ( i double checked the translation with google chromes translator )
6380,welcome to nazi propoganda where enemies are both insanely strong and decadent and weak .
6381,that's the essence of fascism
6382,"how come nobody has supplied a source for this statement ... like at all ... ?? i , too , want a link to see this happening , cause it sounds like bullshit , to me ."
6383,"they are brainwashed that origin of their culture is russia . main russian pope said yesterday : ""... "" ""... that's why our nation should especially stay strong around this historical centre of all rus - around city of moscow """
6384,"[ not sure if this is exactly what theyre talking about , but it shares the same sentiment .]("
6385,""" world war 3 - this time we are the nazis """
6386,"and the us has the brainwashed trump supporters that believe anything their demented cult leader says . not the same as russia , but similar brainwashed following ."
6387,"which , of course , will be blamed entirely on the west ( especially good ' ol usa ) with absolutely no mention of ukraine and the fact that the invasion of ukraine and consequential sanctions was the reason ."
6388,and then they'll claim they're innocent victims being attacked by nato for no reason
6389,"lol , thanks for making my day greetings from kharkiv . we will win"
6390,"nato is so badass , they don't even need to go to war to win a war ."
6391,"hah ! if they were at war with nato , they'd * know *"
6392,"its laying the groundwork to justify them ( re)deploying tactical nuclear arms and other weaponry near nato borders because , and im sure this will be something like it , faced with overwhelming western aggression russia had no choice but to defend itself against nazi supporters, or some such tripe ."
6393,russia paid the taliban bounties for killing american soldiers in afghanistan . trump was so far up putins ass that they got away with it . now that hes out of office paybacks a bitch vlad .
6394,"an empty veiled threat . if it is a ' proxy war ', then it's one russia started of its own volition and can end literally any time it wants simply by withdrawing it's genocidal rape squads from ukraine ."
6395,"veiled , or empty ?"
6396,putin got his diploma through sport quota . i doubt he's ever attended to a single lecture in his lifetime .
6397,"it fits the decade-long narrative and his string of actions well . i think he really believes this , and not only him , but at least a hefty 30 % of the population share this vision genuinely ."
6398,"they aren't fighting nato , though , nato's just supplied ukraine with some hand-me-downs from the soviet era , plus some oldish western man-portable weapons . now they are finally sending them some of the nicer new artillery , but that hasn't hit the battlefield yet ."
6399,"well , it's also a continuation of russia's 200-year old language policy . in ukraine 40 % of the population are russophones - it was achieved by bans on ukrainian language and discrimination ."
6400,china does it with cantonese and the other chinese dialects too .
6401,"if nato entered the war , there would likely be no need for ground troops , we would simply sweep the pathetic russian air force from the sky and then just bomb them and their supply lines until they leave or have nothing left for us to bomb . the ukrainians are more than capable themselves of cleaning up any remaining russians hiding in urban areas . edit : concern trolls telling me about mad , don't they see putin is using mad to * invade western countries without any direct defensive action from the west ??*"
6402,"russia : "" we are engaging in war with nato "" nato : "".... who ?"""
6403,"i doubt russia will settle for anything less than the two areas they declared independent and the area they've already captured . putin's dug himself a hole by declaring that , so he's all in . i fear this will be a long bloody war ."
6404,its very likely the donbas will continue to be occupied by russian forces for the next few decades
6405,"small correction , germany was not involved in the winter war . you are thinking of the continuation war , which followed the winter war . the big difference is that finland went on a true offensive in the continuation war , and co-ordinated with the german forces , with germans fighting in the finnish lines as well ."
6406,"there are a number of factors more which makes this different . the world is far more globalized and global trade dependent . and russia is dependent on that global trade for all kinds of stuff which makes their economy run . which russia can only or mostly import from the west . and russia's economy ( and military spending ) is tiny compared to the west . and raw man-power is much less applicable than in earlier conflicts . the whole thing is complete insane and a lost costs for russia . which is why many non-shills said that russia would of course not invade , were just posturing , in spite of the evidence to the contrary leading up to the invasion ."
6407,my interest is also piqued .
6408,"> fusion material . tritium ( h3 ) is the booster for hydrogen bombs and has a short half life of 12.3 years so i would expect it to have a relatively frequent replacement timeframe of years not decades . if it is not replaced , the yield drops by 4 orders of magnitude ([ 100kt to 0.3kt in this example ]("
6409,do you have any sources or good search terms to find out about this stuff ? the difference in western vs russian designs and replacement cycles specifically .
6410,"yeah as much as i agree with people saying almost none of their missiles are likely even functional , the proposition always reminds me of a watchmen quote : > the soviets have 51,000 warheads stockpiled . even if jon stops 99 percent of them , the 1 percent that get through could still kill every living thing on earth ."
6411,"clarify "" bad "" too long to too short ?"
6412,"if we disregard nukes , then this is probably the timeline that we would see . even with nato's overwhelming air power , it would probably still take weeks to make sure that russian ground defenses have been dismantled properly ."
6413,"i genuinely dont see how we're nearly in month 3 of this war and people are still routinely forgetting russian state media is just like this . nothing they say , even if it comes from putin himself , holds any weight until it's acted upon . nato knows this and that's why countries rarely even respond to these threats now . hell , i'm pretty positive they've claimed to be at war with nato already even . unless something big has changed behind the scenes , nato isn't attacking russian territory or putting "" boots on the ground "" in ukraine . the goal is still helping preserve ukraine , not creating a wider conflict ( which , again , providing troops or attacking russia would almost certainly do ). besides people reading too much in to statements , the goal hasn't changed at all since march . i get the threat of global conflict is frightening ( or for some reason , for some people exciting ) but y'all need to start thinking critically . yes , russia ( or nato even ) could act irrationally , but we have at least two months of internal statements/press releases/etc to make assumptions from , and based on all that , this genuinely just seems par for the course"
6414,"guess russia would need to actually declare war against a nato nation or attack them . not sure why russia would want that , besides nuking the world a few aeons back . they couldn't win a conventional war at all ."
6415,"please dont use logic against russian state propaganda . it hurts putins feelings . but seriously , thats just rhetoric . russia is not legally at war with nato . nato is also a defensive organization so nato will only fight russia if the russians attack a member state ."
6416,i mean nothing anymore . they called it a war ...
6417,"pssst , that was last month . flip it before you get reeducated ."
6418,please report immediately to room 101 .
6419,that's weird shit . who decides who's who ? 
6420,they even send a member of the government to ensure your jump goes according to plan
6421,a closed window
6422,suicide by two shots to the back of the head !
6423,"ending up in a ditch , covered in petrol , on fire ."
6424,yeah but they need more boats for their navy . the side they are special operating against has no navy but has somehow managed to sink some of their boats .
6425,imagining reading this with no context .
6426,i like you too . it would be fitting .
6427,polonium
6428,"there are different kinds of corruption . for example , a bribe to avoid red tape on a project or contract is corruption but it can enable growth . whereas embezzlement is more purely negative corruption for a country . not saying both arent principally bad . but not all corruption holds a nation back equally ."
6429,russia cant even manage to take on a ukraine supported with mostly hand-me-down nato weaponry and supported by modern nato intel . their legitimacy as a real threat to europe died in ukraine . the only exception is their nuclear and other missile based systems . their ability to project an ability to handle a two front conventional war - because the us would absolutely hit from the pacific as well - is in shambles .
6430,france has excellent force projection and it still works in its former african francosphere ...
6431,"one of the cornerstones of fascism , according to umberto eco too . the enemy is both all-powerful and extremely feeble ."
6432,that the enemy is simultaneously strong and weak is a common feature of fascism .
6433,"> kind of like people who hate jews . jews control everything and are better at everything but also subhuman and worse in everyway . bigotry doesn't need logic . in fascism , the "" enemy "" is always weak and strong . whatever fuels the narrative . removing the humanity of the perceived enemy makes the genocide easier ."
6434,"fascist narratives require only an out-group scape goat and a system of the in-group constantly dissent purging . contradiction , hypocrisy , are merely optical concerns to overcome . there are no ethics , * hippy *, only the marketable narrative ."
6435,yeah and also we follow a religion invented by jews but at the same time jews suck ?
6436,"ah yes , schrodingers jew , very similar to schrodingers immigrant who simultaneously comes to take our jobs and claim our benefits ."
6437,it's almost as if being an idiot makes it easier to be a bigot
6438,"was watching neil degrasse tyson on the hot ones the other day . i loved his response to sean asking about whether he refutes conspiracy theories like flat earthers . in essence tyson said i don't have time , i could spend the rest of my life just refuting this nonsense . i prefer to focus my attention on educating people so they will never think such things in the first place ."
6439,"i've seen a lot of anti jewish rhetoric on social media lately . i mean it's always been there , but this week alone i've seen like 10 different people saying real nasty shit about jews on twitter . when reported i always seem to get back "" we have found this comment didn't violate the terms of service "" for fucks sake humanity , can we just be chill ?"
6440,you're spot on . i read an article the other day that russia was eliminating ukraine from history books .
6441,"yeah , theres a lot of ukraine has only been a nation for a very short time messaging ."
6442,* oceania was at war with eastasia . oceania had always been at war with eastasia *
6443,that woman is grieving for her son and the 2 options she has are : a ) her beloved child is a proud hero and his death served a bigger purpose b ) her beloved childs life was needlessly ended because stupid reasons and he was amongst the bad guys most likely she's a pawn that gets ruthlessly used
6444,"just google yourself , honestly , it ain't hard to find . the russians are doing the mask-off thing now ."
6445,"i met a qanon dude recently at a dirtbike event .. he started defending russia , said some weird stuff like "" whats the most christian country in the world : russia "". also apparently theres a new conspiracy about trump saying the word "" china "" funny when talking about covid , and its code for ukraine the end of the "" logic "" was that covid actually came from ukraine"
6446,"honestly don't give a shit who they blame it on . why should we entertain their perceptions , instead of just acting according to reality ?"
6447,"greetings from australia , slava ukraini !"
6448,stay strong ! stay safe !
6449,"or russia's just sloppy . like every russia always been , even when they were called something else . throw bodies at the enemies until they stop having bullets"
6450,easier for russia to sell to its people that it's taking losses from this nebulous great western enemy than that it's just losing to ukrainians defending their country .
6451,"it's like a warrant canary , but in reverse , and fueled solely by stupidity . if you're able to post articles to the internet and/or watch television reports regarding the topic "" russia is at war with nato ,"" then russia is * definitely not * at war with nato . if the sky is a thousand times brighter than normal and/or you've been engulfed in a fireball , then russia * might * be at war with nato ."
6452,"indeed...maybe not for long , but they'd know alright ."
6453,we would all know . and it would be terrifying
6454,>( re)deploying tactical nuclear arms and other weaponry near nato borders because the weapons are in kaliningrad for many decades .
6455,"putin was ellbow deep in trumps ass , he played him like a muppet ..."
6456,"simply withdrawing wont be enough at this point . a modern nrnberg with the full cooperation of russia would have to happen for us to stop . otherwise we push russia back to pre 2014 borders , close the seas and air , and encircle their country with missile defenses ."
6457,this is not a proxy war for russia though . just a regular war this time .
6458,i highly doubt a person can maneuver themselves to where vladimir putin is and maintain a set of morals/principles that are in any way based around an external locus . he's a malignant narcissist - there's nothing behind the mask .
6459,"no , he doesn't . he's a lawyer , he ** knows ** this is untrue . his own signature on documents he has signed regarding ukraine proves that he knows . he is a liar and has been at it for a long time , that is the nature of kgb ."
6460,i blame the word caboose
6461,no idea man . i feel like it's getting worse . i often see top comments completely butchered yet no one corrects them . then i gotta feel like a nerd correcting people .
6462,nato would probably cleans the black sea of russian ships and submarines . all done by air .
6463,"i just want to take a moment to appreciate somebody who understands modern military tactics . nato wouldn't need to send ( or spend money on ) an occupying force in ukraine , ukraine is more than capable of occupying her own land . that said , nato would probably have to start placing troops along the russian border . invasion would be off the table so long as nukes are on said table but mad is still the rule of the day ."
6464,you forgot the part about russia firing icbm with nuclear warheads . not as fun .
6465,"correct , thank you . i'm mashing the winter war and continuation war into a single war with three phases , basically . 1 . winter war : finland was almost completely alone against the soviet union . major russian losses in the war , but worsening situation for the finns . peace after loss of territory , but considering that stalin set up a puppet exile government , ambitions were greater in the beginning . 2 . when soviet russia is attacked by germany , finland decides to try to regain their losses . major strides into soviet . 3 . as germany retreats , finland cannot defend their gains , and sues for peace at winter war terms , realizing that holding on to the retaken territory might be impossible . 4 . ( german troops stuck in northern finland becomes a headache )"
6466,"yeah . isolation is very costly for russia in the long run . putin still banks on the european elite ignoring everything but easy cash , and trade recovering soon after peace . he's banking on that the west wants peace , regardless of the political cost , since in his view geopolitical aims are all over the place and not coordinated . only greed is constant ."
6467,* the precious tritium *
6468,don't most bombs use something like lithium to form the tritium ?
6469,"its a bit more of an issue than that . surprisingly , * small * bombs rely on fusion , ie you can make a lower yield hydrogen bomb than you can for a pure fission bomb . but when you get down to that level ( normally for a tactical weapon ), a drop in the available fusion material could stop the weapon working entirely ."
6470,i still don't want a 300 ton bomb dropped on my city !
6471,"well , it's 4400 now and 1 % is still enough to destroy every major city in the us ."

6477,at this point im not sure russia could win a potato sack race .
6478,"by saying that russia is at war with nato , putin is declaring war on nato . if not then shouldnt this be a crime as he said war "
6479,but isnt declaring that you are at war with someone .. you know a declaration of war ?
6480,"incorrect . nato intervened in my country ( serbia , then yugoslavia ), and we didn't attack any nato member , and they even bypassed un to do so . it's all a power play . russia declaratively sided with us then ( they made some angry notes about it , until some of their debt was written off ), but they wouldn't confront nato . what russia didn't learn from it , before starting this bloody war , is that even when the whole world was against tiny serbia , and 19 mightiest states on the planet bombed us , they still didn't achieve all they wanted . nato also planned it to last 3-4 days , but it lasted 78 days . ukraine is much stronger against russia than serbia was against nato , plus has the support of nato . coffins are piling up for literally nothing . putin will not go down in history just as a villain , but also the greatest idiot being the head of state , ever ."

6510,"when putin justified the invasion of ukraine , his argument were imperialistic and nationalistic . and seemed to be deeply felt . since that is the argument given by putin , and the only reason given which makes internal sense , i think that is genuinely the reason . the invasion certainly does not make economic sense . so russia , or at least putin himself , do not seem to operate with greed as the main motivator . russia has raised the fear of continuing conquests . i don't really see europe going back to business as usual without changes in russia ."

"
6556,"and thats assuming russian tanks can even get close enough to nato territory in sufficient enough numbers ? russian airforce most technological fighter , the su 57 , only has 3 operational units . their top 3 most capable fighters , the sukiho su35s , the su34 and su27 combined are 332 units . the united states alone fields 415 f-35as and f-22 raptors . russia cant even stand up to nato because we havent been waiting around to fight them on our soil . theres a reason why nato operates 5 times more early warning aircraft . we have geared our methods of war to hit the russians the moment they decide to exit their bases heading towards nato territory . in a conflict with the russians , they wont manage to cross the sulwki region . we would pulverize any russian forces before they even get anywhere close to the borders . they cant even subdue ukraine , have you seen what the nato allies did in iraq in a week time thousands of miles away from their bases ? im very confused why people think russia is a military threat , they cant take down a rat if it carried a knife , let alone be capable of causing any harm to a nato alley before the combined nato forces would reduce their advancing forces to dust"
6557,"> berlins approach has support among other western allies : concerned by the cost of long-term deployments and the possibility of provoking moscow , they argue that pre-positioning some equipment and flying in troops at short notice is the smarter move this is similar to the uk's defence approach to the falkland islands . the problem with this defence is : 1 ) it relies on good intelligence and a belief that it is necessary to "" pull the trigger "" and commence the operation . we saw with ukraine that european intelligence was shoddy and actions were delayed so as "" not to antagonise "" russia even as it completed its own build-up . 2 ) without sufficient missile defence russian strikes could take out the airfields and any pre-positioned equipment sitting in warehouses before nato soldiers arrive to disperse it . at which point you're back to racing to the suwalki gap . 3 ) multiple countries coming together to provide rapid reinforcement is complex . you have to seriously commit to it and be willing to carry out full-scale exercises , not just write a theoretical paper ."
6558,you know what would help with that before they have more permanent defenses ? swe & fin in nato .
6559,"judging from ukraine , it doesn't matter if it's 6 days or 6 months to get tanks there , the us airforce will have destroyed what you're going to fight within 6 hours . the only question is if the us navy can get there first ."
6560,"the difference is that if russia starts a war in estonia , it will be concluded in moscow ."
6561,"honestly , permanent bases with troops on long term rotation is a good idea . yeah it's expensive but that's part of the significant change in military spending that many european countries already need to make , military spending is a recurring bill , not a one time lump sum . not only does it significantly reinforce the flank but provides , at least with american bases as the example , a large economic influx for the host country as well as a significant cultural exchange . that's what happens when you send large populations of your people to work and live abroad . for a europe , a western world , that is seeking to become ever more entwined and close knit , these are good things . the economic simulation in the eastern countries would then be consequently fed back to western europe in trade and tourism , the cultural exchange would strengthen bonds and homogenize "" western culture "" more , it's a win in so many ways ."
6562,wouldn't it be easier to just not have russia in the first place ?
6563,"the only reason we're afraid of provoking moscow is because of these principles that underpin liberal hegemony which call for non-aggression . frankly , russia acts like a rabid dog and they should be afraid of provoking us , not the other way around . we shouldn't be afraid of provoking the rabid dog which may come and bite us . the damned dog should be afraid that we're going to come out there and shoot it ."
6564,"why do i recently feel like uk is a better eastern europe ally than western europe countries ? they left eu , they are the last one country russia would attack . why do they care so much ?"
6565,"as estonian , i must say that i am slightly worried "
6566,"i mean we did have at least a few weeks of warning with russia amassing their army on the border . ukraine choose to call their "" bluff "" ( and then it wasn't a bluff ), probably to avoid provoking a war , but there was time to prepare if they had chosen to . my takeaway from that is that it's important to start preparing for the worst as soon as signs start showing up . it's not that we need permanently stationed troops near the border so we can avoid having to prepare before the attack happens .. 60 days is too much , sure . but like 2 weeks is not unreasonable . there's really no way russia can keep an operation of that size hidden for that long ."
6567,"station a uk , german , and french armored brigade to form a division , along side a polish one and an american one . there's basically no way for russia to beat that ."
6568,"still reading that line "" fear of provoking russia "" is such a fucking joke at this point . it really just makes everyone that uses it sound so weak and pathetic . how can they be afraid of provoking something that already started . they are that delusional about it still ?"
6569,russia needs 60 daya to get some tanks there too so we're good . ruskies have pulled all forces to ukraine front . there is not much on the baltics border atm . that's why they are showin off and breaking air space with that one attack heli . to pretend that they have forces there
6570,doubt this will ever happen
6571,also need an increase in nato military production capacity .
6572,"allthough i wouldn't mind , you saw this one coming for months . plenty of time to get your units there . russia was sending their troops west en we knew it so don't go with your we had no time bullshit ."
6573,the nato forces in the baltics are not intended to stop ruzzia but to make it clear that any adventure into the baltics will result in killing military from nato and remove the lingering hope from ruzzia that they might get away because some nato countries would neglect their duty . so it was to make sure ruzzia did not do stupid thing based on miscalculations on nato resolve . as a military force they were not to halt any significant all out russian offensive ..( with the pre ukraine assessment of ruzzian military strength altleast ). with more troops nearby and a more sober assessment of ruzzian capabilities it might limit the initial territories lost . but still being the battlefield with one of the fighting parties having no qualms of targeting civilians with artillery makes additional quick reaction forces needed to limit the time that ruzzians can continue their butcher work..atleast in a conventional war ..
6574,if only there were two large nations nearby which could join nato ...
6575,> you dont have 60 days to get your tanks to estonia is this a reference to reforger ? i don't know the timescales planned for reinforcing from the us .
6576,"i mean georgia , armenia need to be in nato as well ."
6577,and after there is no estonia there is no russia anymore since the nato will delete them from the map
6578, feel like in a situation where russia attacks baltics full force nato/usa will let them go or something i hope they dont
6579,"so on the one hand : russian army sucks on the other estonia will be gone in 60 days come on , at least pick 1 narrative"
6580,"do you really need a significant number of tanks there ? the bulk of russian army was stopped by motivated soldiers , some atgms and just total russian incompetence . heavy armour is kept back from the front anyway because of potential quick airstrikes and because of not being overrun . after some days when front stabilized , russian air space plus defence is already cleared . then it just rains bombs from the air . by mrls , helis and planes , basically wrecking everything . tanks are only needed with a massive push through lines and just clean up the rest ."
6581,"this will fit putin's narrative completely . i agree that it's needed though , but it would be nice if it could be done in a way that look organizes local forces in a clear defensive posture so he could not spin it ."
6582,well maybe nato should avoid provocating russia .
6583,says the defence secretary whos army is shrinking faster than the polar ice caps .
6584,this podcast is good :
6585,"for a non-nuclear country , a deterrent on par with the nuclear threat would be biological weapons . i do not condone biological warfare or breaking international treatises ( well , any country can opt out from a treatise ), but what is our defence ? that could be used as a deadman hand in case of being nuked . maybe , like in a sci-fi-esque / technothriller-like scenario , we ( the smaller non-nuclear countries ) should have infiltrated sleeper agents in the enemy territory , "" loaded "" with ebola and other highly-contagious high-mortality pathogens and if russia goes nuclear , we go ... viral . the least we can do if we're nuked . i know , that'd be cruel and against international law ( would indiscriminately target military and civilians ) but so are nuclear missiles . and who would be left to judge the ( international ) law anyway ? only the aggressor ?"
6586,"if russia closes the suwalki gap , any nato forces in the baltic states would be cut off and surrounded . in the event of a war , i'd wager the russians would prioritize closing the suwalki gap and defending kaliningrad before entering the baltic states ."
6587,but how long has russia been gathering their tanks by ukrainian border ? it's not like they can move at lightning speed either .
6588,"with such a big alliance you'll always need time to coordinate efforts . and that time , in military terms , is always either bought with space or lives ."
6589,> you dont have 60 days to get your tanks to estonia . because by that stage there will be no estonia given what the russians have done in ukraine. i don't really understand this logic . first of all it wouldn't take 60 days to move tanks to estonia . second the war in ukraine has shown that the russian armed forces are incompetent . it shows that russia is less of a military threat than we thought
6590,"baltic states are supreme nato leeches and need to start spending real money or be kicked out . put together the three of them have nearly 6 million people and a gdp of 147 billion dollars , yet none of them operate any tanks or fighter jets , while croatia with a population of 3.8 million people and a gdp of 68 billion dollars just acquired rafales . it's prime time that baltics stop begging for assistance and actually invest in their military . why should rets of nato help them when they're not willing to make even the most basic of sacrifices ."
6591,does ukraine honestly not realise how nato fights ? or any other modern military . tanks are completely useless in our strategy . instead we use overwhelming air power to first destroy anything that could oppose our aircraft . and then use that supremacy to destroy pretty much any other military target . we arent conquerors anymore nor do we want to as any invasion is beyond useless .
6592,russia built up forces on the border of ukraine for weeks before attacking . could you not just move nato troops to the baltics the moment you see a buildup of russian forces near the border ?
6593,fear of provoking moscow we shouldnt say that anymore at this point moscow is provoking is and wecawnser they should treat caredully not us wecare the bear in the room not russia
6594,"> their top 3 most capable fighters , the sukiho su35s , the su34 and su27 combined are 332 units . also half of these probably dont even fly . they've been struggeling to defeat the ukranian airforce which consisted of like 200 cold war era jets . i really dont get why people are scared of a full on russian invasion . just europe alone could probably completly burger them , adding in the us air force as well would be straight up bullying lmao . what we should prepare for are small russian provocations and border conflicts . imagine them occupying a strip of land like in crimea , then replying its always been russian clay and that theyll go full on nuclear war if we try to take it back . however thats still nothing a well protected border with a fast response force in the area cant solve ."
6595,i think main idea why stationing brigade in lithuania is not possible because we lack proper infrastructure for it - from places to train and sleep all the way up to providing air defences for staging areas
6596,"i think point 1 is the key point , its the same idea behind a continuos at sea nuclear deterrent , if its not always available and ready to go , you have to decide when to make it ready , and that can be seen as a key escalation . much better to have it always ready to go"
6597,the russian invasion of ukraine perfectly illustrated how striking targets on the opening day may difficult in terms of effect . and mind you ukraine did not have full comprehensive access to intelligence of western countries or the vast range of intelligence gathering tools that the west does .
6598,"> this is similar to the uk's defence approach to the falkland islands . the uk has almost 1200 troops on the falklands . that's not a small number , and the situation isn't exactly the same . one sub can shut down a navy as it did in 1982 , and their air defence is top of the range . defending islands is different ."
6599,** side eyeing turkey **
6600,"or ukraine . a country with most experienced fighters against main natos enemy close . deployment can be done through poland . not sure about logistics , but no one fought russians more than ukraine after ww2"
6601,shame sweden and finland have left it till now to apply then .
6602,"or start a new defense pact with uk , ukraine , poland , finland , sweden etc ."
6603,"yes , that would be one of the big differences between a war russia vs ukraine and russia vs nato . nato would have air superiority . and while it may take a while to move in heavy ground units planes are there significantly faster ."
6604,"the us navy , the only navy in the world which has its own army and its own air force ."
6605,"yeah , the us air force is fully capable of hitting any target anywhere on earth within 24 hours . some areas also have access to expedited delivery ."
6606,"> the us airforce will have destroyed what you're going to fight within 6 hours . even then baltic countries would be "" conquered "" by russia and would need to be retaken . baltic countries are quite "" shallow "" in military ops terms ."
6607,"that's assuming a democrat wins the 2024 elections , otherwise the us won't do shit and kick nato's ass . ... and i'm pretty sure a lot of americans , democrats as republicians alike , would love to see their country stop playing world police"
6608,with american troops . europe needs to take care of its own defense .
6609,"probably not . nato doctrine is to push an invading force back to the internationally recognized border but not beyond . doesn't mean they may not temporarily cross the border to achieve a particular objective , doesn't mean that they wouldn't conduct airstrikes well beyond the border . but if nato follows it's own doctrine it would not occupy any non-member territory for any significant time ."
6610,"no one needs or even wants to roll into moscow . it will be enough to stop the offensive and roll back up to the border in a limited engagement . then what ? they won't be replacing those losses any time soon and if they decide to keep lobbing srbms you target the launchers until they run out . by keeping the engagement limited to what is needed to neutralize their threats as they come up , instead off rolling into the country you keep the risk and necessity for a fatal escalation minimized . mounting a full scale ground offensive it even a large air offensive deep into russia is the stupidest reaction nato could choose , it would not be strictly necessary and maximally dangerous ."
6611,"no need , ww3 won't be fought primarily with soldiers , it will be fought with aircraft and missiles . there is no need to send soldiers if you can send a rocket to bomb whatever you want"
6612,major boot gets it . someone get him/her promoted to colonel boot .
6613,"theres very little cultural exchange to be honest , the us troops are basically completely isolated from the country theyre staying in because everything they need is available on their bases"
6614,"unpopular opinion - peace is much less costly . lets suppose , for a moment , the us and its allies had poured money into the former ussr at the close of the cold war . what would that have cost ? the current situation is such a depressing contrast to the high hopes for a cordial bilateral relationship and the emergence of a stable , peaceful , and cooperative europe that marked the demise of the soviet union three decades ago ."
6615,"that's true , but playing the game of being the snappiest dog in the neighbourhood requires to regularly make an example of some small country to show we're still the top dog . and it's that kind of entanglements that we want to avoid ."
6616,"the uk is not nearly as tied to russia for trade and energy as central europe . i think that's what leaves them free to pursue the current foreign policy . they might not be in the eu anymore , but they will always be europeans and remain very much affected by the security of the continent as a whole . that and there is probably a good deal of showboating to claw back some relevance and make in-roads for when the shooting stops . ukraine will one day need to be rebuilt and the uk might call in some favours to get the contracts ."
6617,"if russia was releasing nerve agents and highly radioactive substances in french and german tourist spots , and then openly laughing about it afterwards then they would probably (?) have woken up early to putins russia as well . any putin supporters reading this , dont think our antipathy for you is all politicians in london . the general uk population knows what youve been doing and youve made an enemy . londongrad is history ."
6618,> why do i recently feel like uk is a better eastern european ally than western europe countries we always have been . estonian independence was possible because of the royal navy . we declared war on germany in support of poland ( but unfortunately our actual support was limited : see the phony war ). nevertheless churchill after ww2 wanted the americans and british to continue on into the soviet union to liberate the eastern europe . we have always been and always will be an ally to eastern europe against russian aggression .
6619,acab has said nearly exactly the same one month ago during her visit in the baltics .
6620,uk has historically been one of cees closest allies . unlike france they actually apologized for 1938 even though they technically didn't have a obligation to defend us ( unlike france ).
6621,"uk politics are complex and the factions inside each party are endless . the government boris built isn't the best for uk at the moment , but it's internationally much stronger than the previous 4 . also uk has had a strong case of "" wefuckedup""-itis due to the whole wmd in irak thing where they lied together with us to the half of nato that wanted to listen , so until very recently they've been rather a quiet member of the alliance . they probably see that now it's their time to shine , become relevant players again , pass germany from the left in the autobahn of geostrategical leadership and thus , have more leverage into deals with europe . because after all of this , there's no way east europe won't support some trade deal with uk ."
6622,because the english hate russia and their feud goes back centuries .
6623,> why do they care so much ? we don't like bullies .
6624,"because you read mainly english news , ~~ england's ~~ uk's position will be more promoted . nato got eight battlegroup in eastern europe : > the eight battlegroups are composed of the following allies : >** host nation : bulgaria ** > framework nation : bulgaria > contributing nations : united states >** host nation : estonia ** > framework nation : united kingdom > contributing nations : denmark and france >** host nation : hungary ** > framework nation : hungary > contributing nations : croatia and the united states >** host nation : latvia ** > framework nation : canada > contributing nations : albania , the czech republic , italy , montenegro , poland , slovakia , slovenia and spain >** host nation : lithuania ** > framework nation : germany > contributing nations : belgium , the czech republic , iceland , luxembourg , the netherlands and norway >** host nation : poland ** > framework nation : united states > contributing nations : croatia , romania and the united kingdom >** host nation : romania ** > framework nation : france > contributing nations : belgium , poland , portugal and the united states >** host nation : slovakia ** > framework nation : the czech republic > contributing nations : germany and the netherlands"
6625,* crimean war flashbacks *
6626,> why do they care so much ? uk ( and the tories ) are very anti-russian government and have been for many years . uk really cares about democracy in europe and the right of small nations to defend themselves . this hasn't changed . leaving the eu did not really change any of this .
6627,"i wish irish people could be somewhat similar , but most are still stuck in the fantasy land of being neutral ."
6628,germany and france are a joke . atleast uk is fully supporting ukraine .
6629,well its germany that has announced to be increasing its presence in lithuania first so 
6630,"we're rather strongly attached to the idea of defending democracy , due to wwii . we're happy to intervene in other areas because we still feel we should be relevant the world over , as some of us are still clinging on to the old empire . and nowadays , the values we stand for aren't based on colonialism , but democracy"
6631,"you realise this is about nato and not the eu , right ?"
6632,"because despite what the legions of french and german users on here would have you believe the uk actually believes in the defence of europe . don't forget both france and germany have tried to conquer all of europe before as they believe its their ' right ' to rule over europe . uk on the other hand never really cared about large land campaigns and conquering all of europe but focused on mercantilism around the world instead . big wars are bad for business . uk cares because uk has always believed in there being a balance of power in the world so as to allow trade to flow and them to make money off their lucrative colonial trade . uk has always opposed one large power having too much influence or control over all of europe , because they know that most european powers would love nothing more than to conquer the uk itself . meanwhile the uk at the height of its powers made 0 attempts or plans to conquer all of europe like france and germany did at their height , because they simply don't care . its partly why brexit happened , because while france and germany see the eu as a way to ' lead ' europe and control other european nations , the uk had a view of ' forget about europe '. on the contrast france and germany have always viewed it as their dream to be the ' rulers ' of europe and are willing to sacrifice eastern europe if it means they retain more influence or their own power ."
6633,because it deflects from the bad politics in the own country . war is always good for politicians and boris fucked his own country pretty up
6634,"because france and germany are useless af , the uk stands out favourably in comparison ."
6635,"because the shout a lot . their action are heavily publicised even on minor things . they pat themselves in the back . part of it is to undermine the eu , the other part is to refesh their international standing after the aukus submarines story , brexit , and the many buffonneries of bojo ."
6636,the uk has a long history of protecting far away nations . with great power comes great responsibility .
6637,"old rivalry with russia that the russians are much more interested in maintaining , the germans have for the longest time felt that they need to be nice to russia because of the war and the french have believed that russia can be a counter balance against china and the us so they should have friendly relations with them"
6638,"> why do they care so much ? they are trying to play global game as global player . and it seems to work . uk itself is not a real global power . but thanks to very very active engagement in defence of ukraine it is perceived as that . western europe ( or core eu ) on the other hand , plays global game with different goals . for for them russian invasion of ukraine is a long term disaster , undermining the chances of eu playing as equal with us and china ."
6639,"because bragging a lot and waving empty russian threat create a nice feeling among your people and destabilise the eu . i guess you have no idea how many soldiers of each citizenship are in the different baltic states , for how long , why and why it is their turn , but wallace spoke last and won . words are cheap ."
6640,"regardless of nato and eu the uk have defense treaties with a few eastern european countries , poland and estonia of the top of my head , possibly more ? also the russians have killed quite a few people on british soil which the uk isn't too happy about ."
6641,"> why do i recently feel like uk is a better eastern europe ally than western europe countries ? if we're being honest i's always been the uk . they pushed to add poland and the rest of the east to nato too . > they left eu , they are the last one country russia would attack . why do they care so much ? the uk commitment to nato is not linked to the eu , and a chemical weapon was used by russia less then 5 years ago on uk soil . i can see why they would care . the response from them has been fantastic though ."
6642,i mean we do just love a good war . i'm sure the rest of western europe are there to help in other ways but when it comes to warfare we're all about it
6643,cause the uk has been russia's kryptonite since the 1850s
6644,"i believe british and us got a more militaristic culture overall . when the us invaded iraq , uk joined happily even though the casus belli was dubious - supposed weapons of mass destructions were never found after all - and france vetoed the war , meaning the us [ couldn't really invade iraq legally ]( ( but they did so anyway ) meanwhile the eu is seen as the reason there was no war in europe since 1945 - and i must say the pacifist culture is pretty strong , even more so after the fuck ups in africa to implement democracies . the big idea is to intertwine economies worldwide so it would cost too much for everyone to wage a war , making it unprofitable . we saw how that works , though , and west eu is starting to relearn that diplomacy doesn't work when soldiers are at the border ( quoting bismark here , i believe ). and that defending others can sometimes require fast and decisive actions , while our culture of discussion , concessions and negotiation is undermining it . waking from this slumber will take a while and i don't see it happening before one year to be fair . meanwhile british and us proved they more adepts of taking risks and to be decisives . so yes you're right . i just hope that will change soon ."
6645,"> they left eu , they are the last one country russia would attack . why do they care so much ? because it allows them to be "" important "" at low cost . > why do i recently feel like uk is a better eastern europe ally than western europe countries ? because economic ties between russia and uk is only money laundering , not an actual energy market that they depend on . shell/bp still buy russian oil , tho . it also isn't recent . uk and russia were competitors since empire times . churchill wanted to invade ussr right after ww2 , etc . uk however just like russia pretty much paper tigers . yeah , russia wrecking ukraine and it could've been in my opinion avoided if only all parties actually worked on mutual solution and not shitface diplomacy , but expecting any kind of high class diplomacy since 90s is kinda naive , i guess , but russia can't hold ukraine . simply no military personal and % of ukrainians that would align with russians are lower than those that won't . uk on the other hand may support ukraine publicly and with credits , but i doubt they military capable of active fight against russia . iirc naval battleship gone to repair after 4 years in port ? majority of the countries that invaded me were fighting locals that were far behind in tech and ukraine-russia conflict is the first conflict of more or less equal combatants . considering that russians started with the idea that they will capture kiev and zelensky will flee and not with the idea of actual full on attack destruction plan that us utilized in iraq - we can't really be sure what would've happened if preparations were better . ukraine confirmed that in a period of 24 february 23 may 2022 there was 4600 deaths among civilians , estimates obviously higher , but we won't know until the end what exact numbers there . which is about 3 months . same period in 2003 iraq there was 7960 deaths among civilians . overall pretty sure that nato and china taking notes ."
6646,because uk is having a shit time lately and all this jingoism is great to distract people . thought that was pretty obvious .
6647,"he's not talking about tomorrow . when you're defining defense policy , it's always about 30-40 years or more in the future . russia has egg on its face * now *. that doesn't mean it won't spend the next 30 years rebuilding it's military into a force that legitimately can threaten europe . hope for the best , prepare for the worst , you know ?"
6648,inadequate defensive force is provocative . russia might just want to invade conventionally and then start nuclear threats to solidify their gains . that's why adequate conventional forces are needed to prevent that .
6649,"if russia takes estonia or lithuania or whatever and declares a nuclear response to further action of nato in that territory , then it is very very very unlikely that nato would start lobbing nuclear missiles at russia . they would have to back down , because the war for that country would be already lost and nobody would sign up for a nuclear war trying to retake it . conventional forces have to be able to repel the invasion ."
6650,but wouldn't it be much better for estonia not to get turned into a smoking crater to start with ?
6651,europe got trip wire soldiers there . for example if you attack lithuanian you would kill some german soldiers also . dead german soldiers are a thing nobody really wants . nobody !!!
6652,obvious bot account is obvious .
6653,"putin can spin everything he wants anyway . russia invaded ukraine because of ukrainian biolabs infecting birds with a plague killing only russians , who are same people as ukrainians . their gay nazi jews invented ukrainian nation ."
6654,biological is very hard to control . nuke goes off in a specific place . by spreading some deadly virus you can literally end human population by accident .
6655,biological weapons are a novelty they serve no tactical purpose . most research into bio weapons on all sides wasnt offensive but was defensive because they were afraid that someone might develop them . like many other programs it was also abused by scientists to get funding for research no one else would otherwise fund . no one was or is creating a doomsday virus in a lab somewhere not as a weapon at least .
6656,us military logistics are air and naval not land based . even in ww2 it used to parachute everything from ammunition to chocolate and whiskey even to soldiers behind enemy lines . ever since they never fought a war where the primarily logistics channels were overland because they never had a war near their borders . the russians are also incapable of achieving air superiority over western forces so an air corridor would always remain open .
6657,"> if russia closes the suwalki gap , any nato forces in the baltic states would be cut off and surrounded . it would just as much create a tentacle of russian troops that is just as easily cut off and surrounded . they don't even need to do that , the baltic states have no strategic depth to begin with . they need naval backup both for the missile backup and to keep their coastal supply and escape lines clear . therefore , watching the baltic for submarines and submarine drones is critical . > i'd wager the russians would prioritize closing the suwalki gap and defending kaliningrad before entering the baltic states . once they overrun the baltic states the suwalki gap becomes irrelevant as well . they'll just use kaliningrad as a launch platform to distract ."
6658,its been doing that for months by covering it up behind '' military exercises '' that it supposedly did in belarus......its a old soviet tactic where they gather up forces for '' exercises '' but at the same time could easily rearm those troops and sent them into war with little notice
6659,i checked their military spending and maybe you should have . the baltic states have all increased their spending in % of gdp for the past 10 years . from 1 % to a bit more than 2 % now :
6660,"> baltic states are supreme nato leeches and need to start spending real money or be kicked out . latvia , lithuania and estonia all meet the 2 % gdp spending requirement ."
6661,"they all spend 2 % of their gdp , don't they ? they can't help that they are a small country ."
6662,"dude , we meet 2 % gdp requirement and we are increasing our budget ."
6663,"> baltic states are supreme nato leeches and need to start spending real money or be kicked out . jesus , what a lying xenophobe ..."
6664,no wonder nato is so keen on having finland and sweden as members . to be honest as a finn i have zero interest in serving as cannon fodder in the baltics until uncle sam arrives ( if arrives )
6665,"> while croatia with a population of 3.8 million people and a gdp of 68 billion dollars just acquired rafales . most of croatian army is armed with leftoverts it got for free when yugoslavia collapsed , so i dont think thats any decent example . baltic states had to buy everything themselves from zero with almost no interional support . almost all of croatian army tanks and ifv and artillery it got in its arsenal right now were not paid for by croatian government , it was all taken from yugoslavian stocks in 1990's . also french '' sold '' those rafales to croatia with a massive massive discount . they didn't offer such options to others , and also those m2 bradley ifv's croatia recent got were also practically given to croatia by americans for free ( croatia paid nothing for it ). so tell me again who is a leech here ? > it's prime time that baltics stop begging for assistance and actually invest in their military . all 3 baltic states spend well over 2 % of gdp on the military........croatia in 2022 spent only 1,5 % on theirs . so who is the leech here ?"
6666,because russia invading whoever they want is totally acceptable ? wtf are you on ???
6667,"> tanks are completely useless in our strategy they aren't . that's why usa has 6,612 tanks . > instead we use overwhelming air power to first destroy anything that could oppose our aircraft . which takes time ( see iraq for example , and iraq was useless compared to russia ). we're talking weeks at least . in that time russia can take whole estonia or lithuania if they aren't defended by land forces . will nato bomb the baltic states till the last russian invader ? that will destroy them . and russia will just do what it did in mariupol - kidnap people from baltic states and forcibly move them to siberia , replacing them with russians . what will nato do to return the status quo ? > we arent conquerors anymore nor do we want to as any invasion is beyond useless . how do you plan to retake the land taken over by russia , then ? with air force alone ? air superiority is crucial , but without land forces it can't win wars against a relatively modern army . also - russia humiliated itself in ukraine , but we shouldn't be too optimistic basing on that one example . russian leadership vastly overestimated their chances against ukraine and pursued a very ambitious plan with not enough soldiers . national defense can't rely on the enemy making the same mistake twice ."
6668,"ukraine is much larger , the surround-style buildup included putting many troops in belarus . russia needs to build much less troops at their western border of the eu to have a significant overmatch . then we'll have a game where they conduct an exercise of putting enough to have an overwhelming advantage and perhaps say "" psyche !"" later . already at each of these exercises the proper response would be for nato to enforce their border area , move the troops and if the first time ( and before ) nothing happens it will strengthen the voices of useful idiots saying we are "" escalating "" and "" provoking """
6669,"the buildup time would be a lot shorter ( 1-2 weeks instead of 8 weeks ) and once they've actually crossed the border there's no strategic depth or population enough to stop the russian army in the baltic states . also , only the us has the power projection necessary to move in troops with enough numbers and speed to make a real difference . so the nato response force and its very high readiness joint task force were created to make exactly this kind of difference . it's basically impossible to completely defend the baltic states unless you turn these nations into military bases with an entirely different level of committment . so instead there's constant surveillance and trip-wire forces to give the longest possible warning and definitely trigger nato defence . needless to say the addition of sweden and finland to nato is critically important for the defence of the baltic region since it would allow constant air and naval support as well as many other strategic possibilities which would otherwise be more difficult , more dangerous , or politically unfeasible ."
6670,??
6671,sorry for my fucked up english my phone does wierd shit and i cant read/write ^^
6672,r/ihadastroke
6673,"its mostly the cost , equipement and personal side . to build a wall of defenses bases along side the nato border will very very expensive and demanding . that money and resources can also be used to increases respond time and overal strenght . and most country would rather improve their own millitary and hold full controll over it instead of tying loads of resources up in a other nation . thats one of the biggest arguments against a european army ( which also could help with this problem )."
6674,you'll be amazed what a few billion dollars do to fix little problems like that .
6675,looks like that's already in the works :
6676,i have the solution to this problem ! give them shovels and tell them where to start digging .
6677,"so far , efp is working on the scales applied right now . i'm wondering if it would be possible for an even further expanded presence "" eefp "" to be housed in temporary bases on rotation or if we're at a point where even more nato troops on baltic ground is no longer tenable without proper , fixed housing . it's definitely not great , but i guess still better than keeping capacity in western europe , waiting to deploy in case of escalation and having to go through the "" is it time to react now or is the threshold not met yet "" dance every time russia moves some btgs around the borders ."
6678,turkey's erdogan ( putin's buddy ) knows exactly what he's doing ( putin's job ) by objecting to the nato membership of sweden and finland .
6679,"real shame for nato , yes . or did you reply to the wrong person ?"
6680,"lol what ? even disregarding whole russia situation , how is natos security our problem when we arent members"
6681,you sound american .
6682,"shame that we were constantly told that doors are open and joining would be swift . its almost as if nato told us that we dont have to hurry , that we would be welcome anytime ."
6683,"no , i think the biggest difference would be that such a war would result in the end of civilization in total nuclear annihilation ."
6684,"us navy , 4th biggest air force in the world ."
6685,> some areas also have access to expedited delivery . amazon prime ?
6686,lithunian defense doctrin trying to fix that . there is civilian resistance . civies do everything i nthey power to slow down enemy and make they lives miserable . armed forces is design to make slow down enemy in make them fight for every meter so cavalry would have time to come in . phz2000 and marders for fast skirmish to make them stuck in chokepoints .
6687,"that's what i would fear too . if it would have been "" totally illogical and foolish for russia "" back then to invade ukraine and still did so , even bombing civilians , then what sort of sanity can we expect from kremlin in the future ? although there is a serious resistance in ukraine and it is not going for russian troops as planned , the territory that is already occupied right now was done so within the first 2-3 days for the most part . the front-lines currently lie behind a territory bigger and more populous than the three baltic states combined . all part of ukraine before late february . even if nato could retake the territories , i'm not sure kremlin sees it like that exactly . before russian troups could be pushed back closer to the borders , well...look what they did to ukrainian civilians . not even mentioning lesser problems like infrastructure and others ."
6688,even then ? they'll both be destroyed * and * have taken over the country ?
6689,"you kind of need soldiers on the ground to keep territory , though ."
6690,"idk , i was in tallinn a few weeks ago and the place is basically a finno-american colony . all your hear are finns and americans . finnish liqour tourists and us marines . a hell of a combo ."
6691,"not what everyone's experience is , and i've spent a * lot * of time on base . as a matter of fact , my very existence is the result of this cultural exchange , and you can talk to people ( locals ) who lived in areas where the bases were and hear about how the economy boomed , the locale was safer , and times were more exciting . maybe with online shopping the retail end of things is different now , but put a bunch of young guys with no responsibility and disposable income in an area and watch the cultures get to know eachother over the process of decades . unfortunately only host countries really get to see it this way as they see the overall impact whereas the stationed soldiers have individual perspectives , and the us is not host to foreign bases , a fact i've often lamented ."

6693,"hard disagree . the us has put 4 peer competitors into the trash bin of history in the last 100 years . imperial germany , imperial japan , nazi germany and the former soviet union . is there any serious question as to who is the biggest and baddest in the yard ? even todays china and russia are essentially built on grievances against western liberal ( ie american coastal elite ) hegemony ."
6694,"they called it *** the great game ***. like shit , how come modern stuff doesnt get cool ass names anymore ?"
6695,what if i tell you that the cold war ( and the current situation as well ) is essentially a continuation of the great game .
6696,also the whole bringing radiological and chemicals weapons in to the country
6697,"it has long been the uk's policy to maintain a balance of power in europe that would prevent the rise of a continental empire that could threaten britain . they make alliances both on and off the continent to maintain this balance . they did it with napoleon , hitler , stalin , and now putin . this creates a coincidence of interest between eastern europe and the uk , because both know russia will never stop trying to conquer its neighbors . even if russia only takes the donbas now , they will come back for the rest of ukraine sooner or later . then the rest of eastern europe . and then they'll try for all of continental europe , putting russia on the opposite shore of the english channel . since an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure , the uk might as well align with eastern europe to nip that threat in the bud before it becomes a more immediate issue . it's a good proactive foreign policy that also happens to align with human interests on the ground in ee ."

6704,"if you put aside your emotionality , biasedness and entitlement you'll clearly see why france never cared and still really doesn't care much about cee . the catholics and protestants of cee have been simping for germans for over a millenia , in every imaginable way . so why on earth would france care about czechoslovakia in 1938 , just 20 years after france was in a war versus austria-hungary were the czechs and slovaks made up an integral and vital part ? a war that cost france millions of dead lifes and were the cee gladly followed their german overlords into it . the audacity for you guys to demand anything from france is really astonishing . ofc they won't apologise , cause they never cared about czechs and slovaks , rather the accord between france and czechoslovakia was to try to contain the atrocity that was germany at the time . nothing more ."

6717,"btw , after watching one month ago the press conference of landsbergis and acab i was wondering : is he single ? ;) both were a bit flirty . and both are very good looking for politicians . :)"
6718,"yeah , "" presence in lithuania "" by deploying in germany ."
6719,"> we're rather strongly attached to the idea of defending democracy , due to wwii . lol what . we've taken part in or approved of multiple operations to overthrow democratic governments ( e.g . iran , chile , congo ) and worked with countless dictatorships when it suited us ( indonesia under suharto , argentina , brazil , the aforementioned chile , gaddafi , saddam to name a few ) since wwii . i'm glad the uk is supporting ukraine but let's not get carried away ."
6720,"yes , but leaving eu is kinda move away from continental europe . one could think they care less now ."
6721,"> uk on the other hand never really cared about large land campaigns and conquering all of europe because it knew it wasn't doable . > but focused on mercantilism around the world instead . instead , it only occupied gibraltar , malta , cyprus ... small pieces of land they could hold on to . > big wars are bad for business . except when they're a war against your rival . in that case , wars are amazing . or so you would think , judging by all the times the uk went to war in europe without the issue involving them . > uk cares because uk has always believed in there being a balance of power in the world nah . it just wants to keep everyone else divided and at each other's throat so it can be the top dog . > because they simply don't care because they simply * can't * ____ i'm sorry buddy but you're just parroting propaganda ."
6722,"it's amazing how little british redditors learn about their and european history . the uk didn't care about europe because it was way easier to subjugate and plunder foreign colonies . they did care about balance of power in europe which failed spectacularly with the american and french revolution and later the german empire and third reich , ultimately costing the uk its global dominance and made the us ( and ussr/russia ) the only remaining superpower(s ). all eu countries understood that they can only be sovereign after wwii if they tightly coordinate their global interests . which results in the eu being an economic global powerhouse on par with or even larger than the us - just like britain was before its decline and the ascent of the us ( the first colony to free itself from the yoke of imperial britain ). the uk has a way too distorted self-image and relies on foreign adventures as a smokescreen for domestic political failures to be relied on ."
6723,"> uk on the other hand never really cared about large land campaigns you know the 100 year's war was a series of conflicts fought almost entirely in france between them and english dynasties , with the goal of being the largest western european power ? you're just wrong . it had massively to do with conquering ."
6724,the uk has been supporting ukraine since 2014 .
6725,"> part of it is to undermine the eu , the uk supporting the defense of the baltics is not something that undermines the eu . it is helpful to the eu . > their international standing after the aukus submarines story this was a good story from the uk's perspective , not a bad story ."
6726,"> other part is to refesh their international standing after the aukus submarines story , i mean , you know that anyone that's not france doesn't give a shit about that story right ? edit : hell , i'd imagine the people of france , uk , us and australia don't give a shit either . it's the machinations of geopolitical arms deals ."
6727,""" protecting far away nations "" lmao , probably even the english people are laughing at crap like that . uk is not doing this without a reason , they are masters of diplomacy and imperialism . nobody cares about far away nations , it is all about what involvement gets you . for now , ukraine being strong or russia being weak is an important part of their agenda , thus the support . this is how it works for governments ."
6728,"like czechoslovakia , and poland , and the netherlands , and belgium , and luxemburg , and denmark , and norway , and the dutch east indies , and british malaya , and greece , and yugoslavia and france . all protected by the might of the uk !"
6729,in what universe is the uk not a real global power ?
6730,"> for for them russian invasion of ukraine is a long term disaster , undermining the chances of eu playing as equal with us and china . this makes no sense . how does russia invading ukraine undermine the eu's chances of being a geopolitical equal of the us ?"
6731,> destabilise the eu . how does the uk supporting the baltics undermine the eu ?!
6732,> empty russian threat the attitude of western europe towards russia could not be better described .
6733,""" empty russian threat ""? you have been following the news the last 3 months i hope ?"
6734,would you mind not ignorantly conflating the united kingdom with anglo saxon ? thanks
6735,"you see , iraq war wasn't about freedom or people..it was about resources . uk has bp and a lot of weapons production . this and us help was enough to secure political decisions to join the invasion . imo it was a cruel example of corporation sponsored war .."
6736,"> yeah , russia wrecking ukraine and it could've been in my opinion avoided if only all parties actually worked on mutual solution and not shitface diplomacy "" all parties worked on mutual solution ""? what ? because of an expansionist dictator's imperialist delusions ? a "" mutual solution "" would be russia returning crimea in return of getting rid of sanctions perhaps , not the world's largest country grabbing more * lebensraum * every few years "" but less than ideally wanted if you appease us enough "". the fact that some russians still think their dictator's delusions were actually justified in any way or were supposed to be listened to only proves how it's the entire nation that's mentally deranged . it is impossible to peacefully co-exist with this nation ."
6737,"2 can play that game , it's not like nato doesn't have as many nukes as russia"
6738,thats just nonsense . if russia just wanted to start a nuclear war nothing stops them sending a missile onto a nato country right now . no amount of force in that country will prevent that
6739,"but their nukes are effectivly worthless because both side can deploy them you can threaten all you want , but even the kremlin isn't dumb enough to get russia incinerated by a nuclear exchange , so the territories will most likely be retaken conventionally"
6740,> conventional forces have to be able to repel the invasion . correct . but they dont need to be in the border country in the first place
6741,ofc but thats just not realistic . you cant station hundreds of thousands of soldiers in each bordercountry
6742,"there are also always some american soldiers in lithuania , and i imagine the us is waiting with glee for anything to happen to them ."
6743,"> dude , we meet 2 % gdp requirement and we are increasing our budget . and as a brit i am really grateful for my good lithuanian allies doing their bit for out collective security . i really appreciate it ."
6744,well why dont you guys simply just get a bigger gdp ? easy peasy
6745,we are already there .
6746,"> have zero interest in serving as cannon fodder in the baltics until uncle sam arrives ( if arrives ) if this is how europeans feel about their own security , americans should take note ."
6747,so you would rather serve as cannon fodder without the guarantee that uncle sam arrives ?
6748,what to they have in kaliningrad ?
6749,">> fear of provoking moscow - we shouldnt say that anymore . at this point moscow is provoking us and (?) we answer (?) [ that ] they should tread carefully , not us . we are the bear in the room , not russia . i think translated that correctly ;)"
6750,we're the care bears
6751,"lithuania is working on that , but building new infrastructure takes time . majority of new money approved this year ( additional 0.5 % gdp for military ) was assigned for these projects specifically - new training areas , new logistics infrastructure , new warehouses for ammunition . but it will take some time ( 2-3 years ) to complete"
6752,finland could also help .. ** if you would let us in **
6753,ive read comment from out def min and its definitely challenging to house more troops . that is why there is massive investment undergoing with a goal of housing thousands of additional troops throughout the country if necessary
6754,he's certainly not putin's buddy .. he's just trying to play both sides .
6755,turkey and russia is mortal enemies since forever . also it's more of the west fault for supporting a islamist since 2001 .
6756,no . your thinking is simplistic and wrong .
6757,"umm , i'm not sure that in this situation you can disregard the russia situation . this does seem to be a case of all of us needing each other . that's a strangely isolationist comment for someone in putin's crosshairs ."
6758,i'm talking about finland and sweden complaining about not being let into nato quick enough when they've had decades to apply for it .
6759,"i love how europeans use "" american "" as an insult in the same thread where you demand us to die for you . is there anything incorrect about his statement ? they chose neutrality ."
6760,while erdogan is an asshole he doesn't have a problem with finland . his only problem is with sweden and he is being irrational about it . finland gets splash damage .
6761,not committing to the dfense of anyone before being the one endangered . smart move . sad turkey does not agree .
6762,nice of you to turn up when the russians are threatening you now . not willing to put your nations on the line for anyone else but now demanding that everyone come to your aid and defend you .
6763,only if russia escalates it to the nuclear level . i doubt nato would do so . nato simply does not need nuclear weapons to beat russia . that might have been different during the cold war era but nowadays russia would not stand a chance against the usa . and even less against the us and the rest of nato .
6764,"well , yeah . that too :)"
6765,"glad that redditors have experience with nuclear missile building , are aware of the russian military , have experience fighting wars , done courses and also fought on the frontline while leading their own squad to win back lost territories in their countries ."
6766,thank you . it amazes me how many people forget this little factoid when expressing how very badass we all are .
6767,"with china still standing , finally being 1 ."
6768,i don't think we can be so secure that putin will not resort to nuclear power . a dying megalomaniac with a neurological disorder and a finger on a big button scares the s *** out of me . i wonder if nato isn't hoping he will die and someone rational who isn't on deaths door will stand up .
6769,"i doubt there would be a civilization ending nuclear war . although i do fear for the possibility of a full scale , conventional world war 3 ."
6770,"oh , they aren't second anymore ?"
6771,you do understand civilian resistance would prolly just end in mass graves like in ukraine
6772,"> that's what i would fear too . if it would have been "" totally illogical and foolish for russia "" back then to invade ukraine and still did so , even bombing civilians , then what sort of sanity can we expect from kremlin in the future ? the saving grace here is that from the looks of it the kremlin did so out of bad intel where putin horribly underestimated ukraine's capabilities . this shouldn't happen with nato as the kremlin is very well aware that in a nato-russia war that they'd get absolutely creamed ."
6773,"i think the point is , it's hard to completley stop a ground invasion with air power alone . the baltics are geographically so small that they don't have any strategic depth ( there's no room to fall back and regroup without leaving the baltics and retreating into central europe ). if you're a nato defense planner right now , your 1 priority is how to avoid the baltics becoming donetsk/luhansk -- once the enemy has a foothold there , it's not a guarantee that you'll be able to dislodge them . the traditional doctrine is "" we put a bunch of nato tripwires there , so if they try anything , you have dead americans and a direct confrontation between us/uk and russia "". but i think that plan of "" we only call in the cavalry if something goes wrong "" is being rethought now , because what it implies is that the baltic would have to be ceded and then retaken , and it's not a certainty that they'd be able to be retaken . so what you really want is never to have to retreat out of them at all . this is part of why nato has been trying to get sweden and finland to join since the 60s . it immediately makes 3 sides of the baltic sea nato territory as opposed to 1 , which helps with defending the baltics ."
6774,"have things changed that quickly ? i went to tallinn last year to see their christmas market and i didn't see or hear any other americans . lots of finnish and/or estonian ( i can't tell them apart when it's background noise ) and some russian when i had to go use a laundromat in lasname , but almost no english unless i was speaking to them in english to start with ."
6775,"americans where ? and like you said , the finns here are tourists , not soldiers ."
6776,not sure where youve been on base but at least here in germany we dont hold the us military bases in very high regard . yes they bring some money into the local town but thats really the only positive
6777,"once you start you have to keep proving it , that's how any primate pack leader keeps dominance . give some lower status guy that challenges you a good roughing up now and then ."

6790,say what now ?
6791,"you guy definitely get the short end of the stick whenever ww2 contributions get discussed . the us and the soviets tend to get the most glory , i guess because the uk had the "" unprestigious "" job of holding the line ( alone for a while ) until the cavallery arrived . on d-day there were more british than american troops , but alot of people think it was mostly the us . decades of hollywood movies changed the perception i guess ."

6798,"i have a bad habit of writing england for uk indeed , sorry my fellow auld alliance friend ."

6801,"em , that's blatantly false ."
6802,what did scholz say ?
6803,out of interest have you got a source for that . im interested in what she actually said
6804,more money is not contributing more so lets stop that fake news . we have a way better intelligence agency and have supported them for years you didnt . can anyone with a straight face say germany has done more for ukraine then us ? like come on .
6805,only on paper .
6806,"germany has sent less than half of what it's promised , military wise ."
6807,they've actually only committed in paper only . a lot of the equipment hasn't actually been delivered as its been stalled now by the government .

6811,true . we pick and choose which democratic movements we support . but if we do support you you know you have a true friend . it just takes a lot for the uk to count someone as a true friend .
6812,the us is rather strongly attached to the idea of defending democracy as well . doesn't mean we follow our values all the time .
6813,the one brit on this thread that doesn't just parrot nationalistic propaganda . thank you .
6814,yeah we only sacrificed everything to end the german and japanese empires and then fought a 45 year cold war to beat the soviets and protect and then expand democracy across europe . ( again ). but then again it is reddit discussing the uk . can't possibly have anything positive go unchallenged
6815,then you've been reading too many headlines . we don't need the eu to help european countries during a war
6816,"> or so you would think , judging by all the times the uk went to war in europe without the issue involving them . you mean all the times they went to war to stop some jumped up european power such as spain , france or what formed germany trying to conquer everyone else on the continent and consistently returning conquered land on the continent back to those liberated nations . > nah . it just wants to keep everyone else divided and at each other's throat so it can be the top dog . exactly what i said to maintain the power balance . not like the french who when they got more power just deciding to try and conquer everyone else around them . same with the spanish , and well the germans don't even need any introduction . spain , france and germany couldn't conquer europe either . why it took them millions of deaths and crimes against humanity like we've never seen to finally admit it is beyond me ."
6817,"me : britain never had major conquest aims in europe because they wanted to focus on colonial expansion and mercantilism unlike france and germany which always had european domination aims and sparked some of the biggest wars in history through their unrelenting desire to conquer all of europe . uk has always prioritised maintaining a balance of power and ensuring no power becomes too strong on the continent because they know the next target would be the uk mainland . you : "" hur history , uk no europe coz colonies ' literally exactly what i said lmao ? uk had interests elsewhere , they never cared about dominating or creating some british mass colonies on the continent like france and germany did.napoleonic wars and ww2 wouldn't have happened and millions upon millions would have been spared death and war if france and germany were not so obsessed with trying to conquer all of europe all the time but their egos always got the better of them . anytime they got a whif of power they simply used it to wage war on their neighbours . don't be mad because the uk always stood in the way of germany and france trying to conquer all of europe and was always a thorn in the side of germany and france trying to bully their influence in the eu ."
6818,"you know the 100 years war happened hundreds of years before the uk was a nation ? the hundred years war also wasn't england vs france . it was different royal families descended from france fighting for control of the french crown and had kingdoms and allies from both sides of the channel fighting on either side . the "" uk "" and "" france "" fought on both sides of the hundred years war ."
6819,the hundred years war had barely anything to do with the english in the first place . it was two french royal families fighting for the throne in paris . with one side using a mix of english and french troops and the other side just french troops .
6820,"yeah , looks like it helped a lot !"
6821,"still showed on the international level how little fucks australia and the us ( and to an other extent the uk ) give to their "" allies "". like learning that your gf is shagging someone else because she and the other bloke posted how they're getting engaged on facebook without even telling you she's breaking up with you ."
6822,"ukraine is also just self interested , not wanting to be ruled by russia . ukraine being strong and russia being weak is an important part of their agenda ."
6823,in the same sense that france or germany ( especially ) are not global powers individually . that was the whole point of eu in the first place . uk is currently getting screwed on their trade deals just because they lost eu power .
6824,to became a real superpower eu needed russia as stable energy/fuel source . but russia turned out to be nothing but stable
6825,agree . thank god for us and uk ...
6826,western europe in the nutshell : * the baltics and poland are russophobic !!!*
6827,they are waving empty threats at the russians is what i think he meant .
6828,i meant the uk and the us . why is it offensive ?
6829,"> you see , iraq war wasn't about freedom or people..it was about resources . this is what europeans will say about ukraine in 10 years . mindless conspiracy theory dominates your worldview . the us should have nothing to do with you . thank god the midterms are coming up and we can start the path to decoupling ."
6830,"sure but with how nervous a lot of countries have been about escalation do you think they would be willing to say "" yeah we will burn the world if it comes to it ""."
6831,"nato countries tend to have democratically elected leaders that actually have to worry about whether saying "" i'll blow up the fuckin world "" will go over well with their people . any nato leader making nuclear threats would likely find themselves out of office rather quickly , it's in no one's best interest to start a nuclear war ."
6832,"no it's not . it's one of the core concepts of nato standing . will they actually defend an eastern european nation ? will the "" we need energy , we need peace , why die for tallin "" sayers really follow up when estonia calls article 5 ? will they risk nukes in their gardens ? if at any point russia believes that a , they can smack a neighboring nato country and b the nato will not response when threatens with nukes to solidy the gains , they will commit to it . they either don't want a nuclear war , but if they believe they can gain land and make the nato back down , they will do it . and russia is not known for rational leadership . so a conventional force needs to be in place , so if at any time russia believes it could do it , it gets clapped in the field instantly no land is lost to them . that's also the easiest way of prevent nuclear war without sacrificing eastern nato members to russians ."
6833,"you would hope so , but until that is tested in practice we can only hope . what happens if an insane terminally-ill dictator like putin decides to call nato's bluff , drives hard overnight , captures a capital city and declares that is now russian territory and forces trying to take it back will be fired upon by tactical nuclear warheads ? would the world * really * react with a nuclear response at the entirety of russia if that happened ? really really ?"
6834,"well , that's the argument , isn't it . if half the country can be overran by the time the responding force gets on the front lines and then tries to hold the line for more substantial reinforcements , that's not gonna be great . like , our capital city is 20 km from border of belarus ( and forgive me for considering that an extension of russia for all intents and purposes ). the baltic countries are tiny . 200 km on well-maintained highways and you have most of the territory under your control . there isn't even an airforce worth mentioning to harass them , short of a couple allied jets on patrol ."
6835,"maybe , but us soldiers are dying all the time in their imperialism wars , nobody gives a fuck at home anymore . i guess a dead german soldier would be more a deal breaker , or any other european soldier ."
6836,"the us really doesn't want the distraction , they're gearing up to be ready to stop china ."
6837,"kaliningrad is home to the baltic fleet and a large amount of air power including nuclear capable missile systems(iskander ) that have the range to hit warsaw , berlin , copenhagen , stockholm etc . from kaliningrad . not sure how many land forces are there ."
6838,"i * think * this is most correct : > fear of provoking moscow - we shouldn't say that anymore . at this point moscow is provoking us , and (?) we can answer (?) that they should tread carefully , not us . we are the bear in the room , not russia ."
6839,i meant other people's money .
6840,"i dgaf really , personally i'm anti-nato , if it was up to me i'd have turkey leave it . take our place for all i care ."
6841,"yeah makes sense . the thing i'm not so sure about : for e.g . us troops it makes sense that their permanent bases also house their families on base due to distance from home . for european partners it wouldn't necessarily be required , just proper housing for all soldiers . but still the question is how expensive that housing would be - obviously keeping them at home and only shipping out in times of need is cheaper which is why theure going for it right now ."
6842,at the moment it looks like he's closer to putin ( no sanctions either ). i agree that he's always tried to play games ( e.g . pretending to oppose israel and defend palestine then he's working with the israelis again and it goes on ).
6843,he's president of turkey . he's big enough not to have to play sides .
6844,that was relating to why finland hasnt applied before and the disregarding part was us being in immediate danger when asshats like erdogan start playing . now we have time because of ukraine
6845,only complaints are about erdogan playing games that have nothing to do with us . few years ago if we applied and erdogan started playing russia would have had soldiers ready
6846,"only time article 5 was used , it was others dying for the us ."
6847,turkey is demonstrating quite clearly why sweden and finland were reluctant to join nato i.e binding one self to the protection of authoritarian nut jobs like erdogan should turkey be attacked . but needs must i suppose .
6848,the largest reasons why finland hadn't applied before was because the population was afraid russia would attack us if we did and because it would hurt economic ties with russia . now both of those are less relevant . russia is busy in ukraine and won't have the power to wage two wars at once and we're separating our economic ties from russia anyway because of sanctions .
6849,"lol . we've been the eastern defence of nato for decades , what changes now is we get to take part in the decision making when we are finally approved . still pretty much handle our own defence ."
6850,"nato definitely ( i'd like to think ) has planned for ways to defend countries like the baltic states with minimal escalation and without threatening major russian cities directly . nato is so vastly superior to russia with conventional weapons they could win with minimal to no strikes on russian territory at all , the air superiority would be incredible , if you think ukrainians with some bayraktars wreak havoc on russian forces , wait until the us pounds their shit with b2s"
6851,"you are right , of course , but i think the danger of russia escalating in such a scenario is real , precisely because russia could never hope to win with conventional means ( not that there's really any "" winning "" in a nuclear war ). however for that same reason , i also don't believe that russia would ever actually attack a nato country in the first place , despite their sabre rattling . it's one of the reasons why the were so opposed to ukraine joining nato : it would effectively eliminate the possibility for any future military aggression against ukraine ."
6852,"since there is absolutely no question left about what would happen if russia and nato fight a conventional war , i'm afraid that ** if ** russia attacks nato , then it's going to be the whole deal , tactical nukes included ."
6853,it's a social media discussion forum . what exactly did you expect to be here ?
6854,"if nuclear war breaks out , all of the major powers will be bombed whether they were initially involved or not ( precisely to avoid the scenario you described )."
6855,"post ussr document releases showed that they had plans to nuke neighbors , neutral developed countries and anyone who might try one up them while they rebuild from nuclear disaster . if they couldnt be on top no one could . russia will probably do the same ."
6856,"putin can give the order to nuke everything ( i consider it near impossible he actually does ), but after that it is also not certain the order will be followed . it is not an automatic process ."
6857,"once people consider the great powers sufficiently occupied , tons of regional wars are going to break out to create facts on the ground before the giants can spare some attention to what happens there again ."
6858,[ this says 4th ]( 1 . us air force 2 . us army 3 . russia 4 . us navy
6859,yes . in 1940 our people thought that . if we dont rebel againt russians they wont do anything . they did anyway . killed and exiled people . ir really dont matter with russian if you fight them or not they still gonna kill just because they want to resttle these land with they people . so fighting bavk just gives satisfation what you did not let them take you without a fight
6860,"i've been on base here in germany , and am now an adult german american dual citizen living in germany as a civilian . many germans today don't hold the us in very high regard in general but if you look back at the 80s and 90s most germans were happy to have bases nearby , bars and restaurants thrived , there were a lot of us dual citizens born . no , it wasn't necessarily positive everywhere , just as much as it wasn't negative everywhere . ex girlfriend of mine from bavaria used to tell me about the extremely noticeable and negative difference when the base in some town she went to school in as a child got shut down , from crime uptick to less local economy . got a lot of family and older friends who viewed the american bases as positive as well . idk anecdotal i guess , i've never looked at the numbers of economic impact . i'm sure someone here looking for a reason to shit on america can find the data , though :)"
6861,> not sure where youve been on base but at least here in germany we dont hold the us military bases in very high regard . is that why you freaked out when trump wanted to move them to poland ? hopefully all us troops will be home in a a few years .
6862,"same in america . i used to live in town surrounding fort bragg and the military guys were notorious for being scary and violent . i had a huge 18th birthday party and the only damage that was done was by fort bragg soldiers but they literally broke tables , ruined carpets , and stalked girls . i gave one girl my bedroom because a soldier was so weird about her and we wanted to protect her from him . when we woke up the next day he was sleeping under the bed . so weird ."
6863,"again , not true . no one seriously doubts us as the sole superpower in the world although you do have smaller actors who undoubtedly engage in aggression towards the us . saddam for instance tried to be the tail that wagged the dog and ended up getting dug out of a hole to be hung . gaddafi . putin and xi look to be next ."
6864,what about the [ war of jenkins ' ear ?](
6865,"they have had 2,5 of those countries already ."
6866,the uk is most definitely one of the most influential nations on the planet . thinking otherwise is foolish .
6867,ah yes . london definitely isnt relevant...ok
6868,i think churchill is one of those people whod have been a fairly poor peacetime leader but exactly the right man to lead a total war effort . then again he did support a land value tax early in his career despite being a massive aristocrat .
6869,""" some chicken - some neck !"""
6870,"> i don't even think that's true . i saw some docu the other day that the intention wasn't to appease but to prepare britain for war . it was both . a big part of the generation fought in ww1 and didn't want a repeat , but as parliament was split they did ramp up all defence spending too ."
6871,"that's really not true . was it that docudrama about the munich agreement ? the most positive thing i will say about neville was that he kicked the raf into shape , they had this odd orthodoxy that fighters were not relevant . it is also worth pointing out that most people were pro appeasement and against armament . this covers that little bit of history nicely :"
6872,"degaulle was ... unique . he also [ pushed for a proposal to unite france and the uk into one country ]( as a reaction to the imminent defeat of france to the german blitzkrieg . one of the great "" what if?""s of 20th century history ."
6873,"can you source the sentences you quoted in your comment ? as for de gaulle , he went in normandy on the 10/11 june 1945 instead of the 6 because he was mad that he wasnt informed about d day until 2 days before it happened and because the us soldiers came with their own new francs printed in the us that he saw as an attack on the independence of france ."
6874,no they fucking don't stop lying . regardless of what dr gaulle said .
6875,is this actually true ? are you french out of interest ?
6876,"hah , usurious sorry ."
6877,"lots of commonwealth troops too , gave their lives to rid evil half way round the world from them , heroes ."
6878,"not europe , britain . the loans that followed were far more favourable for the aggressors than the uk . then it took the understanding of the fall out of suez before the usa realised that it's anti british views were actually self defeating ."
6879,i'm not questioning why people didn't want war . but the idea that chamberlain wanted to delay war for rearmourment doesn't exactly act out in his actions or lack there of .
6880,boris johnson knows nothing about foreign relations and diplomacy and the brexit negotiation showed that . the idiot he put as foreign minister couldn't even tell where the baltics are . it's a disaster and it's so embarrassing for this great country to be represented by incompetent lunatics .
6881,the uks history of being the bullies
6882,"so much text and hardly ( if ) anything at all about ee . yes , france is a global power that still acts in it's former colonies because of treaties . yay ? don't give a fuck here , tbh . uk is seen as better ally - because it is . there have been international scandals , if you can call them that , how france almost sold mistral aircraft carriers to russia ( only stopped because of crimea ), how france basically sold out georgia to russia , how germany built nordstreams . these are seen as allies selling out to ee's enemy in russia . so fuck off with your "" english news are seen more "" - uk was and still is a better ally . i'd much rather france would've left eu than uk . and how much western countries ( read fr-de ) opposed deploying troops in ee . it only took some wars to shift some gears . but even then , just a fucking week ago scholz came and lied to our faces about deploying more troops ( changed stance just few days after that lie ). fuck em ."
6883,"ok cool , doesn't change the fact that the britishers gave the ukrainians weapons while the french were talking . pointing out that macron has stupid russia policy ( man spent years going on about how he can turn russia into a european partner ) is not russian propaganda meant to divide nato , macron until very recently called nato braindead because he didn't understand russia"
6884,"> those french troops are stationed in an american base near constanta ( mk ) that has had a uk/canadian/us presence for over 8 years , including fighter jets and warship visits for the air defence of romania . everyone has had "" a presence "" for years in eastern countries as part of nato's efp . the us often led troops in romania and various nato countries have rotated in the past , including france , with the warship patrols in the black sea and the air policing you're talking about . france took the lead there this year . by the way , italy and britain are the two countries helping with air policing in romania right now , just like france is doing in poland currently despite those countries not belonging to the nato battlegroups in romania and poland respectively . so i don't understand what you thought i meant by comment haha . that the current french deployment was something special ?! nato states have been doing such tasks for years ... well before the war in ukraine . i never claimed it was a big deal . that wasn't my point . the building of the 3 bases , the intensification of means ( it is notably the first time ever that the samp/t mamba abm system is being deployed outside of france itself . i don't think we've got anything similar in estonia for example ) and the increase of forces , all of those to be permanently stationed in romania does actually show a high level of commitment . > likewise the uk's battlegroup in estonia has been there for almost a decade already ( although recently increased in scope ). it's not just ' more media attention '. the uk-led ( operation cabrit ) battlegroup in estonia is there since 2017 yes . the french contingent ( operation lynx ) in the baltics belong to this one . it was deployed there in 2017 and has been based there since then just like the uk ( beyond the switch to lithuania for the year 2018 before being back in 2019 ). > france frances battlegroup deployment to romania is no different in scale or permeance to any of the other 7 leading nations battlegroups . exactly .... you just touched the matter at hand . you're just making my ( and fctrl's ) point here about the idea of other western european nations not being involved compared to the uk being more involved being a matter of greater coverage , no ?! > your article is unfortunately paywalled . but if these are actually covered by some outlets , then good . it means it is simply a matter of people wanting to push narratives regardless of facts ."
6885,did i need the / s ? or ' oh wait ...'
6886,[ here ]( is the press conference where she said it . but its in german :-/
6887,"oh moving the goal posts now , are we ?"
6888,how many refugees did the uk take compared to germany ?
6889,lmao what does that even mean
6890,[ germany is the 2nd biggest supporter behind the us ]( and this only includes aid from the start of the war . if you look at aid since 2014 germany is miles ahead of the rest ( except the us i think ?)

6894,> the us is rather strongly attached to the idea of defending democracy as well . except when it's left leaning or has the potential to hurt us conglomerates ... in which case you drop hundreds of kilotons of democracy on those places .
6895,"you can easily say something positive about the uk that i won't challenge : "" it's good the uk is supporting ukraine "". there , easy . edit : more succinctly put , you can say we're doing something right without having to make out we're saints ."
6896,"> don't be mad because the uk always stood in the way of germany and france trying to conquer all of europe and was always a thorn in the side of germany and france trying to bully their influence in the eu . french and german ambitions to dominate europe ultimately ended both in russian winter . britain was relevant , but not decisive . the uk ceased to be a major continental european ( though european ) power with the end of the 100-years-war . similarly , the uk is a welcomed addition in the current conflict with russia , but rather an ' also-ran ' compared to continental europe ( including eu and ukraine ) or the us . not that you would get this picture in most uk publications . the eu neither has nor ever had a center of power in any nation state . the uk never thwarted any ' ambitions ' of either france or germany within the eu when these countries had sufficient support from other eu countries - often times with each other - just as the eu was designed to work . it's fascinating that apparently the functioning of european politics and/or eu politics is still such an enigma in the uk . maybe you should read more in french for a change ."
6897,"> the hundred years war also wasn't england vs france . it was different royal families descended from france fighting for control of the french crown and had kingdoms and allies from both sides of the channel fighting on either side . this described all wars at the time . nevertheless , there was an official king of france , as there was of england , which makes it a conflict of nations as much as it is between claims to the throne from different dynasties ( at least it became this ). > the "" uk "" and "" france "" fought on both sides of the hundred years war . sure , but at this time there was a definitive distinction between the monarchies from both modern day nations . the results of these wars was a more unified french identity , despite the fickle allegiances from lords and dukes and whatnot . if you want to draw the line at the creation of the 1st republic then just say so ."
6898,"i'm aware the english royal family had origins at the time from the french one . but there was a very real divide between the english and french at this time nevertheless , and the outcome of the wars cemented this . at what point does a royal family across two nations stop being "" the same "" family fighting ? how many generations does it need to be ?"
6899,it's not like france is any better lol . arms deals have always been like that . france had people working on trouble shooting exocets when they were being launched at british ships during the falklands . they were also going to sell russia amphibious assault ships until 2014 happened .
6900,"> little fucks australia and the us ( and to an other extent the uk ) give to their "" allies "". like france then towards the uk or australia ? more than happy to back italy stealing australia destined vaccines . france more than happy to try decimate the financial sector in the uk for their own gain . all that's fine and totally not bad to do to allies"
6901,"oh my god , how are you still salty about that"
6902,"> still showed on the international level how little fucks australia and the us ( and to an other extent the uk ) give to their "" allies "". since when was france an ally to anyone ? you armed russia , you're arming china ."
6903,"right but the uk is still a global power , albeit diminished economically . its still one of a small minority of countries with a global power projection capability , for one thing . its definitely not a superpower , but it is 100 % a global power ."
6904,"russia was never going to be stable though . i mean , russia annexed crimea , what , 7 + years ago ? invading ukraine did not change the calculation in a meaningful way ( in terms of the eu being able to depend upon russia )."
6905,russia have been invading countries for decades....yet the larger countries in europe decided it's still fine to put all the eggs in the russia basket and make themselves dependent on russia .
6906,"how though - i mean , since the fall of crimea the uk was in the country training ukrainian troops and helping them , before russia invaded the uk sent thousands of anti-tank weapons and publicly called russia with evidence that they was going to attack . how is the uk waving empty threats when its one of the few european countries to consistently support ukraine since 2014 ."
6907,which makes no sense given all the active opposition to russia the uk is currently putting up with .
6908,"without getting into a long diatribe : anglo saxon is the name of a specific ethnic group that has nothing to do with the terms british , american or even anglophone . to use it as an alternative reference to the uk is a sweeping generalisation that ignores many other different ethnic groups , for example scotland is not anglo saxon , not even england could be referred to entirely as anglo saxon . just stick with british , its usually the most correct term . edit : apologies if my earlier response was a bit blunt . as a non english british person , it gets pretty tiring seeing ( what is to me ) obviously incorrect terms being used to refer to us , but appreciate it can be confusing for the rest of the world ."
6909,you're too much into europe bashing . this is fucking reddit . the main american subreddits like / r/politics are far more anti-american than / r/europe ( and it is stupid in both of these ).
6910,and yet you dont need massive troops in border states to threaten a response you might wanna start living in the 20th century and not in the past
6911,if the west doesn't react the precedent set is even worse then a limited exchange not only would that destroy any trust in nato but also in the eu and the west as a whole anyone with nukes would have free reign to invade anything

6919,"turkey has helped ukraine since the war and they have the bosphorus and dardenelles straits closed since march which blocks paths for russian warships . turkey may be causing tantrums , but they'd never want to make a disastrous move of making nato their enemy ."
6920,"that is a useful tidbit of info , but especially in this context it's not appropriate . america spent huge amounts of blood and treasure to make sure ( western ) europe remains free . the cold war was a harsh thing and these 100 thousand young americans in germany knowing they'll have an expected 10 minutes to live is something very significant ."

6924,hardcore war academics and generals ofcourse
6925,"only if russia or nato are involved . if it was india v china , they couldn't afford to diversify their targets for a nuclear strike ."
6926,"that * really * depends on the circumstances of the war and the amount of nuclear launches . but even if that ends up being true , yes 10s of millions of chinese would be killed unprovoked , but china would still probably walk out of it relatively unscathed compared to russia and nato . in a nuclear war the priority of every nuclear participant is to take out as many enemy nuclear silos as they can before all the payloads are launched , so the us and russia would be disproportionally targeted"

6945,he's talking about military aid . germany has committed a substantial amount but not delivered very much .
6946,it means you havent been following too closely or you wouldnt spout this bullshit . germany has repeatedly been under the radar because they promised ( or pledged :) ) a lot but in fact they havent delivered anywhere close to it . ukraine has also come out and said it a lot of times already .

6975,"it wasn't the largest supplier of arms , this is cope from people who can't read and think that the value of licenses is the same as equipment delivered , the poles delivered 129 million euros worth of equipment compared to the french who delivered 27 million . nato was never braindead to anyone who understood that russia was still a threat , how french national security experts have convinced themselves that they could have turned russia into an ally that would help them stand up to both china and the us should be a source of soul searching but it is instead a source of cope about how the french totally didn't get caught flat footed . everyone with half a brain understood that russia was a bad actor in 2019"
6976,is it working ? do you understand acab with autotranslate ? that would be very cool .
6977,seen by who ? the anglosphere media ? lmao
6978,"this doesnt take into account the ring exchange between germany and eastern european countries though . also it makes sense because the equipment germany can send needs extensive training before it will be useful to ukraine . e.g . the promised howitzers have arrived this week , after the ukrainian soldiers finished their training in germany . disregarding all this , why should humanitarian aid be excluded from this ? germany is hosting almost a million refugees ( meanwhile the uk is deporting them to rwanda ) and send billions in non military supplies which are just as important . but i guess reddit just desperately needs to keep their germany bad narrative alive"
6979,"yeah this is just not true mate , the reports on this have been debunked a thousand times already"
6980,thats literally the case for every country on this list though and germany hasnt send anything since march is just not true . also it doesnt take into account that germany is hosting almost a million refugees and the ring exchange between germany and eastern european countries
6981,"the house of plantagenet was an english royal house from the year 1154 with king henry ii . the war begin in 1337 with king edward iii contesting the french throne . that is 183 years later and a whole bunch of kings . i think you could say the conquest was quite far back by then , and they had their own identity ."
6982,i'd say the counterpoint to iraq is the suez crisis .
6983,"chechnya , georgia , and alexander litvinenko might have different opinions about how friendly russia and putin were in the early 2000s . russia has not been friendly for over a century . it has certainly been a thug state ever since putin got his hooks in . it is fantasy to pretend we didn't all know it ."
6984,"what is this absolute nonsense - risk averse ? the uk currently the only country besides the united states that actually flies its intelligence planes in international waters off the cost of ukraine because its where they can soak up the most intelligence despite them being vulnerable , every other country that has their own intelligence platforms limits their intelligence capability to eu airspace , that alone seems the opposite of risk averse . if the uk is risk averse then what exactly is the rest of europe because the fact is that the uk is more willing to support and arm other countries more than any other european nation . im not sure why youve just decided to shit on the uk by just denying history and facts , but if you did a little research youd know that the uk is heavily involved in european security and if youre looking for risk averse nations there are plenty in europe but the uk isnt one of them ."
6985,"dumbest comment on reddit today ? i suppose we went into sierra leone , kosovo , iraq , afghanistan or retook the falklands because it was a good jolly . i have to laugh at this sub sometimes , second most active military in the world and we are risk averse , christ mate ."
6986,how is visas for ukranians related to threats to russia ? if you made the comparasion with germany that keeps finding excuses to not send weapons i'd understand but the uk is providing a lot on that front .
6987,"thank you , appreciate it !"
6988,history disagrees with you \\\_()_/ 
6989,an attack on a nato state triggers article 5 but i am sure you already know that and just want to hate for the sake of hating
6990,in such a case you arent starting a war with most if not all your territory lost though since its not you that is fighting but nato .
6991,yea i dont even know why we should help them
6992,are you even serious ? he literally is using the word * american * as an insult . you're a regular in an anti-american hate sub . have some self-awareness .
6993,"i see you still have a very warped americanized vision of german politics . > facilitated by america yeah no , germany had about 1.5 million active soldierd during the 1980s . after the fall of the ussr that decreased gradually because there just wasnt any real threat . but the pacifist attitude was present since the end of ww2 . > pacifists have problems with americans can you blame them ? the us is bombing and murdering civlians from the air base in ramstein so that makes germany complicit in war crimes . not to mention the unjustified iraq war and tons of other interventions of the us in other countries which were not received well over here . > ossies have problems with americans from my experience they just fall into the pacifist category , no one wants the ddr back as the good old days . > oh wow go figure , this one inspired the pacifists! from your sarcasm you seem to disapprove of people criticizing the us killing over a million iraqi for no reason other than oil control ? average american lol > dismantling the bundeswehr which is stupid as fuck arguably true but theres a difference between dismantling and just decreasing the size of the bundeswehr > where you from nrw > not everyone is pro american , not everyone is anti true , but [ most people are anti nowadays ]( > fucking pray american troops are still here if putin decides he wants back his old kgb school in dresden , since its their presence the few thousands us troops wouldnt make a difference , if putin would attack eu and nato countries are all required to help defend the attacked country . no to mention , germany would never be the first target because its in the middle of europe so there would be enough time to ramp up the military since a conflict like that would last years but yeah mate you seem to have a lot of hostility towards germany , doesnt seem like the cultural exchange you praised had any effect on you . still with them exact same rhetoric i see from the average fox news viewers"
6994,please enlighten me then lol
6995,i mean yes . what other nation punished their own citizens that went to fight evil ?
6996,"we had gas chambers in ireland , til ."
6997,the uk having a base on cyprus was the only thing stopping turkey from taking the whole island in the 70s : > the turkish advance halted when it reached the edge of the dhekelia sovereign base area to avoid military conflict with the united kingdom .
6998,"> and i'm not interested in disseminating your comment because i have nothing constructive to say or sources to back up my words . ftfy . > you didn't wave the white flag as per usual and you show again that you are not constructive and uneducated , as you don't seems to know that france "" is the most successful military power in history ."" niall ferguson , british historian ."
6999,"bigger means largest ? you said ? > from people who can't read hum ? funny . yes , it's so stupid not to want to push russia into china's arms ."
7000,"[ the ukrainians themselves ?]( this may be reported by a uk newspaper , but keep in mind that it's the independent , which generally expresses the same low opinion of britain that you seem to cling to ."
7001,i was only pointing out the type of aid he was referencing .
7002,"the only one that publicises it . the eu nations are more discreet in their action . for example the french never said they'd send artillery , people only learned about it after it had been delivered ( and it's not crap , it's their best artillery system ). it's also a team effort . if x does this , y does that and z does thing . if the us and uk are already doing recon , why waste ressources ?"
7003,i was making a parallel between their ability to be great in communication while not necessarily doing what they say they would do .
7004,history does not disagree with him . in 1985 west-germany had almost half a million active soldiers with another ~ 800.000 reservists . why did it have such a large number of forces ? because the iron curtain ran straight through the country .
7005,"paper will accept everything but i bet after such action many countries would want to avoid war by saying "" do you want a nuclear war ?"" so such divisions in the baltic states are needed"
7006,"a drone fell in the zagreb , a capital of a nato country , that drone was launched by either ukraine or russia , but the incident was memory holed because it would trigger article 5 ."
7007,"indeed . i feel that's why the discussions are ongoing about this , though . the border countries do not really want to end up in that situation and i feel that's a pretty legit concern . of course , i might be slightly biased , seeing as russian apcs would be parked on my lawn in such an event . you know ."
7008,"anti-american hate sub ? you mean / r/shitamericanssay ? you're making my point very well , if that is what you think about that one ."
7009,">> yeah no , germany had about 1.5 million active soldierd during the 1980s . after the fall of the ussr that decreased gradually because there just wasnt any real threat . but the pacifist attitude was present since the end of ww2 . yeah no lol 4 + 2 vertrag , read up >> can you blame them ? the us is bombing and murdering civlians from the air base in ramstein so that makes germany complicit in war crimes . not to mention the unjustified iraq war and tons of other interventions of the us in other countries which were not received well over here no , i can't blame them - i outright admitted the us played their own part since the early 2000s . one of the * few * problems that i have with modern germans is that there is this ultra pacifist mindset , the polar opposite of the fascists that preceded us . it's good to have moved away from that but this * ultra * pacifism mentality is an issue . you see it in every bus , at every bahnhof , in the parking lots , at parties and clubs - these people carry a "" not my problem "" attitude , from women harassed in public to babies left alone in cars . it's good to be rid of fascists but the pendular swing has led to the broad death of civil courage and even standing up for what's right ( although they're very capable if it's a social gathering with picket signs about something far away - makes it seem more like cowardice than anything else ). >> from my experience they just fall into the pacifist category , no one wants the ddr back as the good old days . then your experience is limited , but at least you're acknowledging it's anecdotal rather than speaking for all of germany . given that the east is where the most neo nazis congregate it's kind of hard to say they're also a bunch of pacifists , something draws them there . if anything the general art und weise of people out east have seemed more assertive to me , personally , but for obvious reasons had much more russian than american influence in the last 70 or so years . the money > weapons idealogy doesn't seem as strong in the east . >> from your sarcasm you seem to disapprove of people criticizing the us killing over a million iraqi for no reason other than oil control ? average american lol no , not at all , i think iraq was a tremendous misstep , i'm just pointing out that it's not hard to play connect the dots with this portion of the population . as i said , america has played its own part . they certainly don't deserve the degree of enmity they get today , though , and the ultra pacifists are very black and white thinkers , there's no acknowledging the good and the bad with the majority of them . >> arguably true but theres a difference between dismantling and just decreasing the size of the bundeswehr given the status of the bundeswehr in recent years decreasing its size is functionally dismantling . not to mention i've heard from more than a couple people that they would like it dismantled , or is "" komplett abbauen "" ambiguous to you ? to me it was clear . i do live in an extremely liberal university city , and cannot say i've heard this sentiment elsewhere . >> true , but most people are anti nowadays scroll up , i said germans in general have a problem with americans nowadays . the sentiment grew exponentially in the last 20 years , again with the advent of putin and america's involvement in the middle east . >> nrw i'm only familiar with kln and dortmund personally , in terms of spending any time there ; beautiful area . meantime in guessing you're a pacifist rather than an ossie ;) >> the few thousands us troops wouldnt make a difference , if putin would attack eu and nato countries are all required to help defend the attacked country . no to mention , germany would never be the first target because its in the middle of europe so there would be enough time to ramp up the military since a conflict like that would last years 35k troops in germany , about the same number ukraine started this mess off with but heavily armed and hosting an arsenal of heavy weaponry , more than 1/10 of the current bundeswehr combat readiness - it would make a difference . i agree germany would be a strategically impossible first target according to current geopolitical borders , but it just takes one wrong leader in a neighbor country to change that . personally i'm very thankful poland has such long standing animosity toward russia . not to mention one has to ask how peaceful europe in general would be if america weren't involved and there were fat , wealthy countries not spending on their militaries , a nonstarter since in that situation * those countries would necessarily spend on their militaries * and the comfy anti military stance we have now wouldn't exist . >> but yeah mate you seem to have a lot of hostility towards germany , doesnt seem like the cultural exchange you praised had any effect on you . still with them exact same rhetoric i see from the average fox news viewers oh no no friend , it's not towards germany , just towards you . i was acknowledging the two sides of the coin until you started getting hostile towards americans in comments above . there are ( very few ) aspects of modern german culture that i dislike , actually i've identified most them in this very comment . overall i love germany , but think some pride and patriotism , within reason , would be appropriate , and as far as i can tell there are a lot of germans , of all colors and backgrounds , even here in my little super liberal city , that feel the same way . no one wants to see red , white , and black flags flying , but it seems most of us are tired for being accused of such when we want to see a black , red , and gold , and there's a trickle down , shame based mentality that belongs to this same line of thought that leads to this ultra pacifism . as to fox news , i dunno , i haven't seen it since probably 2010 or so . seems like you're extrapolating to put me into a little box to show how not german i am because you don't like that i represent an opinion different from yours from right here within your country and so you want to invalidate it , but at the same rate i'm not throwing anything at you that i haven't * at least personally * found consensus with among germans raised here for their whole lives . und zwar wenn du dich nur mit einem anderen deutschen unterhalten wrdest , der die gleiche meinung wie ich hat , httest du eine andere begrndung , warum deine meinung die einzig mgliche ist . es als "" amerikanisch "" abzutun ist halt faul . you can hate on america and americans if you want , but at least try not to be so polarized about it :)"
7010,shall we start to compare how many poles died under german occupation and how many irish died under english ? be my guest
7011,"the turkish invasion was a response to the actions of the eoka movement and this movement again arose in response to british oppression . it's a very complicated story but british imperialism played a big part in it . don't get me wrong , i am not trying to say they are the only party responsible for the mess there , but quite clearly british imperialism is one of the reasons the whole story happened . on a sidenote i was in akrotiri this january and seen wild flamingos , awesome view ."
7012,"i don't care about grandpas and how they were successful in their 20s . present day uk is an ee ally . and france is a phony . as has ** always ** been the case . even after all this you still couldn't say why ee should be trusting france more lmao . just pretending that your ego is the reason why we should . oh yeah , sorry that mali campaign was probably in ee , right ? lmao ."
7013,"licenses are different from arms deliveries , france is behind on deliveries . russia is a petrol station with nukes who cares if they align with china , they become less and less relevant each year so why enable them in europe because you're afraid that they'll support china"
7014,"where does this say that ukrainians think that the uk has done more than anyone else in europe ? and even then , what kind of bullshit metric is that , instead of just using objectively quantifiable values ? lmao"
7015,"weve seen absolutely hundreds of articles in this subreddit alone from every european country admitting in some way or commenting in some way on the large shipments that they have sent to ukraine , so what you just said was once again a load of nonsense , youre making shit up to justify your targeting of the uk and because there is absolutely no evidence that supports you argument . it is a team effort , but youre the one acting as if the uk is risk averse to the situation when if you actually take any time to review the situation the uk is the one alongside the united states that is actually placing some of its assets into areas where they could be shot down because they arent sticking to european union airspace ."
7016,"you made a comparison by ignoring facts - you've repeatedly said we haven't done what we said we would - yet we said we'd support ukraine and we've trained 22,000 of their troops since 2014 , sent so much weaponry that only poland and the united states are ahead of us . this isn't cheap weaponry either , we've sent some of our most advanced and classified systems to ukraine , most of which we only knew after videos emerged from ukrainians actually using them . your entire argument is based on purposely ignoring facts and it's somewhat telling that when called out in this you simply stop responding ."
7017,not forget ten thousands americans and brits . i think he confused 21th century and 20th century . but cold war is back and so is it's logics .
7018,"also article 5 can spread from declaration of war to strongly worded support letters . hell other nato members even could vote that article 5 does not apply and gone is estonia . it's just paper that has never been tested . in the end human leaders decide , not paper . article 5 is not an automation . attacked country has to call it , other nato members.vote if that's the case and then decide how to support the caller of article 5 ."
7019,not every accident triggers article 5 . please inform yourself
7020,"> the border countries do not really want to end up in that situation and i feel that's a pretty legit concern it indeed is . but there is no way to change that but remove that "" border "" part the outer territories of whatever will always be the first one to be hit"
7021,i really appreciate that you put that amount of detail into your comment so i didn't have to . although i fear for the person you're replying to this is a wasted effort .
7022,+ 1 on appreciation for writing that out . not the twat youre responding to but it was an interested read nevertheless .
7023,"still the us military is usually fairly isolated from the actual locals . how many soldiers end up being able to speak german after years of being stationed here ? > they dont make some money , they make a lot of money this only applies on a local scale , in the last 10 years the us bases in germany have cost us over a billion > is literally an oxymoron in the us military you realise i just quoted the guy i was responding to ? besides , you do read tons of reports of american soldiers behaving like shit because the locals should be grateful for them being there anyway bla bla"
7024,">> a bunch of young guys with no responsibility and money is literally an oxymoron in the us military . for clarity , they make good money when stationed overseas and many are young and unmarried\no children ( no responsibility ) looking to party and spend on the local economy . they give something like 40 % of their income to germany . i'm not talking about professional responsibility , should have been more clear about that ."

7029,"yes . soooo ... maybe we should give it more thought than "" ay , we'll ship some soldiers when shit goes down ... within a day or two ""."
7030,currently russia is definitely a threat to finland .
7031,yeah and finland not joining is a threat to finland .
7032,just like my neighbour's burglar alarm system is a threat to me .
7033,sorry but how idiotic do you have to be to not realize that invading your neighbour would lead to other neighbours joining nato .
7034,"good fuck you putin , russia is a threat to the entire world ."
7035,how . that is what i would like to know . how is finland joining nato a threat to russia exactly ?
7036,good . if a defensive pact is a threat to your imperialistic intentions then this is the right thing to do . you should feel threatened if your plan is fucking genocide .
7037,"our president said it well , russia brought this on themselves . they only need to look in the mirror to see why this is happening ."
7038,kremlin is again full of bullshit and they are doing their reversetalk . russia is a threat to finland and that is why finland is joining nato .
7039,"kremlin , the biggest threat to all of humanity , should probably shut the fuck up ."
7040,"how exactly is this a threat ? is there some piece of russian land finland is eyeing up ? even though there is land they lost during wwii to russia , they're not pursuing that . the threats here are only one way , though strangely russia sees an inability to invade as a threat ."
7041,fucking cringe . we do what we want as an independent nation . the only threat this poses to russia is to limit its imperialistic and genocidal possibilities . fuck russia . glory to ukraine . glory to the heroes .
7042,"only a bully sees other securing their defense as threat . that's the issue with russian thinking . only when something is totally subjugated under russiam then it stops being a threat . they think of themselves as better than anyone else , so naturally they don't seem the hypocrisy of that ."
7043,and russia is a threat to the entire world .
7044,finland didn't really care about nato until russia gave them a reason to care . russia has nobody except themselves to blame for this . its almost unreal how incompetent and self destructive russia's government is . by treating everyone around them as a threat they create threats where none exist .
7045,"russia : "" heeey ! you can't align with them by choice ! we wanted you to align with us by force ! no fair !"""
7046,putin is the biggest threat to russia
7047,"well when russia realizes putin is the biggest threat to russia and does something about that , i will care about the opinions of russia ."
7048,yeah russia is a threat to the world .
7049,how exactly is a defensive agreement a threat to anyone except a potential invader ?
7050,its a threat to us! why? because then we cant attack them! 
7051,"so what,is russia going to invade finland ??? lol , and do what ? get the breaks beat off them by the finsagain"
7052,russia is the only real threat to russia .
7053,russian trolls on twitter are working extra hard for their beet and potato rations today .
7054,he's right . finland is a threat to russian imperialism and finland's got plenty of friends . throughout the whole cold war you bullied finland to say nothing bad about your evil empire . they won't play that game during cold war ii .
7055,"in flemish , we have a saying : "" het zijn uw eigen luizen die bijten "", aka "" it's your own lice biting you "". roughly translates to you made your bed , now lie in it ."
7056,a fart in the wind is a threat to russia .
7057,remember when ukraine didn't join nato ? how did that work out ?
7058,"it's a threat to russia's plans of fuckery he meant . so finland and sweden are in the club , they won't hurt you if you don't hurt them . did you want to say something ? like just the tip ? welcome to the club guys ."
7059,"why ??? is nato planning to take over russia . nato is a defensive insurance policy and requires all nations agree to actions it takes . nato is not a single identity out to take over nations . russia's fake and over dramatic statement that it feels threatened , they need to explain exactly what it feels will happen . russia , ask yourself , why are countries choosing to voluntarily join nato and not join in with an alliance with russia . why ?"
7060,its time to make russia pay for its invasion of ukraine by surrendering kaliningrad .
7061,democracy on the doorstep isn't a threat to russia . it's a threat to putin's russia . but it represents hope for the people of russia .
7062,in the same way a can of mace is a threat to a rapist .
7063,a country joining nato is only really a threat to you if you intend on invading said country ... so ... get fucked ?
7064,"my home town is a former battlefield and it was torn in half after the continuation war . to have my great grandparents work nullified , as they sacrificed blood and tears to keep this country independent . finland has to join nato , end of story . it may not be perfect , but it's hell of a lot better than what russia would plan up . ( mass killings of civilians , forced conscription , re-education camps , the geneva convention checklist )"
7065,"maybe if anything anyone does is a threat to you , you are the problem ."
7066,russia is a bloody threat to the world 
7067,"russia is a threat to everyone . that said , finland has a better trained and equipped military than russia ."
7068,"you did that . you forced finland to do that . quote from finnish predisent . "" look in the mirror """
7069,the shadow the potted plant on your windowsill casts at sunset is also a threat to russia

7071,"theres a saying that applies hereif you meet an asshole occasionally , you met an asshole . if you meet assholes all the time , then youre an asshole ."
7072,"finland is only a threat if you invade them , maybe dont do that"
7073,"noone wants russia , noone wants to invade it , tis a shit hole , they are the only threat"
7074,"you aint seen nothin yet , baby ."
7075,the feeling is mutual .
7076,ya and not you people sending planes or threatening them.....no they are the threat and you russia are cuddly bunny
7077,russia is definitely a threat to russia at this point
7078,"no russia , that is not a threat . if you leave everybody alone , i'm sure everybody will leave you alone ."
7079,russia is a threat to everyone so 
7080,">"" this cannot fail to arouse our regret , and is a reason for corresponding symmetrical responses on our side ,"" kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told reporters ."" russia still thinking / acting like it's a superpower / peer . there's no "" symmetry "" in the balance of power ."
7081,well russia definitely a threat to finland so fuck you
7082,oh shut the fuck up russia !!
7083,what isn't a threat to russia according to the kremlin ? it seems that anything short of total subservience and obedience is the only thing that isn't a thteat .
7084,you know who has been the greatest thayt to russia historically ? russia ...
7085,russia's biggest threat is themselves .
7086,russia made its bed and now has to lay in it
7087,"russia seems to think everybody is a threat . maybe if putin minded his borders & stayed within them , russia would not be hated by all ."
7088,does this kinda announce their intention to want to one day attack finland ?
7089,other countries existing is a threat to russia other countries not existing is a threat to russia russia is a threat to russia it's threats all the way down ...
7090,kremlin says any country that protects itself from russia is a threat to russiaessentially
7091,maybe russia should have thought about that before russia started invading people and became a threat to surrounding areas ?
7092,russia just admitted that they want to invade other countries - and joining nato is a way of preventing them from doing that .
7093,weird not like russia has ever invaded finland before .... and russia has such a good track record to honor the treaties it signs ....
7094,does russia really not understand that nato is a defensive alliance ?
7095,anyone in nato : breathes russia : you just threatened me !
7096,well ... don't wantonly attack your neighbors and they won't feel forced to create alliances .
7097,"correct me if i'm wrong but isn't nato a defensive alliance ? like there's an expectation of members to intervene in case of a member being attacked on it's soil but the same doesn't apply if a member is the aggressor , right ?"
7098,russia gatekeeping finlands sovereign rights by definition means that finland is not safe from russia .
7099,kremlin says recent gust of wind is most certainly a threat to russia . blames continent of south america for this outrage .
7100,"if russian antics stopped being so antagonistic and aggressive , maybe we wouldn't need to have a defensive treaty organization in europe . but you know ."
7101,russia has been using fear to control countries for decades . it is good to see that they are no longer feared .
7102,the biggest threat to russia is russia
7103,maybe this would not happen when you russian fucktards would not have attacked ukraine . once again .
7104,this is only true if russia has intentions of invading finland . so the only logical response is for finland to join nato .
7105,""" as we observe the native kremlin mouthpiece , take note of how easily threatened it is ."" "" crikey ! i just accepted an invitation to join some friends and it scared the poor thing terribly !"" "" it ' makes a lot of noise but only has one real defense , which it can not use without destroying itself . perhaps this explains it's fear ."" "" lets back off a little and see how it reacts to a javelin missile hitting one of its threatening moves designed to prevent people from thinking it is scared of it's own shadow ."" "" oh wait , no , a tractor has taken care of that . crikey they really didn't like that ! see you next week !"" \~ steve irwin's ghost ."
7106,"everyone was totally with russia , when they had crimea , and was ready to give away eastern ukraine...and what did you do ? tried to take it all , with a promise of a coup and you brought military parade uniforms and riot gear ."
7107,russia invading ukraine and silently taking over belarus is a huge threat to finland
7108,and in other news 93 % of the worlds population has hard evidence that the kremlin is a threat to the entire world .
7109,"russia talking about consequences if finland joins nato , while simultaneously showing them the consequences of not joining"
7110,"nato is not there to attack russia , its there to protect itself from russia . those dense cunts should stay in their shithole and let people live their lives , this way there will be no threat for anyone . but they know it already"
7111,threat to russias threatening plan . ftfy
7112,it's a threat to russia's imperial ambitions yeah .
7113,don't join nato or we will be forced to invade you ! * currently invading country because they are not in nato .*
7114,"if a country joining a defensive alliance is a threat to you , then you are the threat ."
7115,"russia be threatening the world with nuclear , like they won't get hit from all angles .. lol"
7116,"i brushed my teeth this morning , which i understand is also a threat to russia"
7117,"for the last time russia . nobody wants to invade you . you're not worth it . belgium , canada , denmark , france , iceland , italy , luxembourg , netherlands , norway , portugal , the united kingdom , and the united states founded nato as a defensive measure against the soviet union . if several nations band together in a mutual defense alliance against your nation . then you are doing something wrong . do better ."
7118,russia is a threat to russia lol
7119,"1 ) nobody wants to attack russia . 2 ) russia keeps attacking neighbors . 3 ) russia feels constantly threatened by everything . russia : please , just sell your oil and gas while there's still a market for fossiles and invest the gains into your infrastructure and economy ( just like saudi arabia urgently needs to do ) instead of attacking ukraine or finland , so you can have a modern economy after fossile fuel money dries up ."
7120,"it's not a threat to russia , it's a threat to crazy vlad's invasion of western europe . nato's never been about expansion , it's always been about stopping russia's aggression ."
7121,"nukes aside , finland would whoop russias ass in a war if russia tried to invade ."
7122,russia made it clear that they will attack any neighbours not taking orders from the kremlin . the rush to join nato is a direct response to their aggression . putin has only himself to blame .
7123,"i find it amazing russia is telling countries not to join nato , but all that is doing is making them join nato ."
7124,"it is funny how austria and switzerland can chill being surrounded by nato , and yet that fucking incel state is somehow threatened by it ."
7125,"they can barely handle ukraine , their army is ill equipped & poorly trained for the most part , nato would roll their ass over . russia is weak & toothless without their nuclear arsenal & constant threats of nuclear war ."
7126,russia is the one who's making their fears come true . all this is happening because of the invasion .
7127,"dear russia . no one what's your frozen hellscape and crumbling infrastructure . \- sincerely , the world ."
7128,"and unless you want hell rained down on you , you arent going to do shit about it , little man ."
7129,this might be the finnishing blow for russia .
7130,a tractor is a threat to russia .
7131,kremlin wrong again . the threat is to finland if they dont join nato .
7132,guess what russia ? finland decides what's best for itself and you have no say in the matter .
7133,actions meet consequences .
7134,umm ... russia moving an army westward is definitely a threat to finland ...
7135,* russia attacking a sovereign nation * look at what youre making me do! 
7136,you know you are a fucked up government when you consider a defensive alliance as a threat to your offensive ability . fuck russia .
7137,funny how nato has never initiated a war yet russia tries to convince the world it's a threat .
7138,i wonder why their joining nato you dumb mofos .
7139,""" stop trying to protect yourself against me "" ~ russia"
7140,russia has such a victim mentality . they start shit and then act like it's everyone else's fault . they are like the amber heard of countries
7141,"i think the lesson is : if you dont want countries joining nato , quit invading them ."
7142,it's only a threat if they plan to attack finland ... that's how nato works . it's a defensive pact . how many countries has finland invaded ? now how many has russia invaded ?
7143,"bitch , dont fuck with finland and it aint gon be an issue ."
7144,"kinda sucks we gave so much attention and "" fear "" to russia this past decade . def gave the kremlin a big head no american actually gives a flying fuck about russia . now they think they're scary to the west . lol yes the west is more than america , but the us is where the media comes from , the us is what russia most cares about ."
7145,russia is a threat to russia
7146,"sucks to suck , russia . deal with it ."
7147,"great , they can repeat the 1939 debacle and demonstrate , again , how inept they are ."
7148,"many might not realise just how ready we finns are to fight in a war if someone were to try and invade us . unlike in the us , where someone being in the military is seen as something very respectable and something that not everyone can do , in finland it's just the norm . you've served in the military ? big deal , so has nearly everyone else . your grandpa was a veteran ? of course he was , everyones grandpa was . but if you mention that you've done civil service instead of military service , or worse yet , you admit that you've been freed from mandatory service , you'll face an endless barage of insults calling you a traitor , a loser , a coward etc . there aren't many countries in europe left where serving in the military is just a natural part of being a man and growing up ."
7149,"finland , poland and lithuania have real and substantial multigenerational axes to grind with russiaand heres putin daring all of his neighbors to bring a finding out demise to his fucking around ass ."
7150,"at this point if it were to be a conventional war with europe , it looks like the west would absolutely mop the floor with the ruzzians . that's excluding the u.s . everyone thought russia was the empire but they're more like space balls ..."
7151,"finland * existing * is a threat to all russians , lol git gud skrubs "
7152,only aggressors would worry about someone joining a * defensive * pact .
7153,someone i know personally is finish . if finland is attacked they will immediately be drafted into the war even though they are no longer living in finland . putin & russia have already destroyed one country . we cannot alow them to do it again . finland must join nato before russia can mobilise any forces or fire any weapons into finland . we can bearley do anything to help ukraine except sending roughe soldiers & some weapons . but we would be able to help finland by adding them to nato quickly .
7154,"oh please , putler is so antsy for an excuse that to many mosquitos in the kremlin is ' a threat to russia '. maybe we should thank the little man , in the end he might unite all of us freedom loving peoples . the future holds one nato ! and 0 fascists ."
7155,russia needs to stfu and go home .
7156,the whole world could join nato and nobody would have to kill anymore .
7157,the largest threat to russia is.......russia !
7158,it'd be easier to make a ( short ) list of what is not a threat to russia instead of complaining about everything being a threat .
7159,yeah defensive pacts are definitely a massive threat ...
7160,"until putin , russia itself was in an alliance with nato . what , was russia a threat to russia back then ? putin has had decades in which to establish an attractive alternative to nato for russia's neighbors . he has done fuck-all in that time . it is hard to be sympathetic ."
7161,"russia is threatened , it's not a threat . what a sad scared little man ."
7162,this adds the nordic states to natos presence in the artic . an area moscow is very interested in controlling and exploiting .
7163,then i guess putin's foreign policy has caused a real threat to russia . maybe russia should get rid of putin .
7164,i guess all the good kids at school should line up to let the bully beat them up one by one .
7165,"only if russia defines "" peace "" as reserving the right to invade neighbors safely"
7166,who does russia think they are finland has to do what they say because russia feels threatened ?? news flash russia your country sucks and nobody wants anything to do with it i promise you
7167,russia invading other countries is definitely a threat to russia .
7168,"actually , even if the reality wouldn't be the exact opposite , finland joining nato is lowering the threat towards russia because finland as a nato member cannot now just willy-nilly attack any other country anymore . :-)"
7169,"finland joining nato ( now ) is a direct result of russia invading ukraine , can't they see that ? who ordered the invasion of ukraine ? putin . so putin effectively caused finland to join nato , putin is therefore a direct threat to russia . time to take retaliatory steps against putin , russia . we're waiting ."
7170,russia is the biggest threat to russia
7171,"i don't get how it's a threat . i get why they perceive it as a threat , but it's really only a threat if they intend on invading finland . not invading finland seems like a decent option to avoid conflicts , right ?"
7172,russia : ( applause ) we did it boys ! were the new north korea . great work everyone! 
7173,"russia needs to just fuck off , already . the only threat to russia right now is russia . no one wants russia other than russians . they need to stop thinking everyone wants their land so bad . everyone else is happy not being russian ."
7174,currently russia is definitely a threat to russia .
7175,"always has been and probably always will be , that has never changed ."
7176,russia is a threat to russia right now ....
7177,in an conventional war with russias current state my money would be on finland .
7178,they wouldn't even close to win that battle . ukraine is causing them more problems than afghanistan did .
7179,> currently ~~ russia ~~ putin is definitely a threat to ~~ finland ~~ world .
7180,russia : why arent you letting me attack you? 
7181,"finland has a history of being neutral alongside sweden . it's pretty funny that russia pushed them over the edge to join nato due to their aggression yet they just refuse to acknowledge that hey , maybe if we treat our neighbors like crap , they'd eventually get sick of us ."
7182,i dont recall finland invading a sovereign country . did i miss that story ? do they have a special operation somewhere ? any who welcome to the squad finland . ( when its official ) good to have you on board
7183,good luck for russia trying to act on it now . the uk has given a security guarantee . that's a nuclear power telling another nuclear power to fuck off pre-emptively .
7184,"the idea that russia has legitimate concerns about nato aggression is ridiculous . the only reason putin had the hutzpah to invade ukraine in the first place is because he was reasonably sure that western powers had no stomach for a war with russia . he doesn't want ukraine to join nato because at that point he can no longer interfere with it ( at least militarily ) without risking a war with every nato country . he considers ukraine to be within russia's traditional sphere of influence and if he loses the ability to control it with military action then ukraine is free to choose it's own destiny , and he knows they would likely choose to align with the west ."
7185,and he is just blatantly ignoring the fact that russia/ussr invaded finland in ww2 and took away a significant chunk of their territory after first ask to get it for free . like the only threat to finland is russia and it is a real threat . if not they would not still have conscription .
7186,a defensive pact is a threat to warlike imperialists only . in the face of such imperialists not joining such a pact would be fraught with danger .
7187,nato is a defensive alliance . kremlin knows that . kremlin just pissed can't bully and invade without consequences anymore . was that their plan ? looks like it . so stfu terrorist state .
7188,and we can see how not joining nato worked for ukraine .
7189,"russia invading other countries on its borders is a clear threat to all countries on its borders , including finland . theyd be crazy not to prepare a strong defensive strategy ."
7190,russia : * breaks into neighbors house * second neighbor : * installs burglar alarm * russia : this is an outrage !
7191,is it purple and are you scottish ?
7192,just imagine you are entitled to his home and his daughter somehow . now your thinking like putin
7193,really idiotic .
7194,"part of the expectation from this was likely that nato and the eu would do nothing to try to counter russia . had this occurred , the member-states were expected to feel that the groups were useless and that the people would demand that their country withdraw . additionally , any non-member would see the ineffectiveness of nato and then continue to not support joining . clearly , all of this completely failed and backfired . even with modest support from nato , ukraine has now become a legit force to deal with . as a power amplifier , any country shouod have good reason to join . on the other end , russia has been helping a fight in syria that has lasted for years , with no real end in sight ."
7195,"putin level --- not of idiocy , but of living in an authoritarian bubble where he killed the messenger who told him anything he didn't want to hear ."
7196,"it's not that they are idiotic . they aren't dumb , they are just playing dumb . that way they can have all the deniability possible for their citizens . look what the world is trying to do to poor us . whatd we ever do but try and help ukraine rid themselves of nazis . wahhhhh . we are the good guys wahhhhhh ."
7197,"if the trends in the us keeps going , we ( us ) will be a threat too . fucking bootlicking nazi fascist republicans would side with putin in a hot minute ."
7198,dont forget china
7199,limits the countries russia can bully and intimidate .
7200,they will tell you that nato could position nukes in finland and strike st . petersburg / moscow within minutes . etc etc
7201,it's a threat to their expansion dreams
7202,its a good question . finland and sweden are both already enhanced partners of nato and eu-members . estonia and norway are both already closer to russias strategic locations than finland would be .
7203,"that's the nature of russian thinking . everything is twisted to suit their feeling of superiority and their victim complex . everyone is out to get them , especially the evil nato that is totally not a defensive alliance . in their mind russia deserves to expand and create a buffer zone between russia and nato ( like warsaw pack served during the cold war ). they totally have the right to control the north-european plain . they really think they deserve to subjugate other countries if it serves their idea of security . they don't care about freedom of others . they don't care that conquering territory will put them closer to nato anyway . they don't care that their border with nato is only a few percent of total border length - nato is encircling russia , understood comrade ? and they don't care that nato can already put missiles into baltic states and it will be closer to moscow than anything in finland . it's just a twisted "" we need to conquer because we want peace for the mozzerland !"""
7204,"it doesn't matter how . you are trying to think rationally about an actor that is a sociopath , kleptocrat , murderer , pathological liar , misanthrope , with a long tradition in all kind of atrocities it denies . it just doesn't work . obligatory plug : here is a retired finnish intelligence colonel that understands and explains the russian mentality very well ( in 2018 ): there are proper subtitles in many languages ."
7205,"from a geopolitically neutral perspective : the same reason the us didnt like it when russia stationed missiles in cuba . its a threat to their sphere of influence . you have to remember , nato protects sovereignty . the warsaw pact countries were designed to reinforce obedience to russia under the guise of military protection - sort of like the mafia . from that lens , their immediate neighbours are showing blatant signs of disrespect that said , the minister is still hedging his bets , pointing out that theyll only escalate if there is a border violation ( ironic !), so as not to escalate the situation further and possibly commit to another front ."
7206,it makes them feel all insecure and sad about no longer being a global superpower that everybody has to placate and pay tribute to .
7207,"my guess is that this may result in a situation similar to what happened with turkey and the black sea . russia has access to the baltic sea , and should they want to send their navy to or from that area , they now have to navigate through nato's territory , or , even if there are international waters , they are still too close to other nato countries . this may particularly make sense if "" mainland "" russia needs to send its navy to kaliningrad ( former keningsberg ). i mean , it's all speculation , but it's what anyone could guess from just looking at the map ."
7208,"the funny thing is nato would be perfectly content to let putin live out his days getting ridiculously wealthy exploiting his own people , if russia would just mind its own business . putin is the biggest threat to himself and his country ."
7209,"this is like me telling my neighbour his security cameras and reinforced steel doors are a threat to me . yeah , maybe if i was trying to burgle his house . otherwise , it's not ."
7210,"completely logical conclusion that putin will never arrive at , sadly ."
7211,"* lavrov looks in the mirror * "" ew """
7212,"does anyone take what they say seriously at this point , other than some number of rubes in russia ?"
7213,"exactly , russia talks of the "" spread "" of nato , the only way nato can spread is by a country choosing to apply and join . so unless russia is planning to join , nato can't spread in to russia . nato can't attack , or invade it can only defend and intervene from an attack ."
7214,nato is also defensive only so even if finland was eyeing land that wouldn't be a nato issue
7215,"i think it's not the land , it's water . sweden and finland control large part of baltic sea . for russia , it's an important trade route , not to mention that it's the only way to get to kaliningrad without technically crossing the border . once finland and sweden are in nato , they may impose different laws around that part of the sea , which will be harder for russia to dispute . i'm not saying this * is * why russian diplomats say what they say , i'm just offering a plausible explanation for why russia , in general , might not want finland and sweden joining nato ."
7216,"exactly . when the war in ukraine starts going even worse than it is now , vlad will take a voluntary vacation from the kremlin ."
7217,""" we tried to punch him in the face but he slapped us back . can't you see how mean this guy is ?"""
7218,"objection , your honor ! why ? because it is devastating to my case ! overruled ."
7219,"i know , russian atack finland , lose war and they will capitulation . so russian territory atach to finland ) so russian's will live better after war with finland then with putin ) sorry for my mistakes english is not my native . i understand ukrainian , russian , belorussian and a half of poland language ."
7220,"here in finland , we have a saying : "" tyhmst pst krsii koko ruumis ."" * a stupid head will make the entire body suffer .*"
7221,in nl we say '' he who burns his ass has to sit on the blisters '' lol .
7222,which province is this from ? : d
7223,"yeah , we don't have that one lol"
7224,no fart necessary . the wind itself has destroyed 70 russian tanks in ukraine .
7225,and remember when russia signed an agreement in budapest to never invade ukraine in exchange for ukraine handing over their nuclear weapons to russia ? how did that work out ? russia can't be trusted . they don't even respect their own constitution .
7226,and the only ones who seem upset by this fact are russians and republicans . funny how the 2 work out like that .
7227,"this is the classic situation of "" call out the bully's bluff and suddenly you see how weak they really are ""."
7228,"if russia is losing most of its valuable assets playing grabass with ukraine , how can they think they have the resources to be a threat to anyone , aside from nuclear ? or is that the game now , to play nk ..."
7229,finland has developed a new weapon of mass destruction . \^\^ russia maybe
7230,every single iteration of russia has collapsed from within .
7231,"finnish defence forces did quite a nice video on how modern war between finland and russia would start and look like , english subtitles available :"
7232,not like finland have repelled a russian invasion before . and that was when russia had a military to be scared of . now their military is all smoke and illusions on a breezy day .
7233,"they could still cause significant damage to the infrastructure , like in ukraine ."
7234,"when asked about the recent russian threat , a finn declared "" there are already thousands of russian soldier in finland ."" the interviewer was puzzled and asked for clarification . "" yeah , they're all under about six feet of finnish dirt ."""
7235,it's a vastly different scenario though . afghanistan is/was a huge counterinsurgency operation . ukraine is a full on war with a near peer adversary .
7236,""" i just want finland to live in constant fear of annihilation and be unable to prevent an attack that may or may not happen . is that so much to ask ?"""
7237,thats the thing . it isnt so much a threat to russia as a threat to russias plans . nato wouldnt need to exist if russia stopped attacking their neighbors .
7238,they just want to be your big brother . the one who puts you in a headlock when mom isn't looking and punches you repeatedly in the face . family !
7239,"they are literally thinking this . lavrov just said that they want to stop the war , but that nato does not let them win , so they have to continue fighting . i'm just thinking "" what sort of idiot argues this line of thinking "". i assume it is only meant for putin . they are now all just trying to survive until putin croaks , they fear being suicided along with their families ."
7240,like the finnish pm said to putin : you did this .
7241,russia to finland in the near future : stop grabbing my weapons and soldiers to invade yourself
7242,russia to finland : stop resisting! 
7243,this is all your fault sop for abusers/murderers / psychos/maniacs
7244,"i can only hear this in captain holt's voice . "" why aren't you letting me attack you ? i specifically requested it ."""
7245,"this is literally a quote from the head of the russian foreign ministry : "" russia doesn't want ukraine to surrender , russia just want them not to resist """
7246,russia : finland stop hitting yourself! 
7247,finland has history of being neutral because the ussr pushed them over the edge into it .
7248,"oh no they acknowledge it . theyre just all sour that nobodys falling for their intimidation tactics anymore , and that theyve lost the upper hand ."
7249,"finland also has a history of being invaded by russia , so that also tracks ."
7250,"i read in the news today that since the invasion , nato-membership support in finland has gone from 20 % to 80 %. you know how hard it is to get an entire population of people to move that fast on an issue ?"
7251,"well you could make the argument that finland invaded the ussr during the continuation war , but ( as the name suggests ) that was part of the wider wars that started with russia invading finland ( the winter war )."
7252,> good luck for russia trying to act on it now . the uk has given a security guarantee . that's a nuclear power telling another nuclear power to fuck off pre-emptively . to a point . for the most part russia is too busy in ukraine for another war anyway . they will try cyber attacks and other such things . they expect russia to go heavy and try to influence someone to veto membership .
7253,"you are completely right . i am always surprised by the number of people who don't recognise the obvious illogic in russia's supposed fear of nato . if russia were actually convinced that nato were just itching to invade , why would they start a conflict which nato could effortlessly turn into an excuse to invade ? it takes half a second of thought for that excuse to completely fall apart , even before you think about the fact that they've given 20 other reasons to justify the invasion and are clearly just throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks ."
7254,"russia warns that alarm systems are a threat to their robbing , threatens to set fire to every house "
7255,"russia seems to think nato is just itching to start a fight . guys , you deployed novichok on uk soil and nato didnt do shit . they dont want to fight if they can avoid it . stop being big babies ."
7256,russian idiotic .
7257,"the other major expectations were : - ukraine would fold in days and not put up much of a fight ( and russia could then steamroll moldova , and threaten nato territory directly ) - the russian army would be as good in real life as it was on paper both dead wrong ."
7258,"> part of the expectation from this was likely that nato and the eu would do nothing to try to counter russia . has this occurred , the member-states were expected to feel that the groups were useless and that the people would demand that their country withdraw . additionally , any non-member would see the ineffectiveness of nato and then continue to not support joining . from russia's pov , this is a high-risk/high-reward thing . and it's not exactly shocking to see them try something like that . but you'd think that when the risk is this high , you'd do a shitload of research and planning first to make sure you don't screw up . that's what's so shocking - that they risked so much , and were * so wrong , and so incompetent *. not to defend putin , because it's ultimately all his responsibility and he deserves the blame - but it seems like the failures here were from the people under him . his intelligence agencies for giving him a bad analysis , and his generals for not knowing their own readiness . like , sure , hitler was a horrible guy - but early on , he made a lot of high-risk gambles that paid off due to competent political analysis and competent and honest generals ."
7259,im reminded of stalin who had his personal doctor arrested and tortured after suggesting stalin could benefit from additional bedrest .
7260,or he thinks the perceived threat level must continue to go up in order for him to stay in power .
7261,"half of them already do . a good chunk of my family already believes and speaks out about how the ukrainian president is just so disrespectful . i dont get it either . but they delved way too deep into the maga/q cult , so i honestly have no idea how far their delusions go ."
7262,their relatives that died in ww2 would be turning in their graves . they sacrificed their own lives so their ~~ ancestors ~~ descendants can be this fucking stupid .
7263,"which so far is still only at one ... belarus . they are bullying ukraine , but they definitely did not intimidate them . on the contrary , russia is now locked in a war with ukraine and are reaping the consequences ."
7264,estonia is literally right there though too . narva to st petersburg is under 150 km .
7265,"the only threat to russia is russia starting wars , but finland joining is a big deal for the immediate counterattack that would happen . a 1340 km neutral border is not the same as 1340 km of artillery about to fire . and with sweden joining as well , that's a lot of nato airspace ."
7266,"> it's just a twisted "" we need to conquer because we want peace for the mozzerland !"" i think it's called lebensraum ."
7267,"russia could have been like china . the top brass making money hand over fist . china was significantly poorer than russia previously , but only killed people within their borders ( in recent times ). now they are the manufacturing captial of the world ."
7268,hilarious
7269,i mean if he quite literally watched you loot and destroy your neighbors i think its justified
7270,im sure he knows . hes just a dick
7271,not really no . i wonder if the russians do either or if it is only the kremlin's gremlins that pretend to believe their sayings .
7272,"well we did just have an "" open letter "" by "" artists "" and "" intellectuals "" ( coining themselves "" the 28 "") in germany that were contra sending weapons to ukraine because peace is important . they had like 280k signatures on a change.org campaign - in other words no important number of people in germany . germany is a bit hesitant because we do genuinely hate war and don't want to be dragged into any unnecessary conflicts , but unless you either get paid handsomely by russia , or really love that russian dick , you don't really see not sending hardware as a peacekeeping option . hell , the green party is pro sending german hardware , which wouldn't even have been a believable onion headline a year ago . but germanies big russia understander alice schwarzer ("" why i understand putin despite all he did "" - 2014 after crimea ) wrote a public letter and at least the russian cronies/general idiots made themselves known now im just really curious if "" the 28 "" will go down in history worse than the anti covid artists did when they wanted to open up everything again in april of 2021 because they started noticing the shutdowns on their bottom line"
7273,"i wonder what makes many countries join nato ? it can't be that a certain country has a nuclear arsenal , a large standing army with multitude of capabilities , bases near borders and a government that likes to meddle outside of their own country . it would be preposterous ."
7274,that's a great saying .
7275,"antwerp ;) might be highly local though , accents/dialects here change noticeably every 50 miles or so ."
7276,and sunk their flagship . damn wind .
7277,bingo . russia not even being able to hold ground in ukraine makes it very dangerous to be putin right now . everyone is rallying together and now also realizing that russian military is a failure
7278,they are gonna keep messing around and be annexed by china .
7279,a grabass for donbass orchestrated by a dumbass .
7280,"no no ... the finnish have adopted a culture of nazism - russia , probably"
7281,"friends in finland already know where they'd be stationed should something happen . reserves know their roles . they don't want it but they won't shy from it , they know they have to risk fighting on their feet than ever letting russia rule over them on their knees ."
7282,it looks like they took the gary oldman approach to defense . russia attacks . finnish govt : bring me everyone . finland : everyone ? finnish govt : evvverrryonnnnee !!!
7283,"imagine some guy came to you and kicked you in the balls , you stand up , punch and win the fight . tell me : wouldn't you try to prevent getting kicked in the balls ? that said finland lost in the winter war , 9 % of their territory , that they haven't gotten back . and we see that this russia seems obsessed with "" finishing what it should have done right the first time "" whatever that means . finland wants insurance that russia won't try anything tricky . ukraine is proof that even preventing wwii style invasions can't be done with anything less than nato membership . and right now russia can't spread itself over more fronts , it's the perfect time to do it , once it happens , russian can't do shit anymore ."
7284,they still lost the war though . but this time its kinda different in many ways . russia is a nuclear power but their conventional army is severely weakened . finland has never really let their guard down . their army is well trained and well equiped . there are bunkers everywhere in finland . they are prepared for a war . russia isnt .
7285,"smoke , illusions , rust and vodka"
7286,ukraine has global support and will recover . russia is fucked .
7287,correct . i have no idea why putin thought russia was going to have an easier time with a more developed military .

7291,"if russia wanted to destroy nato long term , they would just behave for 300 years ."
7292,"funnily enough , there were people saying that exact same thing in nato . for a while , people ( even nato members ) were wondering if nato was worth it . it is an artifact of the cold war , does it serve a purpose ? maybe we should just get rid of nato to show that we are willing to walk out of the cold war era and into the future with russia as an ally . then putin decided to justify natos existence . many of those voices that doubted nato have stopped doubting nato . nato support has skyrocketed and has a new generation of young people that have suddenly become in favor for it . putin has given nato a boost in support , i am willing to bet that decades from now , nato will still have quite a bit of support ."

7294,"> former russian president dmitry medvedev , the deputy chairman of the powerful security council , has previously spoken about potentially stationing nuclear-armed missiles in the russian territory of kaliningrad on the baltic sea . yeah because thats gonna be a major change from how things have been since almost the last lifetime ."

7297,this would imply russia is god enough at fighting to bully a small child .
7298,policy of finlandization that has worn off since the cold war
7299,[ indeed ](
7300,this . finland was a co-belligerent against russia during wwii ( not allied with the axis but still at war with the ussr ). they avoided being gobbled up by russia on the grounds that they remain neutral . this is because if finland had been consumed by the ussr then sweden would now share a border with them . that would have made sweden far more inclined to join nato .
7301,"ya the jig's up on russia , the entire world now knows they're a paper tiger ( bear)...and getting weaker every day"

7305,yeah i'd call that just ending the ceasefire and restarting the winter war . you don't get to just take people's land and ethnically cleanse it and claim you're the one being attacked .
7306,"fucking finally ! the west is starting to understand what it means having russia as a neighbour . they will cut off their own leg if it means they can beat you to death in order to take your stuff . "" greater good "" is not part of the culture . it is pure "" kill or be killed """
7307,"it's projection . russia's itching to start a fight , so they believe everyone else must be as well ."
7308,the new catch phrase of the decade as in my godhow idiotic was that? russian idiotic. 
7309,never go full russian ....
7310,"all correct . putin fell victim to his own success : the chechen , georgian , and syrian campaigns were all brutal but successful , and the cyber-warfare/disinformation campaigns he ran ( with ex-intelligence officer skill and experience ) may be pound for pound ( or ruble for ruble ) the most successful psyops campaigns in history . his own success caught up to him and led him to believe things about his own judgment , military , economy , and the desire and capability of the countries of nato and the west to resist , which were horrendously and terribly wrong . now , he has blown twenty years of political and economic capital accrued through these successes ( recall that russias economy and population are relatively tiny , and despite this putin restored its role as a geopolitical power player ) on one immoral and disastrous gambit . the disasters keep piling up for russia . no matter what the outline now , it is a failure . good for democracy , good for nato and the west , terrible for russia and everyday russians . worst of all for ukraine and the ukrainians , who despite their battlefield success have suffered horribly . i hope he ends up like ghadafi ."
7311,"i think they also probably thought they had enough power that geopolitic super powers would be too scared to back ukraine , leading to a ww2 era appeasement situation . definitely pulled the rug out from under them when even switzerland supported ukraine ."
7312,"putin's underlings told him what he wanted to hear , which we all know is very far from the truth"

7314,"the people under him suffer from the soviet disease . the only thing that matters is what is put in an official report , the truth is irrelevant ."
7315,> but it seems like the failures here were from the people under him . he's been in power for two decades . who do you think appointed the people under him ?
7316,"tbf the previous invasions of crimea and georgia were research , they tested the west reaction to border encroachment , and liked what they saw . too bad their sample size was too small"
7317,i would be absolutely fucking astonished if we don't learn that the whole q business started as a russian psy-op anyway .
7318,quite ironic anyone involved with maga complaining of disrespectful behavior . trump's 2016 bid for the presidency was built entirely on it .

7326,bullying is a losey goosy term in this context ... its more like russia took a swing and ukraine pulled the knife they had specifically cause they knew russia was gonna try it at some point . now russia has a knife in their stomach and are getting beaten to a pulp and are crying like a fuckin bitch because they cant strong man . nukes do not an effective political tool make against a non-nuclear nation that isnt threatening your sovrenignity .

7330,"no its because nato pursues an aggressive expansionist policy !! russia would never dare do that , and is always so unfairly scapegoated by the big mean west !"

7338,nato : not allowing testicular offence
7339,in the early 90's when most countries reduced their army size and ammunition was cheap finland reinforced our defence forces and stocked up .
7340,"just for comparison sake between the two wars though : || ukraine war|winter war | |:-|:-|:-| | duration|78 days ( so far)|103 days | | rus./ussr forces|190,000 lowest est.|400,000 lowest est .| | rus./ussr kia|10 - 26k|120 - 196k | relative to the ukraine war , the winter war was absolutely catastrophic losses wise for the russian . finland had a population of approx . 4 million compared to ukraine's 40 million today , and the finns had barely any outside support other than foreign volunteers . yes they lost , but god the damage they inflicted in just 3 months against an exponentially larger force was astronomical ."
7341,"yes , but whole cities have been leveled . even if they are victorious , it's not something anybody wants to have in their country . most military attackers try to avoid infrastructure damage , because they plan to take over the land they conquered . the russian military seems to have different objectives ."
7342,putin has relegated russia to be a vassal state of china . the debt will be suffocating .
7343,"because he thought crimea was a demo of how it was going to happen . almost nobody did anything when they annexed crimea . donestk and luhansk have been semi-autonomous for almost a decade with everyone aware that they were supported by russian troops . in putin's eyes , the entire world knew what he wanted and nobody stopped him so all he had to do was escalate a little bit and he'd own all of ukraine . plus , before 2014 ukraine had been a de-facto satellite state of russia anyway . yanukovych had been an obedient lapdog for putin and the population had been largely quiet and compliant . he probably assumed that the independence movement of ukrainians could never have developed so much as to put up a huge fight in less than 10 years . he probably genuinely believed the propaganda that most ukrainians would welcome the russians as brothers ."
7344,he believed the fsb when they told him that the ukrainians wouldnt fight .
7345,"i was referring to the armies on paper . very similar equipment ( armored vehicles , small arms , artillery ). certainly russia has a decided advantage in the air and the water ( on paper ). obviously russian equipment maintenance and their tactics have beenunderwhelming to say the least . ukraine for the most part has been able to go toe to toe in the field with russia . the mujahideen would not be able to do that , nor would they have tried ."
7346,russia is a grease and beer stained wifebeater turned into a country
7347,i keep thinking that every time putin or any other russian official speaks .
7348,you made me hit you !!
7349,"the finnish move , which sweden is expected to replicate , confronts president vladimir putin with the very outcome he said his war in ukraine was designed to prevent - a further expansion of nato to russia's borders . "" finland joined the unfriendly steps taken by the european union towards our country . this cannot fail to arouse our regret , and is a reason for corresponding symmetrical responses on our side ,"" kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told reporters . finland's president and prime minister said earlier on thursday their country must apply to join the nato military alliance "" without delay . asked whether this presented a threat to russia , peskov said : "" definitely . nato expansion does not make our continent more stable and secure ."" russia's war has led both finland and sweden to move towards abandoning their long-held neutrality and seeking the shelter of the alliance's security umbrella ."
7350,"oh they're special alright . sincerely , a dane ."
7351,tomorrow sweden makes the same announcement . they will just ctrl+h finland to sweden .
7352,"i think any russian who knows history should know better than to fuck with finland too , it cost them around 150 thousand lives . kill ratio of about 1:6 , and about 1:100 destroyed tanks ratio in favor of finland ."
7353,"more like 50 , but hell they couldn't even make it to 20 the last time around ."
7354,300 ? nato was teetering on relevancy after 30 years of russia only sort of behaving itself .
7355,"300 years ? nato already had an existential crisis the last 3 decades . until a few weeks ago nato was gradually falling into a coma and slowly drifting off into oblivion . didn't really look like it'd survive for 30 years , nevermind 300 . but putin clearly is a big fan and wanted to revive it for at least a generation . ukraine was a big adrenaline shot ."
7356,first they'd have to go 20 without imploding .
7357,"the maga cult still opposes nato , because trump already put his stamp on getting rid of nato , which has zero to do with him cozying up to putin , who absolutely doesn't have any dirt on trump to blackmail him with ."

7359,eventually the people who made the lies die and all that's left are the ones that believed them to take over
7360,"they don't . they're not posturing for the international audience , they're posturing for the domestic one . they need to present russia as the wounded , aggreived party so that their people don't start to ask awkward questions ."

7363,"no , retaliatory strike is guaranteed . better not to strike at all , since russia would not dare to strike for the same reason . the only way to win this game is not to play it ."

7374,"i was walking around my town and saw a handmade sign sticking out of someones window that said trump or communism . the message is whatever , run of the mill right wing bullshit . what is unusual to me is that someone took the time to create and mount this sign . that kind of motivation is , in my experience , unusual . that is something that trump has that i havent really seen before , this very motivated , dedicated hardcore base who are still hanging trump signs/flags/bumper stickers years after he lost and should have been disgraced . just some food for thought ."
7375,"fox news , which is very popular , is pretty much a russian propaganda earpiece . not only do they downplay what has been happening in ukraine , but they use a soviet era propaganda tool called "" whataboutism "" where it basically creates a false equivalency , thus making any criticism hypocritical mix that with an age group that takes things at face value and are easily influenced and you have a massive issue"
7376,"was at bar the other day and everyone started chanting "" let's go brandon "" and after 2 chants it went to "" fuck joe biden "". gas stations have stickers with biden pointing at the price with the caption "" i did this !"" all over the place . gas is still less than $ 5 a gallon . there's large segments of the population ( mostly poor or uneducated ) that are objectively indoctrinated at this point ."

7391,finland had terrain on her side . and winter . ukraine has steppes and very mind winter .
7392,essentially the definition of a pyrrhic victory .
7393,"what ukraine need is finnish geographical location , it played huge role in winter war ."
7394,this whole thing seems like a toddler breaking his old toys so mom can't give them away . if i can't have them nobody can .
7395,their goal is to set ukraine back so they remain the sole distributor of oil and gas . too bad they made sure europe go green as fast as possible
7396,"i am hopeful that once finland joins nato , even if russia is stupid enough to try to invade finland , nato forces will quickly and resoundingly repel them before they can lay waste to finnish cities . of course , there's always the fear that russia will resort to its final ace-in-the-hole , but we all hope their nuclear arsenal is as rusty as the rest of their ragtag army ."
7397,"and that could probably get china on the same side as eu . rebuilding and the contracts that will follow will have to be huge and eu will pay for a big chunk of it , we promise them an equal foothold in the rebuilding efforts and steel will flow again making china cool of russia for a while . providing they figure out the energy side of the equation ."
7398,"there was an unauthenticated twitter thread from a supposed fsb analyst that basically said if any of their scenario analysis reports predicted a weakness or failure of russian assets they were punished , demoted , yelled at . so all their low level analysts were basically bullied into making reports like russian army best in world , would squash kiev in 3 days! air superiority predicted in 12 hours they basically werent encouraged to make accurate predictionsif you believe the post was authentic ."
7399,reminder that russia decriminalized wife beating ( domestic assault for those who like arguing semantics ) as long as you dont maim or kill her .
7400,russia is like a fat old guy that keeps sending dick pics to strangers and gets explosively angry when told he should have a doctor look at that bump .
7401,turned into a country you mean ?
7402,"and we just found out he aint that big , it was michael cera wearing a muscle suit ."
7403,this is literal and figurative . they decriminalized domestic violence .
7404,a mafia run gas station pretending to be a country .

7407,[ y'all got any more of them former-ussr satellite states ?](
7408,"heck , had they behaved in 2008 and not done anything then , nato might have broken up by now . there's enough left wing support in europe that's anti nato , that if they didn't invade other nations , people with power might have pulled money from nato . instead , not only did they make nato more relevant than ever , they managed to make countries that were even neutral to the nazi's pick a side and made germany take up arms ."
7409,"and after several years of uncertainty and skepticism , thankfully now russia has reaffirmed that both nato and the eu are necessary alliances to have . thanks vlad !"
7410,i keep thinking about this . if trump had won a second term what would the last few months have looked like ? it feels pretty clear to me at this point that having a puppet in the white house was part of putin's plan for invading ukraine .
7411,"given what has been exposed if trump , what putin has on him must be beyond normal perversions . has he killed rivals ? did the kgb kill someone for him ?"
7412,"lmao , that's what google gives when you right click on a location :("

7414,"i can't think of all the shit russia has done , it's exhausting to list it all . fucking lunacy that some people look at this collection of cretins running rf and believe one iota . they fucking lie to one's face and expect you to thank them because the light comes from the east ."
7415,i can't believe this quote passed me by . surprised i haven't seen it mentioned more !
7416,shoot your self in the head so the bullet hits the person next to you .
7417,i don't know it for a fact but goddamn it sure rings true .
7418,i'm convinced that russia has been embedded in 4chan for years
7419,"oh lots of consipracy theories were pushed on 4chan . there are very serious shit happening over there from time to time , let's not pretend 4chan is only populated by ironic memermen ."
7420,the irony is that if trump comes back most likely the same type of communism as we see in china now where rich with their corporations enjoy the capitalism but the rest of the country will get screwed especially those that do not support the orange turd .
7421,you ever actually watch russian tv ? it's like fox news for people who find fox news too highbrow and intellectual .
7422,"this is something i cant understand , how is it that mostly the rural areas with the poorest population end up supporting republicans the party that constantly screws them over and only looks out for the rich "
7423,the gas station stickers are especially hilarious because gas prices are sky-high in other countries as well .
7424,> there's large segments of the population ( mostly poor or uneducated ) that are objectively indoctrinated at this point . you don't need to go far to witness it either / r/asktrumpsupporters
7425,yeah well the minority is about to control the rest of us . i hate it here lately .
7426,probably because right wing nut jobs are pro russia . so it would not fit the narrative .
7427,and an underground city to withstand a nuclear strikes . 900 000 soldiers in reserve and 300 000 soldiers in field army .
7428,finland truly is randy quaid in independence day
7429,"> 60,000 german losses to 700,000 soviet loses jesus , is russia just horrible at fighting or something ? every other battle i hear about has them losing orders of magnitude more soldiers than everyone else . it's just sad ."
7430,that's the point i'm making . but ukraine also has immense foreign backing and a way bigger population to draw from to compensate . if finland was invaded again they'd have all the same geographic advantages as last time plus the benefits of foreign backing this time around .
7431,"ukraine does have a terrain advantage that apparently played a big role in the early weeks of the war , called the [ rasputitsa ]( essentially because ukraine is so flat and grassy , when the snows melt after the winter , all that melt water just sits on the ground . that combined with wet weather makes for some very muddy terrain that makes it hard to do things like move armies through . it's why the russian convoys and vehicles spent most of the early war restricted to the paved roads and highways ( and why they were such easy targets ). it's honestly surprising that the russians didn't see this coming , considering it's the same advantage they used in pretty much every defensive war they've fought ( when people talk about the russian winter defeating armies , that also includes the mud )."
7432,"yeah , igor and his letters . i think the first one or two were possibly authentic but then the guy discovered he had an audience . i'm not sure if the follow up ones were , but certainly the idea of low level fsb analysts telling their bosses what they wanted to hear is very credible ."
7433,i think it requires hospitalization to be illegal if i remember right . you can beat the shit out of someone with you fist where they can barely move for a week but never require hospitalization
7434,""" come on finland , you better not join nato . check out this pic of my huge , throbbing nuclear arsenal .""

7435,"the "" bump "" being that tiny baby dick putin can't swing ."
7436,turned into a cunt you mean ?
7437,"i obsess over the hypotheticals here too . if trump was still in office , this war would very much be only a europe problem . the reason the maga cult is against globalism is because they simply cant look past the tips of their noses ."
7438,"easy . trump had already spent years distancing us from our allies and declaring nato a waste of money . if trump had stolen a second term the us would have left nato , and without the us leading the charge in supporting ukraine it would have been annexed and their president would have been assassinated since they wouldn't have the benefit of us intel . europe would have to start heavily investing in their own defense but it would be far too late for ukraine . it isn't hyperbole to say that defeating the republicans in 2020 was a turning point in history ."
7439,"he would have immediately - at putin's behest - began running down ukraine and talking about how it was full of nazis . then the anti-nato talk would really ramp up . and finally the us would have conveniently broken away from nato right as the ukrainian invasion was to begin , with the us officially being neutral . you can and i would argue that biden has been a terrible president...but holy shit the alternative was so , so much worse ."
7440,"well , a small exercise on "" if trump had won "": \- nord stream ii pipeline would have been completed and commissioned , locking europe ( germany ) once and for all in the hands of russia's energy . \- us would probably be dealing with some shenanigan back in afghanistan , keeping their defense sector "" busy "" on cleaning it ... \- trump would be enamoring and supporting boris johnson , marine le pen , and other shitheads to keep digging divides onto eu/nato ... of which putin would be most pleased since he got kicked in the teeth by ukranians joining eu/nato ... \- a weak post brexit eu + a weak nato would carve the way for putin to press a "" soft "" invasion of ukraine , maybe just with an assassination of zelensky or even waiting for trump to keep undermining him and he losing elections ( remember , ukraine was not "" approved "" for both applications before the war )... \- xi boy would be already preparing to pounce on taiwan after the olympics ... just my 2 cents ."
7441,"i am almost sure that russia planned to invade ukraine before trump left , but covid wrecked their plans . had it happened , the russian invasion would not have been as disastrous as it has been today ."
7442,"> i keep thinking about this . if trump had won a second term what would the last few months have looked like ? "" our thoughts and prayers are with ukraine "" that's about it ."
7443,the scarier part is that blatant puppet still has a realistic chance of getting back in .
7444,"its his complete subsidization by russia mafia , i suspect . hes not a billionaire . hes a russian puppet and putins little bitch ."
7445,sounds like they are handing out raw floating point numbers .
7446,"its a gem , i break it out as often as i can ."
7447,this . russia didnt start qanon but theyve unarguably amplified it as much as possible ; according to their geopolitical doctrines they would be remiss not to .
7448,"> i'm convinced that russia has been embedded in 4chan for years they definitely have , just like they take advantage of other social media platforms and spread disinformation , far-right talking points and conspiracies . like on reddit for example :"
7449,"people roll their eyes at me when i say it but the process occuring here is * exactly * the process that led to the theocracies we've been bombing for 30 years . rural religious hardliners backed by foreign and corporate interests break the political system with violence and corruption . cities become prisoners of the empty land between them and the backwards , angry people that are sprinkled throughout it ."
7450,"if you take a group of poor and mostly uneducated people that who consider themselves victims of a changing world and economy and give them am enemy and reason for their problems they will fall in line . i grew up in very rural pa and it was very obvious to see . the modern world is leaving them behind and the pace of their decline is only accelerating . unfortunately , this is a prime demographic for power to manipulate ."
7451,the pithy but not wrong answer : fox news .
7452,"in the road to wigan pier , orwell notes that the reason socialists like him can't connect with the working class of the country is because they're too smart for them and it offends these yokels"
7453,"> supporting republicans republican support hinges on either two groups of people : you're incredibly wealthy and want more tax cuts , or you're uneducated and are afraid of whatever latest boogeyman culture war topic fox news brings up . most republicans falls in the latter category . public education is supported by property taxes , so poor people will attend poorly funded schools . those poorly funded schools churn out poorly educated people . poorly educated people can't improve their economic situation because they're poorly educated and the vicious cycle continues to the next generation ."
7454,"the fundamental problem is the simple-but-wrong message that an idiot understands ( gas prices high , therefore biden must be responsible ) is always going to be far more effective for the american public than the complex-but-correct explanation . and that is depressing as hell ."
7455,"in finland , most far-right groups are very anti-russia . finnish nationalism has long been tied to resisting russian attacks . it's actually fairly similar to ukraine in the sense that there actually are anti-russian far-right groups ( like azov battalion ), but russia is vastly overstating the pull those groups have ."
7456,it's not as simple . in my country far-left nut jobs are pro-russian and pro-puttin and the far-right is very opposing to it .
7457,"it's russia's narrative , they'll make it fit like they always do . they don't care if what they say is accurate or not ."
7458,"ha-ha-ha ! hello , boys ! i'm baaaaaack !"
7459,"hahah ! filled up to eyeballs with koskenkorva , coffee and snuf brought from our brothers in sweden at the northern borderline . "" one helluva day to quit drinking ...."""
7460,"yes , they're terrible . russia has mostly always been a very highly populated country . especially in the last century . for example , in ww1 even . russia had about 85 million people compared to 65 for germany , 40 for the uk + france , and even the us had 87 million people . obviously , now it matters little about how many people you have past a certain point and much more about how much equipment and the quality of equipment you have . at the end of the day - despite having 1/2 the population , the uk has a lot better equipment and a lot more money . past a certain point , thats what matters . ( imo )."
7461,"because * all * you hear about are the big ticket battles or the battles in the later stages with the highest casualty counts . general subreddit knowledge of the red army in ww2 ends with the battle of kursk and resumes with the battle of berlin . but yes , the eastern front was ludicrously bloody . there's there's reason why if you look at russian age pyramids , especially one from the 1990s or earlier , you see a * massive * disparity between the number of men and women ."
7462,they're real life zergs
7463,"or alternately , if they do need medical attention , just don't take them !"
7464,"technically speaking from a purely numbers standpoint , nato has fewer non-retired nuclear warheads than russia . how many russia has that actually work or can be used is another story ."
7465,"yes , that's the joke"
7466,"right . someone report this bastard . that is both a threat , and an affront to good taste . also , if someone can hook me up with a supplier of surstrmming in australia , i would very much appreciate it . the neighbours , and inevitable hazmat response team will hate you though ."
7467,could you in theory be sent to trial for warcrimes for using biological and chemical warfare if you let say fire away surstrmming-barrels with artillery ?
7468,"damnit , i got nothing besides your language ."
7469,ah i call those cans swedish crowd dispersal grenades !
7470,> if putin invaded ukrainia some years ago i would bet that even brexit would not have happened . a lot of things wouldn't have happened . russia was doing a lot better fucking things up for everyone else when they * weren't * at war .
7471,> the reason the maga cult is against globalism is because they simply cant look past the tips of their noses . they think they can apply small-town ideology to federal government policy . then when it goes to shit they blame the government .
7472,"trump would have probably given some lip service very sad , that situation in ukraine , given anemic humanitarian supportthen told his simps its a europe problem and ended it at that"
7473,"and yet , we really screwed humanity down a hole in 2000 by not electing gore , and did catastrophe damage in 2016 with trump that we still may very well not survive . boy , it sure seems like every 4 years the republicans pose an existential threat to humanity , with various periods of delay until impact ."
7474,and moldova would probably be annexed too . huge numbers of russian troops would be massed on the eastern flank of baltic nato countries including finland . russia would have complete control of ukrainian wheat to go along with the european dependence on russian oil and gas . they would threaten to cut off access to all of it unless nato started making concessions like withdrawing from the old soviet union states . the world would be in an even worse place than it is now .
7475,biden has not been a terrible president . such bullshit created by the loud voices on both sides of the aisle . 1 . he is not a progressive 2 . he is not a republican 3 . he has almost no support from congress ( see point 1 and 2 ) what do you want from him ? the government was built for the explicit purpose to make change slow and hard .
7476,difficult to argue against .
7477,or maybe they've built a database to track individual atoms .
7478,"damn , i thought you were kidding . it's a legit quote , amazing !"
7479,the same thing happened in turkey .
7480,"same with russia saying that ukrainian govt is full of nazis,we had 1 or 2 nationalists in govt,like 3 years ago.and thats it ."
7481,"wait , what ? what country is that ?"
7482,having their entire army wiped out by a computer virus made for windows 95 does sound very russian
7483,"russia doesn't even have the population any more . going with the comparison to the uk , despite having twice the population , russia actually only has around 40 % more people between the ages of 20-25 ( i.e the prime age for a professional soldier ). their demographic issues are horrendous even by the standards of europe , with its own ageing population ."
7484,russia has just thrown bodies at a problem and managed to win just because of cheer numbers of soldiers . but if you look at their losses then its hard to call it a win .
7485,"russia , where the men fall out of windows and the women fall down stairs ."
7486,prosecutors hate this one trick
7487,could that be due to the fact russia doesn't seem to retire any equipment ?
7488,"so smaller dick , but nato is clean , friendly , and has a nice house and sports cars ."
7489,"i read somewhere about the american army , or something , trying to develop a smell that incapacitates people as a non-lethal weapon . figured this was the way to go ."
7490,yes . [ you'll be found guilty in germany and evicted .](
7491,their method if counting 
7492,"classic keep your government hands off my medicare crowd . if folks dont understand issues and dont want to , you know what the best solution is ? dont vote !"
7493,"he absolutely would have concern for "" both sides "" as "" they both have wonderful people """
7494,he'd toss the refugees in poland some paper towels and call it a day .
7495,the trump admin would not have given them all the crucial intel they have received and that's a pretty big deal
7496,trump would've parroted the russian propaganda about ukraine being run by nazis and reiterated that he fully trusts putin .
7497,didnt trump think the us was attacking ukraine ? maybe he would have send military support for russia .
7498,it bugs me that a lot of the same progressives who wouldn't vote for hilary now bash biden . progressives are often their own worse enemy .
7499,not only is it a legit quote but its also one that is not based on hyperbole but grounded in factual events .
7500,"in my case portugal . both the portuguese communist party and , to a lesser extent , the leftist block are supportive of putin . the pcp was always against the eu and especially nato so they're pushing the narrative that nato is the one escalating things . on the other hand chega ( the party led by the portuguese donald trump ) seems to regard nato as an important alliance for our sovereignty ( they're pretty ultra-nationalistic so it's a big deal ) and is supportive of both ukraine and , if i'm not mistaken , he even suggested we're not helping enough ( we sent some old weapons to help ukraine and stuff like that ), but i might be misremembering the last part ."
7501,"> their demographic issues are horrendous even by the standards of europe and that's if you believe the official russian figures , in reality they are probably even worse . because if it is one thing we know , it is that russia lies and then double and tripple down on said lies ."
7502,"the us alone has twice the population , and the us military is not only numerically superior , but technologically as well , and we dont have to rely on foreign tech to pull it off . god , if it werent for nukes , the us by itself could curbstomp the fuck out of russia ."
7503,"> russia has just thrown bodies at a problem and managed to win just because of cheer numbers of soldiers not really . that was mostly just the invasion of finland and wwii . russian forces in the french revolutionary wars/napoleonic wars were not excessive . napoleans invasion army was a similar size to russian forces , and the french lost due to attrition . they lost the crimean war , despite deploying a larger force . they lost the russo-japanese war , despite having a significantly larger army compared to japans . they lost wwi because they did so poorly it triggered a revolution that let the soviets take control and capitulate to every german condition . that was also not the case for the russian civil war by either the reds or the whites . nor the polish-soviet war , which went to a standstill . really , from the end of catherine the greats reign , to the second world war , russia did not have significant military victories and did not take significant advantage of it's size and population to outlast an opponent in a war ."
7504,and yet there are people who believe any ukrainian would willfully be relocated to russia .
7505,the prosecutor probably beats his wife too .
7506,thats what i was thinking as well xd
7507,"most likely yeah . i believe they officially count like 6,000 warheads"
7508,"i think i remember reading that one of the speculated reasons that salt treaty was seen as good for the ussr was that large amounts of defective or otherwise crap warheads could be decommissioned , not substantially affecting their functional arsenal , whereas the west would be decommissioning perfectly good nukes . quantity over quality had always been the name of the game for russia ."
7509,i am danish and admit defeat here . our method of counting sucks balls .
7510,of course !!
7511,doesn't russia have nuclear warheads in kaliningrad ? thats basically behind nato eastern border . you cant get closer than that .
7512,what are they gonna do ? invade a sovereign country and start killing civilians ?
7513,they're called icbm's for a reason . fixed it .
7514,"enough of this stuff , its getting old . russia says a lot of things ."
7515,"nato has no reason to move nukes into sweden or finland . in addition , moving nukes on foreign soil is not done over night . this is russia moving the goal posts once again from "" if you join nato we're going to answer "" to "" if nato brings nukes to you we're going to answer "". the latter allows russia to tell it's people that it scared nato into not doing what they actually wanted to do . russia is such a 3rd grade thinker lol ."
7516,""" russia warns "" is the the new china's final warning ."
7517,bro we dont need to move them anywhere . we can already hit anywhere on the face of the earth at any time . its what happens when you upkeep your equipment .
7518,putin threating rhetoric is growing tiresome
7519,"putin - it's not really a threat is it . if you do it to us then we do it to you . the end of eveything for us and for you . i get crippling social anxiety , fear and loathing in a supermarket - you think the total and immediate vaporisation of me , my family and friends is about to worry me more ?"
7520,yes ! nuclear threat for the day by russia . now we can return to regular programming .
7521,i don't think nato has been or is moving nuclear forces closer to russia . there's no interest in doing it since the submarines are enough ?
7522,putin is looking and sounding like a worried pussy
7523,"this is the setup for disinformation about nato ( which doesn't have nuclear weapons , only member states do ) moving nuclear weapons closer ( which member states don't have to do since they can already hit russia from where their nukes are currently )."
7524,"> moscow has no hostile intentions towards finland and sweden hilarious , because they said the same thing about ukraine . they also said multiple times they have absolutely no intention of invading ukraine , yet here we are ."
7525,jerkingoffmotion.gif
7526,"at this rate , russia is becoming west korea"
7527,"jesus h . christ , russia can you just do us all a favour and fuck off already ?"
7528,"russian warns ukraine , if you dont give up your nukes we'll invade you . russia a few years later "" lolz j/k here we come ""."
7529,the fact that oil can still be used as a power pawn in today world screams to us that we need to be working on reliant alternative . places like russia and saudi arabia should not be allowed this much power . we need to be working together to make these sources of fuel/energy laughable options .
7530,"these threats only serve to reassure finland and sweden that they are making the right decision . a few months ago most people believed it was unthinkable that putin would green light a full scale invasion of ukraine . now its crystal clear that he is capable of anything , and that article 5 and the nuclear umbrella are the only real guarantee against the presence of russian soldiers on ones land ."
7531,denmark an norway are nato . they have a policy to not allow us bases or nuclear missiles . finland and sweden when in nato will continue to not be escalating tensions .
7532,can putin just die already ?
7533,russia has threatened the entire world with nukes . they don't get to decide how countries prepare for further aggression from what's become a rogue nation .
7534,shut up vladmir
7535,russian propaganda for the low educated 
7536,"i dont want to hear what russia says anymore . they have lost our favor and spit in our face . if theyre about to declare war i will hear of it , otherwise ill be ignoring them . let them descent to tribalism and huts ."
7537,good thing that nato has no intention to place nukes in latvia or finland .
7538,our rockets can go around the earth multiple times and still hit putin right in the bussy . we don't need to move them closer .
7539,stop it guyzzzz im suuuup3rrr cereallll !!!
7540,was nato even interested in doing this ? pretty sure the usa is happy with its current ability to end all life on the planet from within our borders and ssbns .
7541,just die of cancer already ffs
7542,"nuclear missiles are already on their border at all times because it's not 1962 anymore . nuclear missiles are launched from submarines now , have been for 40 years . both sides have fully loaded subs patrolling each others coasts at all times . it's not in any way a secret or something they try to prevent each other from doing , it's just a fact of life . because of this any claim that russia doesn't want its neighbours to join nato "" because they'll put missiles on their border "" should be immediately recognizable to you as a lie . they don't want their neighbours to join nato because then they won't be able to invade them if they want to . simple as that ."
7543,bolt down the washing machines
7544,russia can cram it in their asshole .
7545,"putin is on his way out and he knows it . hes going to die anyway , so he doesnt care if a nuclear war starts , hes dead anyway , may as well kill as many as he can before he goes ."
7546,oh no russia threatens with nukes . never heard that one before .
7547,"what russia "" says "" or "" warns "" is moot , they've proven time and time again they can't be trusted . they are basically pathological liars and aggressive at that . the proper response here is for nato to do whatever the fuck they want to neutralize this aggressor once and for all ."
7548,says the county that took all of ukraines nukes promising to not do exactly what it's doing now . why should any county give a y fucks what this money loosing desperate dying despot says
7549,another day another useless pitiful threat from putin . its getting quite old now .
7550,russia issues an empty warning every day it seems .
7551,i say this on every post where russia threatens the west . fuck around and find out .
7552,i thought the whole point of nuclear missiles is you can keep them at a distance ??
7553,"what are they going to do , throw another battalion into the river ?"
7554,sorry vlad but if you keep threatening to use nuclear weapons what kind of response do you expect ? the problem with you keep warning nato is that they have no take it seriously now that your conventional military has had the myth of the unstoppable machine well and truly dismissed the only thing left to wave at us is the nuclear weapons card ..... so if you have your back to the wall and facing defeat and humiliation you just might prefer to see the world burn and push the button .. it would be stupid and irresponsible not to be prepared to retaliate .....
7555,"eh , i think out of all the crazy demands from russia in the past months this is a valid request and not a big deal . is not like nato can't already respond appropriately right now , so is not worth to escalate things with no real benefit ."
7556,stfu putin .
7557,"world needs a spam filter for all this "" russia warns "" bs"
7558,"same old shit , more frail dictator"
7559,russia is just posturing . they know the minute they use nuclear weapons their country and people will be wiped clean from planet earth . russia is like north korea 2.0 .
7560,its because of him we want to join what an idiot
7561,"russia warns ! mother fucker youre a war criminal , you are done !"
7562,"could they either get on with it already , or quit their sabre rattling ? i'm tryna plan a trip to europe , so i'd like to know if it'll still be there before i spend the money , and i don't think ' nuclear apocolypse ' is covered by any flight insurance"
7563,"nuclear war doesnt even scare me anymore . the threat of climate change is permanent and nuclear war is temporary and sparks a global winter that could restore the meting ice sheet and end global pollution . from a trolleybus problem perspective , the nuclear war might be less destructive than our own pollution that is destroying the world anyways"
7564,i doubt his nukes even work
7565,no one gives a shit about russias warnings anymore . they warn us 30 times a day about whatever stupid shit their tiny brains come up with . just because russians are stupid enough to listen to each other doesnt mean we are . go fuck your self russia .
7566,isn't he dying or something ? nobody can help speed that up ?
7567,russia needs to be isolated from the rest of world just like north korea . dont import from them and dont export to them . they want to be the bully they can play alone .
7568,"you failed . miserably , accept it ."
7569,"dear russians : no one takes you seriously or respects your joke of a "" military superpower ."" fix your leadership problem and the rest of the world will happily stop treating you like the neighborhood child molester ."
7570,what are they going to do ? move the nuclear weapons in kaliningrad closer ?
7571,"realistically , what is their response ? more missiles in the baltic ? kaliningrad already basically just exists to be a nuclear missile silo . who fucking cares what russia thinks anymore"
7572,"putin often warns how his ballistic { and ultra-ballistic and hyper-ballistic } nuclear missles can devastate berlin , paris , london in scant minutes { measured in seconds }. then he flips the narrative to warn he will not allow nukes to edge closer to russia's border , as if nato is not similarly armed . the contradiction made me realize , if a conflict goes nuclear , those few seconds do not matter . he knows how inefficient his conventional military is . it is highly trained nato conventional forces on his frontier that he fears . if nato rolls east , russia is almost defenseless { except for nukes }, and he knows it . edit add : more likely , if putin massed russian troops along its western frontier for a quick strike into the west , nato troops along that frontier could quickly establish air superiority and then use pre-positioned artillery and armor to decimate his conventional forces simply holding the line ."
7573,"yes , nato is the one with its nucs out waving it around like its the only thing it has going for it "
7574,"from nato with love : we will . because you invade ukraine , this is a reaction to your shitty behavior"
7575,"i can only be scared for so long dawg , eventually im gonna just hope for the best and ignore the threats ."
7576,"the problem with threatening to nuke is it isolates you completely . no country , friend or foe wants to be annihilated by putin being trigger happy . especially china . it's the reason all the "" stans "" normally friends of russia have suddenly backed away from putin like a 3rd grader that just shit his pants on the playground . they might be russian "" friendly "" until he threatens to wipe out all their families and countries as collateral damage in a nuclear war with the west ."
7577,why ? putin is the only guy who rules the world ? let sweden and finland join the nato . what consequences ? the military actions . that is the only reason both countries are joining nato .
7578,"you are the cause of this , directly . and once again , no one wants to attack your crappy country ."
7579,"unfortunately for putin he already played all his cards . russia already has nuclear weapons in kaliningrad and they signed a treaty with belarus to allow russia to place nuclear weapons in their territory . so i have no idea what his response would be , placing nuclear weapons right on natos border ?"
7580,russia it's either total annihilation of this planet or you knock this shit off . there's no world where you come out victorious .
7581,you practically border the us so i dont really think our nuclear forces could get much closer
7582,"russia was stopped by a country that was only supported by nato , if they ever went up against nato fully , they would be annihilated . as for russian nuclear forces , does anyone really think they are in any better condition than the rest of the russian military ??"
7583,fuck you putin fucking rat
7584,kaliningrad clearly already brought russian nuclear weapons to the nato border in the centre of the eu...or is this a one way discussion where only russia's opinion counts . apart from the point that a nato member ship does not automatically mean nuclear weapons .
7585,"er they have subs in the artic , atlantic , baltic and barent sea .."
7586,"yea yea keep on threatening you old bald fuck . the spell has been broken , everyone now knows youre basically the north korea of europe ; all talk and no walk ."
7587,isn't it true that russia has nuclear weapons in kaliningrad ? that is essentially the eastern boundary of nato . that's the closest you can get .
7588,can this little embarrassment just go die of his cancer quicker ? holy shit .
7589,"we can get you from here , thanks ."
7590,no one cares . nato will do what it wants
7591,"nato arent moving nukes dude , just trying to protect itself from invasion ."
7592,closer than they already are ? like another 10 seconds is going to make a difference when a nuclear bomb is sent from a place a few miles / kilometers closer ?
7593,the thing putin needs to understand is we don't f-ing care if we all die so long as we torture him to death for his war crimes ... his filthy z boys raped a 15 year old child for 10 days ... we r never going forgive that x
7594,"dude you were already going to put nato closer if ukraine was forced into the rf . youre just mad that more nato ended up on your border without your walmart brand army gaining any territory . piss off , putler ! ! "
7595,nato doesn't need any nuclear weapons . we just learned that russian soldier camp voluntarily in chernobyl .
7596,russia : warns of response rest of world : roflmao
7597,all bark no bite so far
7598,just another bluster for their masses . russia knows full well nato isn't about to place nuclear weapons in finland and sweden should they join nor do i think either of those countries would allow it since finland has made it clear it still wants a cordial relationship with russia after it joins nato . moscow at this point has to complain an act tough here since they want to hide the obvious slap in the face this is to russia's prestige due to the entire ukraine war being portrayed as them stopping nato expansion only to have this happen with not much they can do about it .
7599,for a long time these threats meant something to nato and returned results for russia . i think nato is over putin's threats . he is obviously trying to regain control of the situation and looking stupider and stupider by the day .
7600,"has nukes on kaliningrad , threatens about nuking nato cities every single day , whines about nato nuclear forces closer fck russia , fck putin , and fuck their entitled karen whining ."
7601,sounds like putin is scheisse posting .. making up crap .
7602,do it pussy
7603,russia needs to stfu . this is beyond tiresome . if he was going to do something he would have already .
7604,russia can go f *** itself
7605,"you see , heres the rub vladimir , the beauty of our nuclear weapons is we dont need to drive them up to your border to use them . in fact i know it sounds like sorcery but we can launch them from submarines or even the good ol us of a ."
7606,"the only fucking people threatening nuclear war is russia and north korea . nato simply says "" if you nuke us first , we will nuke you back ."" the usa knows exactly what the horrors of nuclear weapons are . 21 days before dropping one on japan , we exploded one on our own soil . no one but the king of idiots or the absolute most evil people in the world would actively want to see a nuclear weapon launched first . and the only way to prevent that is to ensure mutual destruction , since even the king of idiots and absolute most evil don't want to see their golf courses , boats , and palaces turned into irradiated ruins ."
7607,question : if sweden and finland join nato will russia even be able to provision kaliningrad ?
7608,whats old dude threatening now ? its like everyday blah blah blah nuke this and nuke that and just for fun nuclear tsunami . we get it you are now nk 2.0 and just say nuke so people think your important or something . go home russia and stay there
7609,"yep . after russia's collapse - kaliningrad will be most armed country in the world . tanks , cruise missiles , hypersonic missiles , nukes ..."
7610,haha like those ones would ever actually get airborne with that much anti-air surrounding them .
7611,russia trying to move closer to natos nuclear forces : do not move your nuclear forces closer to us .
7612,well you can but at that point its just straight up nuclear war
7613,> what are they gonna do ? they'll come kill your grandmother and steal toilets . that's what russia does .
7614,they might even move nukes into knigsberg where they already have nukes .
7615,"> "" it will be necessary to respond ... by taking adequate precautionary measures that would ensure the viability of deterrence ,"" interfax agency quoted grushko as saying . basically sounds like they're just going to move _their_ nuclear forces closer too or something ."
7616,"nah , lavrov will make us look at his ugly mug again so he can bark some trivial shit ."
7617,"you forgot to also include raping , kidnapping and torturing"
7618,putin we are invading georgia . but boss we already did that . no dumb asses the state of georgia
7619,maybe something like placing nukes in cuba . hmm ... i think i saw this movie before .
7620,"rape your infants , kill and eat your pets , torture boys and girls . there are a great many things to fear from a russian invasion , even if they lose ."
7621,i got bad news for russia : there is a us submarine in st . petersburg's harbor right now with a missile flight time of 30 seconds to the elimination of the top 100 targets of value in russia .
7622,"they will send vlad to take a shit in your bath tube . worst case , they will hire amber heard ."
7623,at some point this little man has to realize his threats arent working it just makes him look like the little bitch he is
7624,right ? dont need to move shit . its just whether or not you have a minute or two of warning .
7625,besides ballistic missile subs i'd be surprised if we've moved anything since they invaded ukraine . mad isn't about moving things around to be close enough with enough notice anymore .
7626,"he's just trash talking . he's going to complain that nato moved nukes closer even though they've been in the same spot this whole time . he's escalating in order to save face , which is stupid logic . he's going to bring the bar down so low that when he can finally hurdle over it , he can call it a win . way of the trump ."
7627,"of course they do . and 99 % is ment for internal consumption . he has to keep up his appearance of a strong and developed russia . ofc we know that is bullshit , but indoctrination can hit pretty hard ."
7628,it's like they never heard the story of the boy who cried wolf .
7629,from 0 to north korea in 3 months whats the fastest route from russia to north korea ? through ukraine .
7630,"nato won't move anything into finland . they're set . all finland and sweden joining nato means practically is them being part of article 5 . that includes having everyone being part of a shared command structure and doctrine , but they won't even need a new base ; it's all there already ."
7631,"i feel like he is attempting ' suicide by cop ' but with nato as the cop . if that fails , suicide by nuke ."
7632,amen
7633,"the tape they used to hold their gps onto the dash fell off . ussr issue duct tape , like at a dt , not the good shit ."
7634,they have done that always . it seems to be part of their foreign policy to go into other countries airspace . they know no one will have the balls to shoot down their planes
7635,lolololol
7636,is a ** russian ** proverb meaning a warning that carries no real consequences . ironic
7637,i mean if you move them closer you can in theory conduct a decapitating first strike of high speed low time of flight nuclear strikes that cripple retaliatory capabilities to where the us abm net can be of use and the country can live on minus 10-20 % of the pop . that being the - best case - of nuclear war .
7638,"> its what happens when you upkeep your equipment . this narrative needs to stop . there are mutual inspection treaties between the us and russia dating back to the early 1970s . biden and putin just signed the latest in 2021 , it's called new start . there are teams of americans in russia , right now , doing inspections . they report that there are over 4000 fully-capable icbms . per the treaty , that's the exact amount the us has . the two nations are equally capable on the nuclear front , it's part of the treaties that have been in place for 50 years . this was huge during the cold war , and now people have no idea . is the us more capable on other fronts ? surely . but nukes are another story . the only concern is if russia is hiding more ."
7639,this shit is meant for domestic audiences . russia needs an enemy their people can be frightening of or else they will realize their real enemy is the russian government .
7640,every day ... russia threatens x . : eyeroll :
7641,"but moving from "" finland and sweden must not join nato !"" to this means they've already accepted nato expansion !"
7642,"it was scary the first 25 times , now it's just par for the course without any action ."
7643,has putin seen the rental market in my area ? nuclear annihilation seems preferable to seeing my next lease agreement
7644,this is very off topic but i would google claire weekes if you want help . she's the gold standard for overcoming that kind of anxiety .
7645,its the free space on the 2022 bingo board
7646,"i'm no expert , but i'm pretty sure it does matter because of how much time you have to react to a potential nuclear missile launch , and how can you react ( the closer it is , the harder it is to try to shoot it down ). this is why when the us placed nukes in turkey right at russia's border , the soviets reacted by placing nukes in cuba next to the us ( and all the crisis that happened as a result of that )."
7647,i don't even wanna think about what he smells like .
7648,theres no way there already isnt at least a couple of ohio class nuclear submarines near russia right now .
7649,hes a barking lapdog with nukes . hes barking a lot but he is probably not going to bite . but he could . or he could launch nukes . its just that he is a lapdog .
7650,"yeah , the more vehemently the kremlin denies something the more you should believe in it ."
7651,why should we when we have nuclear armed submarines off the coast of russia . there's no need to make visible land targets when we already have stealth subs ready to go .
7652,sadly cold war nukes are still nukes but at this point who's taking russias statements seriously anymore officially
7653,that's a very good thing
7654,i think there's a narrow international shipping lane between them ?
7655,"nato prevents aggression , not peaceful shipping . i'm pretty sure there's no provisions to halt military shipments outside of war ."
7656,"> will russia even be able to provision kaliningrad ? it will not change the strategic postion for kaliningrad . russia must already send supply through nato countries over land , or by sea past the nato fleet . sweden and finand joining will not change it ."
7657,"this is the thing . pre war i was all "" ooh , russia are scary best not to provoke them "" now i'm just "" stfu russia """
7658,if they're threatening nukes they're hardly a stable superpower ... nothing about the russin leadership seems stable and they twist the truth and change their story every f***ing time they speak
7659,so like ukraine was after ussr fell ?
7660,oh no not my toilets
7661,"they won't steal your toilets , they'll just [ shit in your shower .]("
7662,"> steal toilets that's like a dog chasing cars , they wouldn't know what to do with one if they caught it ."
7663,they also steal underwear
7664,"* rape your grandmother seriously , theyve not just been killing them . fucking animals ."
7665,you wouldnt steal a toilet
7666,"i guess i'll just hijack this comment from all the possible top ones . as a finn , i just want to say that if finland becomes a nato member state , i hope that finnish nato membership will look similar to norway's in that , that there wont be any nuclear weapons in finland . i don't think that would serve nato alliance , either . it would create even more unnecessary tension . besides , with nukes , i'm sure there's some difference whether the distance is 250km or 1000 km , but i don't it would be make much difference at that point . finland is not joining nato to threaten anyone . that's why i truly hope our membership status will be like with norway's . our military is called * puolustusvoimat * \- a defensive force - much like with japan's - it's not meant for invasion , but defense . ( and guess defense what for , lolz ) at times like these , while i really , really would like all the russian aggression to stop , i do understand the point that they don't want nukes any closer than there is . ** and i actually sincerely think that's the only reasonable thing kremlin can ask for . really .** i'd be really happy , that in 2-5 years from now on , we somehow move on this - and the stance of russia would be - "" okay fine finland , be in nato then - but no nukes ! only we can haz nukes on the border !!!"" - and that's that . i can live with russian threat , like finns have always lived with , as long as it stays only as that . we aren't as insecure as russia is . tl,dr : if finland gets to nato , i hope there wont be nukes stationed in finland . that wouldn't do any good for the now - forgotten utopia of "" world peace "". it wouldn't serve anyone to start pushing these weapons constantly closer and closer to each other ."
7667,hide your potatos .
7668,they still have to go through poland and germany so i'm probb safe
7669,"> they'll come kill your grandmother and steal toilets . i read this as "" steal tortillas "" at first . "
7670,they will come rape your grandma and steal toilets .
7671,and put a mine in her washer .
7672,say goodbye to your dishwasher toaster and sink
7673,whether intentional or not theyve been * trading * peoples toilets for fresh russian tanks ! how generous of them
7674,.... toilet paper too
7675,oh nooo not again .
7676,pfff nato counters by sending a battalion of farm tractors . checkmate bitches !
7677,"if russia accuses or threatens anyone , it's because they're about to do it or have already done it ."

7682,"russia invading anywhere in the south where there are more guns than people , tons of brush/terrain to hide ,& dangerous wildlife right before the start of summer and near triple digit temperatures sounds so dumb i think he might try it * spoiler * he wouldnt get past i-95 and damn sure wouldnt get past the mountains"
7683,x-men : first class ?
7684,cuba is probably happy with their current level of freedom and democracy and isnt looking to have more .
7685,not really . look at the distance from berlin to kaliningrad's nukes . edit : it's around a 1 minute warning . do you get the difference ?
7686,the launch would be detected very early . it's the specific target that you'd have very little warning for .
7687,depends on how good russias defense systems are ? smaller budget by at least 5 times
7688,with how russia is doing we could launch icbms from the moon and they would still tell putin nothing is happening ...
7689,ehh nato has actually deployed a lot more nuclear capable bombers to eastern europe since this all started . first strike isn't a dead idea it still is important to be able to threaten hitting nuclear launch sites with missiles before they other guy can launch his missiles . perhaps more importantly it makes dictators like putin worry they wont reach the bunker in time so that alone makes first strike capability very important to threaten with . doubly so as recent event have proven russian air defense radar isnt exactly the best .
7690,"yea , basically can guarantee that there are plenty of us ballistic missile subs within striking distance . they're certainly already aware of that but are just trying to posture ."
7691,it's almost like there's a connection
7692,"i've been working on cool poses i can pick , so when i get vaporized it leaves a funny shadow that future generations \* can chuckle over . \* or cockroaches , you know , whatever's left"
7693,just let poland off-leash and everything else will solve itself .
7694,poland hungers for russian conscripts
7695,"nato might move some missiles and artillery shells and other such things to finland , but they would be launched by the finnish defense forces . this is basically what finland needs nato for ."
7696,"i kinda feel like maybe hes trying to goad nato into joining the fight so he can withdraw his forces after a defeat and be like , see it took all of nato to beat strong russian army! to save some amount of face ."
7697,"i'd be ok with "" suicide by shot in the back of the head 6 times , reloads and shoots himself 6 more times """
7698,"somebody call nato and tell them that putin is having a mental health crisis , thatll speed things along"
7699,it would be much better if he were taken out by the oligarchy . how many of them are gonna suicide out before putin gets his turn ?
7700,"and that's exactly why both sweden and finland have gone from "" no way we're joining nato "" to "" nato doesn't seem so bad anymore . and then the invasion of ukraine drove the final nail and now both of us really want to join nato ."
7701,"wow , til . i'm gonna use that phrase whenever i can now ."
7702,"sub exist . ( us french uk ) all deployed , decapitating strike is just a fantasy book nowadays ."
7703,how about the nuclear subs ?
7704,"except there are nuclear submarines , [ mobile icmbs ]( constantly moving here and there all across russia , infamous [' dead hand ']( mad system and who the f knows what else . even if one somehow manages to disable this ' dead hand ' ( if it exists ), it will be almost impossible to eliminate all the mobile icbms and submarines . meaning there will be inevitable retaliatory strikes . and if there's something even remotely fast as kinzhal or [ this fast af thing ]( but for offensive purposes , i doubt that it is possible to catch them all . good that us military is probably more aware about this topic than average redditor in this sub ."
7705,"pretty weird how the general vibe of this new cold war is "" go ahead , launch them , get it over with , i don't give a fuck anymore """
7706,"i saw a comment a while back , everyone is just a little passively suicidal recently ."
7707,"i honestly don't know the answer to this : if an armed nuclear missile is shot down while in the air , is the nuclear warhead detonated ?"
7708,"my grandfather was stationed at that base in turkey lol , he was sweating through the cuban missile crisis knowing he was chilling in probably the first place russia would strike ."
7709,"honestly it doesn't matter where nukes are placed . the reality is that neither russia or the us could launch a first strike able to entirely destroy the others arsenal before they get enough off to end the world . the idea of a missile shield works against only a few missiles at most ( as they have multiple warheads ), it's more for rogue states like north korea than fully nuclear capable ones ."
7710,"short and intermediate range missiles on neighboring territory and missile defense shield systems make it matter . the intermediate range missiles are first strike weapons meant to destroy most of the enemies ' missiles , then the missile defense will intercept the remaining second strike ( retaliatory ) missiles . it will mean that russia no longer has a reliable second strike option ."
7711,"( based on what ive read ) its pretty much impossible to shoot down a icbm once its gone ballistic , so the best shot you have is just after launch . the problem is the response time . launched from for example finland russia would probably only have a few seconds figuring out if it was legit and respond or not . then again i dont think finland or sweden have any wish for nuclear weapons on their soil so its a pointless threat . also estonia lithuania and latvia are all closer to moscow and they dont have nukes ."
7712,"it doesnt matter at all . both russia and the us have hundreds of icbms and neither can defend themselves 100 % from all of them . its not like someone will shoot single nuke from finland and thats it , if mad is triggered , hundreds if not thousands of nukes will fly simultaneously and neither of them will be able to stop them . it really doesnt matter if theres few nukes placed in 10km from russian border vs hundreds of nukes 3000 miles away . its called mad for a reason . russia only have to worry about ground troops and tanks when it comes to bordering with nato , and this kind of conflict is absurd when it comes to two nuclear powers . they are just using nato as propaganda fuel to tell their own citizens why they had to invade their neighbors ."
7713,"vodka , borscht , cheap cologne , and failure ."
7714,the clown stinks of vodka and cancer . thank fuck for the latter . maybe there is a god after all .
7715,you have to get past finland and estonia for that
7716,commercial shipping for sure ( even though most such companies have ceased russian operations ) but countries take their sovereignty seriously . can't imagine any country would be comfortable with a demonstrably belligerent nation to move anything close to operational through their territory .
7717,"this is my sentiment exactly . when you make a conditional threat like dont join nato or well attack you then attack anyway , your threats no longer mean anything . plus , with how well ukraine is defending itself despite being under-manned and under-resourced , russia now sounds like the schoolyard bully who is indignant or crying that their target is fighting back . like you said , russia can just stfu at this point"
7718,"yeah they pulled the nuke card and everyone just went "" they're threatening nukes now , so if we give in when are they threatening nukes next and will we give in again then ? when does it stop ?"" so everyone just kinda went deaf to it ."
7719,"my entire youth we were taught russia was not quite on par with us , but could pose difficulties in the event of all out war . honestly they had the wool over our eyes . they really showed their hand with ukraine . they came hard , and was holding a doyle bronson ."
7720,same . after all these years of media hype and so many movies and video games making russia seem like a premiere military power i used to be scared of them as well . now i think of them like north korea . a lot of empty threats in a folly attempt to look powerful
7721,we've all discovered the emperor has no clothes . now putin looks pathetic trying to stay relevant .
7722,"after this , not only does the russian government have to change but nukes need to be dismantled and their tech to make them eliminated ."
7723,"yes , so let's "" reduce "" nuclear proliferation by "" protecting "" kaliningrad if it returns its arms to "" responsible "" russia ."
7724,say goodbye to your toaster and dishwasher as well .
7725,make sure they are not flushed lol
7726,"priorities , people . this guy gets it ."
7727,they would take a look at my toilet and surrender .
7728,"to be fair , they need them . they dont have nice ones where they come from"
7729,huehuehuehue twirls mustache while caressing your toilet
7730,reminds me of memoirs of the khmer rouge walking out of the brush and into phenom penh ; and the slack-jawed rural folk were pooping in living rooms ! nice to see that history still provides us with an ample amount of cave folk .
7731,"but its okay , they will leave their instagram [ handle ]( so you can follow them ."

7735,you wouldnt steal a child
7736,you wouldn't shit in the toilet and give it back to the grieving victim...and then steal it again !
7737,"i don't think nato is interested in utilizing finland for that . but right now , nothing the kremlin asks is reasonable because russia is the aggressor . everything done here , including joining nato , is done as a defensive response . when you're the aggressor , you don't get to ask for "" reasonable concessions "" from the people defending themselves from you , and it's important to keep that in perspective . if finland had decided to join nato while russia was minding its own business , it would be perfectly reasonable for russia to not want finland to host nukes . but because russia has literally driven finland into nato's arms while trying to genocide ukraine , russia doesn't get to ask anything . that doesn't mean i think finland should host nukes . but i am telling you to stop viewing anything the kremlin asks for as "" reasonable "". everything the kremlin asks for is designed to give russia the room to maneuver militarily into its neighbor's lands , it's not a matter of reasonable self-defense . if they cared about reasonable self-defense , they wouldn't have invaded ukraine or driven finland into nato in the first place . nato isn't looking to start a nuke war with russia . nato is a defensive pact , and it's explicitly designed to * not * allow itself to be used for aggression -- for example , if you're a member of nato and initiate conflict with another country , the rest of nato is not obligated to assist you even if the other country attacks back . your post seems to indicate you think that nato is an aggressor and that you want finland's membership to be special and comparatively "" not "" aggressive , but nato is not and has never been an aggressor , and its membership obligations are designed to prevent the alliance from being used that way . the european countries that allegedly ( i say "" allegedly "" because nato has never confirmed ) host nato nukes are not aggressors , either . they are belgium , germany , italy , the netherlands and turkey . again , it's unlikely finland would be asked to host nukes . but if they were , they'd be hosting them for the same reason we used to dig moats around a castle and fill them with sharpened pit-spikes . and it would be because we're trying to leverage russia into backing off , not because we want to initiate a nuclear war with them ."
7738,"i hope for that too , but russia has no capacity to influence that . look at how they unilaterally stationed nukes in belarus and in kaliningrad ( in secret , lol )."
7739,"if finland joins nato i think they should be forced to produce more of my favorite hockey players , sahti , frazers , and salmiakki for all the other nato countries ."
7740,with the us capability of icbm and slbm strikes there doesn't need to be nuclear missiles permanently housed within any part of scandinavia and russia is well aware of this . at least they should be if their intelligence is worth a damn . i suspect this is nothing more than saber rattling from russia in the hope that empty threats will somehow dissuade sweden and finland from joining nato . it feels more and more like flimsy threats are the only tool that they have considering the lackluster performance thus far against the inferior military force that ukraine possessed at the beginning of this shit show . admittedly the tide has been turned through continuous assistance in the form of modern military equipment from many nato countries .
7741,"if russia(really , specifically putin ) didn't want nukes coming closer , then they(putin ) shouldn't have started shit ."
7742,"russia disarmed ukraine of nukes by promising it wouldn't ever be hostile towards it . fast forward to today and you can see what happened . russians can never be trusted , they are and always will be the scum of the earth . just ask any country that was invaded by russia in ww1 or 2 . it's copy paste like what happens in ukraine ."
7743,"w*tf ?* ""* we are not joining nato to become an aggressor ourselves .*"" no country joins nato to become an aggressor country . it's a defensive pact . don't worry about nukes in finland , you probably won't be told either way . disposition of assets isn't usually divulged . if that's a deal-breaker for you , petition your government to stay out of nato . when the russians come knocking on your door , finland can fight russia alone , like ukraine ."
7744,"honestly , i don't think that there's any advantage for the us to station nukes in finland . yeah , shorter travel time , but the us already has a massive , modern , and well maintained nuclear force that can scour life off the face of the earth . i would be happy to not station nukes in finland , and i think that nato isn't going to prioritize that . the biggest advantage to having that massive border is to just tie down russian troops making them unavailable for deployment elsewhere , anything that creates an excuse to nuke the border and pull russian forces away undercuts that primary advantage ."
7745,"nato has never needed finland for that , it's not like there aren't already nato members bordering russia and to be honest most of the european based nukes are on subs anyway . the us may very well ask to put missile defence systems/early warning in finland like they did in poland though"
7746,ukraine gave up their nuclear weapons and now russia is murdering their people . russia wouldn't have invaded if they still had nuclear weapons .
7747,"the usa presumably has one or more nuclear-armed submarines sitting on the bottom of the baltic sea at this very moment . would having land-based nukes in finland even represent any real advantage , or would it just be provocation for no reason ?"
7748,"yeah i dont think finland is going to suddenly want to become a nuclear power - half the reason for joining is to be protected by several established nuclear powers , at least in my mind . putin is whining for his fans at home , and youre right , theres no practical need to deploy nuclear weapons close to russian territory ; the us could glass them several times over in half an hour or so from the other side of the planet ( thankfully no one wants that to happen )."
7749,"sounds like a modern day republican as well , tbh ."
7750,i don't want to see a nuclear kiss in my lifetime . 50 more years !
7751,touch tips .
7752,"russia ain't exactly asking , if you know what they mean"
7753,"also why germany has allowed for the continued deployment of strategic nuclear missiles in their country from the us , any sign of those missiles even being prepared to be fired at them will immediately cause those missiles in germany to fly towards russia...pretty much mad is still at play here ."
7754,"if russia launched 1 missile , they would track it till it landed to decide the appropriate response . if russia launched 500 missile , the response would be immediate and devastating . either way it makes no difference near or far . there is no escaping the consequences unless you moved into bunkers before launching ."
7755,"really ? very interesting to think about that . i'd assume the entire country would be on high alert , of course"
7756,"honestly , if we've learned anything about the russian defense budget , it's as if a flock of vultures are gnawing at the bone to spend on italian villas and shiny yachts . hardly sustainable ."
7757,"> nuclear capable bombers the iskander missiles that russia is ** firing at ukriane today ** are "" nuclear capable ""."
7758,"staying true to my word i'm surprised , but it does make sense given what russia has shown of their military capabilities ."
7759,nato has never deployed any nuclear capable bombers to eastern europe . the recent deployment of b-52's was to the uk .
7760,"on the other hand , most fighter-bombers are nuclear capable , so that's not really all that exciting . the german tornado is nuclear capable , as is the french rafale , but they're also fighter aircraft ."
7761,i've always hated the idea of a first strike .
7762,"to my understanding , all us ballistic subs patrol within striking distance of their targets . thats kinda their role ."
7763,i'm pretty sure it's like a 5 minute trip from turkey to moscow . so they don't really need to be closer .
7764,really has changed my opinion on us geopolitics
7765,i was thinking about posing next to a dinosaur skeleton in an attack pose so when whatever is left finds my scorched shadow theyll be like this dude was attacked by a dinosaur skeletonwhat the hell happened in the 20s?!

7769,"man , bro , you made my fucking week . i haven't laughed so hard in so long ."
7770,"the ultimate hand-puppetry , but with your whole body ."
7771,"finland already has the biggest artillery force in europe after russia , though . air superiority and more robust supply infrastructure would be a welcome addition , though ."
7772,"putin would never let his pride take such a blow . the strong man attitude is way too real . at the same time he also needs to survive this , so any type of withdrawal that makes him look weak could cost him his life ."
7773,"all of nato ... pfft . if ukraine can push russia back , finland alone would be more than enough to take them ."
7774,lol same til ! interesting learning origin of phrases
7775,also ground based nuclear silos are usually hardened against nuclear strikes . even if you could wipe out us/uk/france etc those missiles are still coming for you .
7776,i'd be willing to bet their second-strike capabilities aren't exactly up to snuff based on what we've seen so far . russia doesn't seem to have the will nor the capital for upkeep and maintenance .
7777,would be doing us a favor really
7778,"there are two places i'd rather be in case of a nuclear detonation . either someplace far away or in the instantaneous blast zone . you'd cease to exist before you realized what happened , your pain receptors are not fast enough for the light speed explosion . the worst place to be is far enough from the immediate blast zone , but not far enough from the shockwave , the radioactive fallout , and the abject ruin and destruction of anything resembling order . you may have minutes or hours to live , in horrible agony , from acute radiation poisoning . that is if you're not buried under rubble , on fire , maimed or impaled . no help is coming . not because the local government is scrambling , or resources are scarce but sending help would pose a significant danger to anyone not already caught at ground zero . besides , practically speaking , anyone caught in the zone that survived the initial blast would not be worth saving , radiation will make sure of that ."
7779,"not suicidal , just not as bummed about an unforeseen , untimely end . like , yeah i want to live , but if i die , but i wont have to deal with the bs the world is going through. im not personally that far yet , i mostly like where im at , but i fully get it ."
7780,"it's cause we're in the midst of a technological revolution that is rapidly devaluing human life with most leaders either being incompetent to manage the coming societal shifts or actively moving their respective population backwards . a lot of people simply don't have a place where they feel they belong , have purpose , or have stability in this world . so while not worth being actively suicidal about , you're absolutely right about it being a "" passively suicidal "" feeling . an indifference to living when it is a struggle to find a purpose to continue living ."
7781,"no nukes need to detonate in a very specific pattern to cause a fission chain reaction . they can still be very dirty radiation bombs though if shot down above a city . the chances of stopping a nuclear strike are very slim ( unless the us have some uber secret amazing defense tech that no one knows about ). it's impossible to shoot in the early stages because you'd have to be in very short range when it's launched ( most likely in russia ) and that time window is absolutely tiny (~ 2min ). this is why all states announce to governments that they are testing their nuclear launch systems ( russia & china ) even to their enemies during wartime . you could shoot it in mid-flight but that is also very , very difficult . you have like ~ 20 minutes ( i think ) to shoot it down and it releases decoys . one icbm has something like 40 decoys and 10 warheads . by that point , the defense systems have to correctly identify the real warheads quickly and then hit them dead on with interceptors that have something like 70 % chance of hitting . you'd have to shoot four interceptors at 1 warhead just to be sure and have the chances be 99 %. and there certainly are not enough interceptors for so many warheads . not to mention the 526 other icbms that could launch from anywhere or the hypersonic nuclear rockets ."
7782,no
7783,"could be worse . if you're in the last place they strike , you just get to find out the world is ending before you die in nuclear fire ."
7784,"check / r/buttpeels ' s comment above , he explains it well , as far as i can tell , why this would change the current balance ."
7785,"that would mean it doesn't matter if russia escalates nuclear presence at the us border . somehow , i doubt us would just shrug it off . ( to be clear , i'm not saying they would do this . i'm just making a point : p )"
7786,don't forget cancer
7787,"no , there are international waters between finland and estonia ."
7788,"no , you do not"

7797,""" look ! those guys are building a castle with a moat and pit-spikes ! why do they feel the need for such a deffensive structure ? they're threatening us ! let's attack them !"""
7798,"i dont think that was the point , i doubt nato was seriously discussing moving nuclear assets to finland , however if they dont putin can claim that russia was able to push nato from spreading nukes to their border ."
7799,every finnish citizen will be required to produce one ( 1 ) black metal or folk metal album
7800,hey i'm all about that if it means there's another pekka rinne and juuse saros . my hockey team has a great history of finnish excellence .
7801,"yeah , short of nuking finland , what can russia do ? their army is engaged in ukraine , what consequences are they going to face ? are they going to strap putin to the remaining horse and give him an empty gun and send him over the border ?"
7802,that's because russian money lines the pockets of modern day republicans .
7803,its no surprise that so many republicans are pro-russia .
7804,"or in anyone's life time , the loss of life a nuclear war can cause is unfathomable"
7805,"oh i know , but i suspect you didnt know what i meant"
7806,i honestly doubt russia could forcibly make cuba do anything lol
7807,i think you fail to understand how the original cuba incident occured
7808,"good , russia needs to fear nobody but the worth of its own insane threats ."
7809,"if putin was going to launch , the fucker would be in a bunker already . but i also presume informants would alert nato as it was happening ."
7810,now i wonder what the magic number for immediate response would be ? and i pray we don't find out .
7811,"the advantage of being close is that taking out an icbm in the silo or in its ascent phase is most reliable way to do it , that we know of publicly . that's why it scares them , getting first strike and interception missiles closer to russia's silos threatens the mutually assured part of mad . alas , they can't openly complain about us lessening the reliability of them committing nuclear genocide on us so , they frame it as us getting an offensive advantage , when it's really not . at least , not in terms of icbms ."
7812,"based on what we know that's definitely true . i often wonder what we don't know . what i mean is the aegis system and multiple classified military satellites . i'm not wearing a tinfoil hat or suggesting the us has secret space artillery . i'm just wondering , how much more capable is the us military of defending than we know ? how fast can we mark launch ? how predictable is icbm trajectory tracking ? obviously , you can only estimate the direction because the warhead redirects on second stage release , but maybe stop the icbm or be ready for the release stage ? lastly , what ability do they have to disable or destroy tracked missiles ? obviously they have short range systems with reasonable success . of course icbms are much faster , farther and have additional complications . i'm just wondering what the military has developed in secret for that type of situation . advanced lasers to malfunction missiles ? always ready defense ships with aegis ? 5th gen fighter jets or bomber drones with missile defenses ? may not be much , but knowing the us military it's not nothing . all just speculation but the military is known for being years ahead of what we know and developing solutions to problems we didnt know we had . i'd prefer to continue not knowing if the alternative is finding out when they activate defenses ."
7813,if they launch one there's also a ** much ** higher likelihood of being able to viably intercept it .
7814,"not a chance , one r-36m icbm has 10 re-entry vehicles . no way is the us , uk or france just going to sit back and see which 10 cities get nuked ."
7815,now imagine your a fucking narcissist who is about to die anyway .
7816,"gotta shoot a decoy missle so the primary one doesn't get shot down . and the decoy should pop out a flag that says "" boom !"""
7817,boring fact of the day .. the uk has a 72 hour ' cooling off period ' enshrined into law before we can legally send any nuclear retaliation if nuke(s ) hit us . all our nukes are sub-based so can't be taken out .
7818,"in america we get liek 40 minutes notice if russia launches , so real life like 15-20 minutes after you find out hopefully . wont have time to get anywhere . will just have to take cover and hope youre out of the initial blast , maybe there will be enough stone in the way for you to live ."
7819,"another thing is that not all nukes are missiles . russia is far more likely ( but still extremely unlikely ) to use nukes on ukraine than on a nuclear power . dropping a bomb from a plane would be much more subtle than launching a missile . for what it's worth , the white house has talked through what to do in case of such a situation , and the consensus seems to be , "" the pretense of just sending weapons is off . the us would send the full might of its conventional forces , air , sea , and land "" if that happened . but it won't happen , because it goes against stated russian nuclear doctrine . russia is all bluster , and that's an intentional strategy . russia can't retreat because of ukraine , but they could retreat from a united nato ."
7820,"as far as im aware all known launch sites are closely monitored , so we would know very quickly , but you cant do much other than respond with your own launches . even if you had say , 24 hours warning a nuke is going to hit new york city or something what can you do ? the number of people that successfully evacuate is going to be a small fraction of the people who cant because of panicking . in reality youd have much less warning too . thats just for known sites too , potentially there are say nuke carrying subs much closer than any icbm sites leading to strikes that arrive in a fraction of the time ."
7821,yes but those don't threaten the us .
7822,"all modern us jets can carry nuclear payloads , including f18 , f35 , f22 , etc ."
7823,that whole nuclear war thing does seem to be a bit of a bad idea

7831,"silo's are not able to withstand a direct hit by a nuclear weapon . ground based nuclear missile silos such as the ones used by the u.s . for the minuteman icbm's are built to withstand pressures of up to 2,000psi . this pressure is exceeded at a range of 300 meters from a 500kt nuclear blast . accuracy is key , but modern icbms and rvs are capable of delivering a warhead within these constraints . older military doctrine when weapons accuracy was worse would call for multiple warheads targeting a single silo to account for the probable circular error ."
7832,"as others are getting to , there is no winning a nuclear war . first off , the us icbm's are in the upper midwest . russia can't get to them without the us having a ton of notice and even if the government was gone , there is a clear chain of authority that would allow the military to launch . the same thing goes for russia . then you have subs anyway . its really not even possible in theory . the whole system has been designed around preventing your hypothetical ."
7833,"there were and still are worries that a russian first strike would be carried out by commercial container ships loaded with a thermonuclear bomb each to detonate simultaneously when they dock inside us harbors . it doesn't really matter though , even if they whole command chain would be destroyed , the submarines will interpret the lack of communication from us command as an indicator that a nuclear first strike hit the us and will launch regardless . it's one of the options believed to be specified in the ["" letters of last resort ""]( for the british submarines ."
7834,"nope , they dont all exist at one time , in one place for a reason . also , moscow is closer to strike from missiles located in europe , than dc is to moscow . unless i am mistaken . not to mention , you cant hit subs . we have(if memory serves correctly ) 16 boomer subs , a handful of cruise missile subs , and like 60 attack subs , i think . depending what happens . the next time those subs surface , its lights out . theres no crippling of the boomer subs , which have independent orders incase of this exact attack . those subs account for over half of the us nuclear arsenal alone . so no matter what strike is done , over half of the potential strikes are plunking around in the ocean . paired with whats flying in the air , no , there is no hope of a first strike war winning strike because all theyve done is potentially neutralize our silo based munitions and some part of the chain of command , never all of it . theres an order of operations and people trained on this exact scenario . the first person whos alive that they contact is told millions of americans dead , russia hit us. their first response is gonna be the same as any and everyone elses in the us : retaliate. there is only the first strike capability . there is no winning capability . edit : stupidly forgot russia has subs , which has been addressed already , but doesnt change the overall point in the slightest ."

7849,"i would not put it past them . thats besides the fact that they ( kaliningrad ) would rely mostly on trade from the north sea anyway , should estonia and finland decide to block off st petersburg . denmark basically controls of the access into the baltic , so nato could cut that entire portion of russia off"

7868,"2 , one is a potential mistake . 2 is an intention to start a nuclear war ."
7869,"it's probably not as high as you'd think . 1 you might be able to rationalize as a fuck up of unimaginable proportions , 2-5 or so if the country's in an active war you might be able to rationalize as a limited tactical strike , but more than that or if their trajectory overshoots the major front ( or if there's no war at all ) then it's all in . you don't launch 10 or 50 nukes as an opening salvo unless you're going all in . the most that has ever been used at a time is 1 , with a couple day wait before the next one . most tactical strikes are probably going to follow the same model - one initial strike , probably deliberately aimed at a less damage area to get everyone's attention , follow up with one more at a time to show you mean business , then maybe a mass strike . you probably don't even need 10 to decisively win a traditional war with how destructive a modern warhead is . unless you cunningly put a whole city's distance between every major force in your army you're losing most of your army to 10 strikes . if it's above 5 or so as a lead off you have to assume they're going all in and respond in kind ."
7870,"if you're interested in this , or nuclear weapons and their history , you should read this book :"
7871,"a response would be immediate regardless , but the the type and scale of the response that would differ depending on what was attacked and how many nukes were launched . a single nuke would likely garner a single nuke in return against whatever base launched it . if the enemy launched only a few icbms , the response would likely be a [ counterforce ]( strike of a similar size against silos and military installations . depending on what the enemy's targets are , a limited [ countervalue ]( strike against industrial or military manufacturing facilities is possible . the idea being to retaliate and deal enough damage to end the war without escalating to a full-scale exchange . a full-scale first strike on the us with hundreds of icbms would result in a massive retaliatory strike , with a large portion of it likely to be of the countervalue kind ."
7872,"except the mutual part is upheld even if somehow a successful first strike occurred against all your silo based based icbm's without them launching , because balistic missile submarines and road mobile icbm's exist , which would be impossible to eliminate or track simultaneously before they could retaliate . these platforms exist in the first place because they are less vulnerable and much more survivable , and pretty much render first strike capabilities moot ."
7873,could thaad stationed around russia potentially detect and stop icbms during launch ? or are they going too fast ?
7874,"if the us does have space artillery , or rods from god , then they could obliterate most nuclear silo's without any chance of russia to do anything . there would be no warning , just the sounds of explosions as the entire silo disappeared ."
7875,"even that depends on the type of missile , where it was launched from , and where it is heading . its very unlikely we would be able to intercept during stage 1 , which is like launch to low earth orbit . youd have to be very close to the missile , or have a warning that it was about to be launched . intercepting mid-flight would be challenging too because of the speed , youd need equipment along the pathway to accurately track it to guide the interceptor . and intercepting during the re-entry phase is almost impossible to intercept every weapon , because each missile carries multiple independent warheads . each warhead can have the same or different targets , and these dont even need controlled flight to completely fuck up wherever theyre going to land . theyre basically just falling debris , so infrared tracking is difficult , making intercepting more technology dependent and failure prone ."
7876,this is the answer . between corruption and ineptitude and our intercept ability there is a real possibility that if russia launched a strike it would end their ability to claim a deterrent because the launch would likely fail . once it has failed the deterrent effect is over and russia is a poor backwater of no particular import . so the current truth is that russia cant put itself in the position of having to prove its deterrent is effective because the result might be to prove the do not have a deterrent .
7877,of course not that is why mad exists . no one is going to wait and be like : oh they just nuked this city and that they will ignore it . only an actual fool would think that .
7878,keeps me up at night knowing how precarious the situation is
7879,just home you have a basement and get some water jugs in the basement to survive for like two weeks .
7880,tfw your home town is a tactical nuclear target
7881,only short-range free-fall ones . and the only jets that nato have deployed to eastern europe are small fighter-bombers with short ranges . none of the fighter jets deployed to countries in eastern europe have been seen carrying b-61's . which they would have if they were carrying them . also by that logic every large cargo plane the us has * could * in theory launch a nuclear weapon . but nobody is acting like sending cargo flights to poland was the us upping it's nuclear posture .
7882,thats true but they are limited to tactical nukes . bombers are still needed for something like the b83 which i think the other person was thinking about .
7883,sure but either side becoming confident enough to believe that they could pull off a successful first strike has always concerned me . i mean this is why we have nearly a dozen ssbn subs on patrol at all times .

7892,bloke was having a wank . nice .
7893,"> no blast door will stop a nearby nuke i don't think that's necessarily true . obviously a direct hit would basically melt or vapourize a spherical chunk of earth directly around the ground zero , but most nukes are set to be airburst weapons to cause as much damage to infrastructure around them as possible . however , the actual effect on reinforced , nuke-hardened structures may be smaller than you think . there's the famous example of a centurion tank being left about half a kilometre from a 9.1 kiloton nuclear bomb test ( which , granted , is small even for a tactical nuke these days ). but the only things wrong with the tank was that the antennae were ripped off , optics were abraded , and the mantlet cover cloth was burned off , but other than that the tank had just ran out of fuel and turned off . that said , if the tank had been crewed , the speculation is that the people inside probably would've been killed by the shockwave - but then again - it's a lot easier to reinforce a bunker or a missile silo , than a tank ."
7894,"it used to be that there were more silos than missiles/warheads , and they kept moving them around so an attacker would have to guess where they happened to be at any given moment , making them waste missiles on busting empty silos when they guessed wrong . nowadays , early warning and anti-missile systems could be enough to reduce the number of impacts so most of the silos would stay operational ."
7895,not just accuracy . nukes require maintenance . not shit a russian conscript can do . the charges require maintenance . most of russias nukes wont work . well probably all be staking our lives on it anyway .

7932,depends on their trajectory . if they're headed into the ocean i'd say it'd be written off as an irresponsible threat . although no way to know for sure what the protocol for this would be without being inside respective governments .
7933,"i wouldn't be so sure . 1 or 2 could be nuts , the idea that you can fire a few strikes with the idea that any reprisal would spark nuclear war . like if it was obvious the targets weren't us soil , i doubt the us would risk nuclear war to retaliate with nukes themselves ."
7934,well russia definitely isn't going to be using icbm's to hit ukraine . so there's a pretty good chance if they launch an icbm they're getting an instant response .
7935,"modern tactical warheads , and even legacy tactical weapons , are low yield . you'll need far more than ten to lose most of your army . that's why russia and the us had tens of thousands of weapons . most were threatre weapons not strategic ."
7936,"true , i would think that's why russia has been putting nearly all their newer generation icbms on mobile platforms , it must give them better odds at avoiding interception . but , i doubt it's a complete solution for them . mobile systems and nuclear subs have been around for decades and yet both sides have still openly put huge emphasis on securing allies to host missiles and defence systems ( see : cuba , turkey , ukraine , the baltic states , korea ). proximity and first strike capability has always been a huge part of nuclear strategy for a reason . nuclear subs are likely still the retaliatory trump card , given that both the uk and france have moved to rely on them almost exclusively . but , russia also lacks warm water ports that can access the big oceans in the winter without passing through nato controlled chokepoints . they're effectively surrounded navally and can't risk relying on them alone . so yes sure , mad still exists . but every time nato achieves its objectives they chip away at it . that is their absolute number one strategic goal after all . and year by year , [ nato gets more capable ]( the threat of that is why an economically struggling russia has been investing huge in developing and parading about technologies such as the avangard hypersonic glide vehicle and the rs-28 sarmat icbm which is supposedly designed to have a shorter boost phase so that it is more difficult to intercept , and partly why they felt pressured to secure a buffer zone through both puppeting belarus and doing such a reckless and expensive a thing as invading ukraine . we don't have the intel to see the nuclear arms race as the pentagon and kremlin do , but we can get a picture by looking at russia's actions and i think it's pretty clear . they are very concerned about the nato missile defence system ."
7937,"i'm just saying that it's a ** hell of a lot more likely ** when there's only \* one \* to worry about . you can throw everything at it . when there's a dozen ? two dozen ? two hundred ? gonna be a lot harder at that point . unfortunately , this is also what makes it more likely that any nation which launches a nuclear weapon will likely launch multiple ."

7942,"theres nuke shelters at my job from the cold war era . the walls are 3 thick poured concrete , it goes about 3 stories underground to the bottom part . the walls have 1 rebar every 3 both vertically and horizontally and in depth layered all through the the structure , meaning every square foot of concrete would have 18 pieces of rebar going through it and the rebar is all welded together lol . its damn near indestructible . we had to get some buildings demolished and they needed massive equipment and a lot of time to chip and cut away at it all . wrecking balls got stuck ."
7943,and thats the ones we know about
7944,"if you use a nuke as an aggression tool , you're telling everyone that rules don't apply anymore . people don't appreciate that , especially when they feel threatened by you and they have nukes too ."
7945,it'll escalate things for sure
7946,"ah , you right , did not think of their nuclear subs when saying that ."
7947,"russian nuclear submarines don't operate off the us coast . they operate in a location referred to as ' the bastion ', a ring of islands protected by asw ships to prevent their tracking and destruction by us attack submarines . subs aren't invisible , and if enough are located and tailed , they can be wiped out . this is for their own protection , to get within rapid striking distance of washington means sailing in waters heavily patrolled by usn maritime patrol , submarine , and antisubmarine assets . america categorically has better overall acoustic systems and has for some time , and its submarine force is easily the most modernized portion . the threat to russia is really stealth aircraft . the f-35 can carry 2 b-61 bombs to any target in combat radius , and they're based in the baltics and across poland right now . a low-level stealth attack on moscow would take them 24 minutes from vilnius . assuming they're detected at half that range , that's twelve minutes to react and conduct a launch order . we don't know the relative parity on spotting a fully stealthed f-35 . it could well be they would have less than five minutes . an alpha strike of f-35s targeted at dead hand communication launch sites could destroy those icbms on launch , preventing failsafe orders from reaching missile silos and submarines . putin keeps throwing these threats around because he is * very * desperate . it is entirely possible in his calculus right now that at the moment he suggests conducting a real nuclear war nato will conduct a coordinated siop-style nuclear strike that annihilates the country and leaves it a smoldering ruin in trade for several million americans and europeans . it would most assuredly be the death knell of the governments that launched it , subject to colossal war crimes tribunals , be the resulter of massive cancer increases , possibly collapse the world economy from emp , and may not even work . but it * might work *, and that's the horror story for putin . in a game of mutually assured destruction , he might have failed to do any of that ."
7948,does the imperialistic american machine know no bounds ?
7949,"it was tough to plan , it was only cool enough to do it at night ...."
7950,\ o / praise the sun
7951,and cats .
7952,"likely not immediately . the suwalki gap between lithuania and poland is a nato weak point . if war ever broke out , russia would likely go through there and connect to kaliningrad to belarus . doable for them . they'd hold out for a while that way . obviously kaliningrad would fall sooner rather than later , at which point they'd respond with nukes , and everyone loses . but whatever . hopefully nato keeps investing in defense and ensures suwalki is no longer a weak point ."
7953,no . but how about the not improvised submarines . sweden and finland rather join europe the putin . does he think he can fool everyone . finland is even at its boarders . hope the russian people murder putin . do what you do when kgb wants to rule your country
7954,resund represent !
7955,where does their water go ?
7956,"there is a legal principle of right of innocent passage . now if the ship in question was armed or carrying military hardware , it would be a different question ."
7957,they know . its how they intend to keep and hold the territory . they are scum .
7958,why did you have to go and ruin my favorite age of empires soldier for me ?
7959,"... at some point you are correct . hopefully in the short term countries can choose not to deal with russia and putin et.al get removed from power ( but lets face it . its russia , so its a 99.9999999 % chance the next regime will be just as bad , at best ). then they can deal with russia again with what ( hopefully but probably not ) is a more stable , human rights respecting , government . but the reality is we are seeing many countries over the world already struggling ( or in crisis like sri lanka ) to have enough oil or natural gas ."
7960,you are not wrong . india and china have been lining up for the deeply discounted oil and gas russia is having to sell for much cheaper . i am sure both countries will buy all they can .
7961,love your name
7962,"nope . putin crossed the line with his nuclear threats . he will be out of the picture soon and , because of his poorly thought out threats , russian nuclear disarmament will be required for their reentry into the world economic community . money talks and ideology walks . especially russias laughably fake ideology . whoever succeeds putin will be weak , constantly in danger , and rightfully unable to trust anyone . russia is slated to be an impotent pawn in future geopolitics ."
7963,theyre also looting the shopping malls in ukraine and sending what they robbed back to russia 
7964,so youll take $ 3.50 ?
7965,soviet troops in ww2 also murdered and raped all the way to berlin included . take any memoire of a soviet soldier and you'll get frankly nauseating accounts of mass rape to death and stuff like that .
7966,i don't think you can do an absolute comparison . hitler's mindset wasn't that remarkable for the time - while putin is completely out of touch .
7967,its a red and blue striped golfing umbrella !
7968,i have no idea what anyone means
7969,i know what you average
7970,my man !
7971,> body doubles of 50 old shirtless pasty white guys riding horses this would make a pretty awesome indie rock band name .
7972,pretty sure 2 simultaneously launched icbm nukes will warrant a full escalation retaliatory strike . and that'll be the end of the northern hemisphere as we know it .
7973,lets agree on compromise : masturbating chicken
7974,well we had to one up the nazis . they got the dark side of the moon .
7975,"nato vs russia war is endgame boys . be careful what you wish for , i know , the last couple months full of propaganda and war mongering have influenced many , but rmember : last thing we want is real war with russia . ukraine is a playground"
7976,russia loses totally . nato loses 10 %. china also gets a dose . xi wont be keen to support this .
7977,to the strongest
7978,"and even if you debate this , it's not like there's some court system in russia determining their response depending on international legalese . in this situation where we are tip toeing around escalation , de facto matters much more than de jure ."
7979,and then bitching when the postal people steal the loot they stole .
7980,god damn loch ness monster !!!!
7981,"had a jewish guy tell me recently , when asked what his grandfather did in the 40s in europe , that he always said that he "" had a great time "" after he joined the red army and started marching towards berlin . "" i had a gun...and the germans didn't !"" i can imagine how angry people would be though ."
7982,whos being mean ?
7983,"why would a nuclear first strike involve 1 or 2 icbms ? you can fully expect that a first strike will involve a much larger volley to cripple any chance of response . in fact during the soviet 1983 nuclear false alarm , russia detected 5 missile launches that was dismissed in part because of the belief that any nuclear first strike would be massive"
7984,"tactical nuclear weapons are in the sub 100kt , generally 15-80kt range , strategic nukes are mt . it's pretty hard to use a weapon at a battlefield tactical level that can destroy 1000s of square kilometres ."
7985,"its splitting hairs , but most nukes are actually significantly below the 1mt range , with odd exceptions i wanna say the american b83 which has a 1.2mt yield , which is their most powerful , im assuming russia has the odd warhead significantly more than that but the vast majority of warheads are anywhere between 100-500kt or 0.1-0.5mt , which , while still destructive in the extreme , wouldnt erase most modern cities from the map , significant portions granted , but not erase . obviously this is largely irrelevant given theres approx 16000 nukes currently and most missiles carry 5-12 warheads .. eh lets hope nobody is silly enough"
7986,tbh getting to the dark side of the sun is more impressive .
7987,"people have become too adjusted to war thanks to how often were in it . they should be scared , we are on the brink of extinction ."
7988,""" i stole that fair and square !"" "" da , and now i steal from you , fair and square !"""
7989,"> why would a nuclear first strike involve 1 or 2 icbms an extremely high yield , probably 1 + megaton nuclear weapon , acting as an emp . thats quite literally the only reason to open up a full scale first strike with a single icbm , and thats still ** extremely ** risky , especially with the better technology when compared to previous false alarms in the 20th century . in a first strike scenario , the more likely method of attack would be a counter force strike ( targeted at the enemys missile fields , submarine bases , early warning sites , command and control bunkers , sac bases ). it would probably work against a country such as north korea , pakistan , india , and * maybe * china , but not against a target with massive second strike capability ( aka russia/america ) in a real , active , nuclear exchange , the second the first nuclear weapon is confirmed inbound ( for the us that would be the cobra dane radar in shemya , alaska detecting the icbm during its cruise phase in leo , which combined with the thermal bloom of a valid launch would be nearly impossible to be a false alarm ), everything that is exposed ( icbms in silos , nuclear capable aircraft on the ground ) is going to be launched , while second strike weapons ( ssbns ) will be held in reserve incase counter value ( nuking cities to nuke cities ) is necessary . god i really fucking hope that never happens ."
7990,"because in a case like this , russia still wouldn't want mutually assured destruction . they could respond to what they claim is a nuclear threat with a "" measured "" nuclear response of a few missiles . launch 1000 and both sides get wiped off the map . launch 2 and you make it clear that you intended it and won't hesitate to do it again , while making it likely you only suffer a few being fired back ."
7991,they survived . russian mbts have an internal fire-suppression system thats lmfao no they mega ded .
7992,my dude look at the amount of artillery that field has taken tho
7993,"i am sad for the farmers who own these fields . there are a lot of projectiles that did not explode hidden in the fields . it does not even matter who fired them , with the amount of visible impacts even the lower failure rates of the ua would leave a lot of potential death traps behind ."
7994,"not the highest turret flip , but excellent rotation throughout . spinning like a top !"
7995,that is one spectacular gesture of good will .
7996,what did that ? javelin ?
7997,holy shit . those guys need to give up smoking .
7998,"it's incredible how high a tank's turret can be blown when the ammunition detonates . when i read tanker memoirs from ww2 about turrets flying 40 or 50 feet into the air , i used to think it was bullshit , but then after seeing a few battlefield recordings of it , and now more modern stuff like this , turret tossing seems to be one of the relatively few aspects of those memoirs that * wasn't * exaggerated ."
7999,woah . these are ukraines survival olympics . and they are raking in the gold medals .
8000,to infinity and beyond .
8001,"moscow , we have a problem"
8002,"i was going to say an explosion that big cant be a tank. but , by god , it is . i guess thats what happens when you take a hit right in the ammunition carousel ."
8003,fly me to the moon
8004,they can join that dog they murdered in space
8005,"what the fuck was that thing ? whatever that was , it had to detonate ammo inside on first try ( without setting tank on fire ) and maybe as first hit at all ( crew is inside , they sometimes run ). roadside ied ? lucky shot from artillery ? out of frame atgm ? at any rate one less tank of invaders"
8006,"i did not know russian tanks had ejection seats , but it meakes sense ."
8007,yuri so proud .
8008,"you wouldn't think it , but both professions are simular , since they both tend to end being burned alive in a fiery death ."
8009,such a honorable display of goodwill of fellow ruskie men towards global efforts for space exploration ! god speed

8011,thats an impressive lift !! i love it when ruzzian trolls are too drunk to push down good vids . hope this is recent and credible source .

8054,welcome to ukraine !! slava ukraini !
8055,blasted so hard the bethesda physics kicked in
8056,russia will never ever win this war ! blood on putin's hands

8058,weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ! i can see my house from here !
8059,best one ive seen so far
8060,this russian turret throwing competition is getting out of hand
8061,spectacular ! a prime candidate for the annual turret toss championship of 2022
8062,russia invading ukraine is fucked . glorifying and joking about people dying is also fucked
8063,these are still humans being killed i dont understand what so funny.they are not all bad they are not all rapists most of them have no choice but to be there
8064,"what i notice is all the holes in the surrounding countryside which makes me think that the vast majority of artillery rounds are completely wasted . unless you are aiming for something large like an airport runway , or railway shunting yard ( or in the case of the russians , an apartment complex ), why bother ? ukraine has been asking for more artillery and much more ammunition but it seems that it is of marginal utility as compared with armed drones . can someone who knows about these things please comment ?"
8065,"i'm guessing it was empty . if a tank isn't moving , any reasonably sane crew is probably outside of it ."
8066,hope you gave him a flag .
8067,good turret toss
8068,would all the ordinance detonate or would there be some ejected for a farmer to run over later .
8069,are they ok ?!
8070,"i never much thought about it , but if ru tanks are anything like us tanks , there are crew inside the turrets . ( 3 out of 4 in a us tank , presumably 2 out of 3 in an ru tank .) so , some crew are launched up in the air along with the turret , i suppose ?!?"
8071,was that a person flying in the air ?
8072,and the turret decided it wanted to become an mi-24 .

8130,you can see the bodies flying though the air . its pretty clear

8136,i think orc bacon
8137,yeah that's the first thing that i saw . that's gonna take a long time to make safe . the fields are full of scrap metal and unexploded ordnances . north of france remembers . so much land renderered unexploitable .
8138,"yeah its actually so sad . you read all these stories about wwi moonscapes and you think that time is passed , of course that couldnt happen in 2022 . but no , theres some prick in russia who wants to cause hell on earth just because whatever fatal disease hes dying of means hell soon experience hell first hand . it breaks my heart . the fat , foetal alcohol faced , fuck ."
8139,"serious questionis it going to be unsafe for people to eat all the grains , etc . exported by ukraine following all of this ? that field looks fucked ."
8140,"if you look at the crater analysis , it seems to be a good amount of defensive indirect fire . rounds coming from a lateral linear trajectory will "" blast backward "" toward their launch point . this is true of mortars and artillery , anyway ."
8141,more pockmarked than an alcoholics face
8142,those are merely sand traps . it identifies as a golf course .
8143,"we have that exact issue in north east of france , from ww1 and ww2 . massive fields still packed of lead and unexploded ordnances . absolutely heartbreaking ."
8144,"yes , that is food growing land , would have fed a lot of people , and made for excellent exports for the country if not eaten in ukraine itself . many people are going hungry , not just during the war , but far into the future ."
8145,i thought the same thing .
8146,8-8-6 - darn french judge ...
8147,"disqualified , that's not the turret but equipment rack on top of the vehicle . source : finnish military journalist ."

8150,spin to win !
8151,russian space program .
8152,is that the turret that went spinning up ?
8153,thats a good trick !
8154,just doesn't quite reach orbital velocity . it's a shame really .
8155,wait seriously ? this one doesn't beat the previous record ?
8156,"hard to say . there was a story in the paper here of a ukrainian territorial defense unit that killed a t-90 with a canadian-donated carl gustav . in theory , the tank should have easily survived . but with the ammo being stored the way it is , it blew up ."
8157,not a mine . i see nothing coming from either side . come on armchair experts . what did that ?
8158,"best guess would be an apfsds round from another tank hitting the ammo carousal . the tank was stationary so it probably wasn't a mine . i wasn't able to spot any kind of projectile hitting the tank , which would mean that it was something small or incredible fast . a javelin travels 140 m/s and is big enough that you should be able to see it in this clip . meanwhile a apfsds round is smaller in diameter but also is much faster with around 1700 m/s depending on the round . obviously that would be near impossible to spot here ."
8159,that's what i want to know . wtf did that ?
8160,"helicopter himars , new secret weapon from ukraine . it's a chinook with a himars rocket pod attached . / s"
8161,i smoke 155mm rounds for fun . quite the high . ( prime avatar )

8163,rt : russia legalizes marijuana ...
8164,well in hindsight the could have smoked a lot more
8165,let me lay among the tsars .
8166,"just read about smart 155 mm rounds being supplied . this isn't necessary the case , but the usage looked similar"
8167,"ukrainian space program , more like . but its only in the experimental phase , so they have to use foreign volunteers ."
8168,"everyone has a choice . that last part is simply not true . most soldiers who take part in special military operation are contract soldiers , especially tank crews which is a military profession . they still kill people on my land for 5th month now . they can always surrender and receive a big sum of money and go live a normal life . you just underestimate the hate russians have for ukraine and the power of russian propaganda machine ."
8169,"cannon artillery like this is not a precision weapon ( esp russian d20 ) after one shot , even if you are aiming at something particular like a building you gonna miss at first second and sometimes even third shot . thats why correcting your fire with drones is so important . also , we dont know what happened in this field and most likely its a result of many days of counter battery duel . might be some sof guys doing night operations and being shot . its not like all these holes were result of fighting that took that day"
8170,"new to me , so it's fine with me . don't like to see something twice ? just keep scrolling ."
8171,"there will be a lot of unexploded ordinance in those fields , likely for years to come . even when shells are well maintained you still get the occasional shell that doesn't explode , but when you have poorly maintained shells that number can increase exponentially . places in europe still occasionally find unexploded ordinance from ww2 . from january 2022 : edit : march 2022 :"
8172,"definitely . their flesh flew off their bones , but other than that they are perfectly fine ."
8173,"yeah , they're often flying high with the turret when it goes up ."
8174,"i see two persons , that would make sense if it's full crew . commander and gunner is flying below turret ( driver turned into paste in front and is not visible )"
8175,"whatever ordinance that manages to hit the ammunition sitting below the guys in the tanks . it is called the "" jack in the box flaw "" because it causes the tanks to pop like a jack in the box ."

8178,thats the turret .
8179,"still better than crypto mining , plus watching rapists and murderers die is fairly guilt free ."
8180,from a practical point of view it's quite clever if you don't care about your crew 
8181,"tbf in the 1970s it was a good design , it allows to reduce the crew and lower the tank profile , making it harder to hit . but now we are in 2022 and the penetrating power and precision of the weapons increased drastically ..."
8182,"probably did this so they wouldn't have their "" tech "" stolen and wouldn't have to deal with pow ?"
8183,"a fast death is easier , comrade . you wouldn't want to burn slowly . as they say in the ruzzia , if we're going to go fuck ourselves , we'll do it with a big bada boom ! like our flagman moskva ."
8184,"thats like complaining that a motorcycle has the gas tank between your knees . while you can get creative and find slightly "" better "" places , at the end of the day where else are you really going to put it that it wouldn't kill the crew anyway ?"
8185,"just like in the moskva : "" all the surviving crew were successfully taken off """
8186,"yep , they're known as [ zone rouge ]( and that was as a consequence of the * first * world war ."
8187,member verdun ? france members .
8188,i'm assuming better technology is available to find and remove spent artillery than there was in 1945 ?
8189,"and , if trump ( or a trump-like person ) wins the us election a year and a half from now then financial and military support for ukraine will stop , support for putin will dramatically increase and the world may well have two homicidal assholes calling most of the shots ."
8190,"perfectly safe , these are not depleted uranium , just cheap russian steel"
8191,"the food will be fine , the danger is more to the farmers due to unexploded ordnance etc"
8192,harvest is batch tested ( or should be ) so anything weird should show up if present in any dangerous concentration ... big danger is for farmers because unexploded buried stuff could off with tractors and machinery
8193,back then there werent drones to trigger the explosives . this time it will be easier
8194,cheap land in europe ????
8195,"["" must've been the dismount .""]("
8196,"is there anything the russians wont cheat at ? i mean they are already banned from the olympics , now this , sad !"
8197,"there is no need to lie , we all know [ finland isn't real .]("
8198,this is much more fun than spin the bottle 
8199,yes . a common result when russian tanks are blown up .
8200,"carl gustav is a hell of a weapon , im surprised we dont see more of it . especially the titanium sof version ."
8201,"> in theory , the tank should have easily survived . what do you mean ? any side or rear hit from a ffv751 is killing a t90 . front armor might be enough to stop it but it any antitank crew with a carl gustav would know that ."
8202,maybe the russian tank just up and fucked itself .
8203,ivan was there smoking another cig before he bounced . mother fucker ivan !
8204,"presumably a shell . that's the only thing that would not show up in the video , right ? the tank is stationary , hence relatively easy to zero in on it with some high-precision artillery . as long as they just keep sitting there . if they were moving , you probably wouldn't even try with conventional artillery . guided missile instead , maybe . still not safe for the tank . but there is a little-known survival trick : it's been found that russian tanks that unload their guns and head either due west or due east very fast have the highest survivability . recent research shows that if all russian tank crews dd one or the other , they would stand a much better chance of living to an old age ."
8205,"that leaves us with internal explosion caused by smoking ? makes sense for stuff flying up . theres one more tank ahead of it too . sincerely , armchair general"
8206,"further up the road along the tree line there is something smoking , but can't identify what it is . since the tank isn't moving , i wonder if they are in a battle with someone else . i doubt a mine , unless it was a delayed reaction for some reason ( faulty ?) but maybe someone got a lucky shot or something that came out of the tree line next to the tank ."
8207,aiming with artillery at such a tiny moving well armoured target seems like finding a needle in a haystack to me .
8208,is there any reason to think those craters are recent ?
8209,what is the ui line to use one of these ? i imagine they have a map on a screen to select coordinates ? does the tank show up on the screen as well ? how ? a human or drone spotter as indicated its last known position ?
8210,"i think your right . anything else , except a mine i guess , would probably have been more visible on video ."
8211,"doubt this was an artillery hit . ukraine doesn't have the rounds to waste . spread out artillery hits on fields is more of a russian tactic as they have plenty of ammunition to waste while ukraine artillery tends to be more strategic target focused due to their limited ammunition . looking at the video repeatedly , there does appear to be something smoking near the top along the road although i could not identify it . since the tank is stationary it could be that they were in a battle with something else , another tank or a ground unit , and someone got a lucky shot in ."
8212,putin's hubris
8213,"after getting hit by a 155 shell , you'll never have an experience to top it ."
8214,let me see what a barrage is like from ukrainian himars
8215,"i don't say you're wrong , but i'd expect a plume of smoke from explosion above , like this [ maybe it's out of frame edit : that's the same video edit : maybe that's a javelin or something else that attacks on top , or perhaps parm mine shot from the woods , or some mine with shaped charge underneath"
8216,great . thanks for responding .
8217,reposts are against the rules
8218,thank you ! good to know they're destructured but ok
8219,"no , but if the view is from a great distance then you might get a quick glimpse of it going over that space . not this time i guess ."
8220,or want to incentivize them to kill the other guy first . it would just incentivize me to find out my bmp suddenly had water in its gas .. 3rd one this week sergeant ivan !
8221,"actually it was quite clever in the early 70s . gun accuracy was in the pits compared to now , and atgms that could do something were very cumbersome . putting ammo down low was a good idea . but today ... thats a different story . honestly by the 90s this design was starting to crack against nato weapons . late edit : the design is a blast from the past !"
8222,you make it sound like its putins fault . the crew wouldnt be dead if they believed enough in the cause
8223,"they care about their tank crews so much that they have gone out of their way to ensure none of them die a slow , horrible death . edit : sorry about resurecting an old post . i was linked here from somewhere else and didn't notice that the post was 14 days old !"
8224,"back when the primary threat to tanks was other tank guns , the lower the ammo storage , the better , made it much less likely to get hit ."
8225,western tanks have systems in place to protect the crew in case of an ammunition fire like blowout panels and internal bulkheads
8226,"thankfully ukraine is several orders of magnitude lower in how much artillery is getting used . frequent fire is known as drumbeat from the sound . in ww1 there was no beat . just a continous , deafening roar . for * weeks *. all aimed at one location ."
8227,i always want to tell family visiting paris to visit the red windmill .
8228,seeing the green over parts of verdun now is surreal
8229,you'd need a lot more fundings and to excavate several meters for each bip . the ground itself is polluted with arsenic and other highly toxic components that you could find in ww1 ordnances . the red zone a no man's land . forever .
8230,"mmm , steel-cut oats !"
8231,you know that steel is full of shit like lead and other toxic minerals . the sanctions shouldn't end when the ruzzians retreat . the sanctions should end when ruzzia fixes all the infrastructure they've destroyed
8232,"it's not for sale . it's not liveable . at the current cleaning rate , you'd need 500 more years before it's deemed safe ."
8233,"i mean , their ships do it too apparently ."
8234,it appears that way from the video .
8235,pretty on-brand .
8236,even the tanks themselves are fed up with this shit
8237,that answers it !
8238,tank to tank seems most likely to me as well .
8239,the post before yours was a classic reddit _well ackshually_
8240,"that depends on your definition of recent , i mean , i can guarantee you none of them are older than 4 months ."
8241,they are not recent . as in shells that just missed the tank that was hit .
8242,i was in bits about it .
8243,"fuck that , it's not a repost . we had to click on a link to watch it . here we can watch it in all its glory without having to make a useless click ."
8244,"because if we're talking global impact on the planet environmentally , the russian invasion of ukraine has less impact than crypto-mining . the world won't be destroyed because a bunch of land grabbing , toilet-stealing , kid raping , civilian killing , russian losers got barbequed in their shitty 1980's tank . i also won't feel sorry for them . they would be alive to drunkenly beat their wives and rape their nieces right now if they had just stayed where they belonged . maybe they will figure that out once another 30k are lying cold in refrigerated train cars , far from home ."
8245,"these engines are shit , sarge"
8246,or if you are only sending ethnic minorities to the war ...
8247,back in the day they needed an nkvd commissar to make sure their tank crews didn't run when they got hit . nowadays they've automated the process .
8248,"sergeant ivan : "" what ? there shouldn't be anymore gas !"""
8249,"plus , using the autoloader decrease crew from 4 to 3 ."
8250,"damnit , that blast-edit was very much worth it !!"
8251,i'd say it was the other way around : western weaponeers learned of that design feature and made top attack atgm - because this way it's way easier to hit ammo and cause cookoff . just like in this video
8252,their family clearly weren't sending enough thoughts and prayers .
8253,"> you make it sound like its putins fault . the crew wouldnt be dead if they believed enough in the cause you make it sound like ** it's *** ** putin's *** fault . the crew ** wouldnt *** it's * it's = it is or it has its = the next word or phrase belongs to it putin's * fault putins = more than one putin use a possessive , not a plural . wouldn't * wouldn't = would not wouldnt = not a word in english ffs , learn how to use an apostrophe ."
8254,"they do , but the placement is still fairly similar . which is what i thought we were talking about . these soviet tanks already have use systems to help protect , they just don't have maybe as advanced of a system ."
8255,"plus worse accuracy , and i'd wager more duds too ."
8256,ptsd warning :
8257,"we still cant cultivate those lands because of ammunition pollution though , even a century after"

8259,nope . not in the slightest .
8260,i found it extremely informative .
8261,fair point well made .
8262,"in my experience ( ex-army , artillery , got out 20 + years ago ) 200k rounds is not that much when you consider that russia is hitting ukraine with an average of 60k artillery shells/rockets per day : with unguided rounds your talking at least 3 rounds ( average ) to try and "" walk in "" on a target and no decent commander would spend what looks like a a few dozen rounds on that farmland ( at least , probably more ) to hit a single tank . it would be a waste when your better off going for more strategic targets like ammo depots . if it was a guided round that they could do in a single hit , then "" maybe "" i could see it if the tank was heading towards a valuable area but still usually you don't use artillery on a single tank like that . your better saving your artillery rounds for targets that will take out large groups of men/equipment , especially if it will do so through secondary explosions . this is one of the reasons why ukraine has hit so many ammo depots with artillery , not only do they take out large areas with secondary explosions with minimal use of shells but they also cut off supplies to front line russian units ."
8263,but one got to fly higher than the other two ... it's not fair
8264,then from 3 to 0
8265,"aaah the crew size isnt such a plus . it takes less crew , but there are less hands there when maintaining the thing on the field . much of the time crew has work with the tank not just inside . the german new panther has a crew of 3 with a 4th seat for a specialist[drones , jaming , commander etc ] or just to help maintaining on the field ."
8266,> decrease crew decrease**s ***
8267,i think that one might get on the podium of the turret tossing olympics .
8268,"no that's not the reason for top-attack munitions . you can only put so much armour onto a tank or you increase it's weight so much that other factors have to suffer , like mobility , logistics etc . you can't bulk up every spot the same and obviously all tank manufacturer decided that the best spot for that limited amound of impactfull protection has to go to the fron . which is logical since you want to engage your enemy from that direction . the sides are also armoured to various degrees but in general the top of a vehicle is the weakest part . you have to remember that most tanks that are the backbone of most armies today were designed in the 70's to 90's , in a time where top attack wasn't really a thing . normal atgm's or in general shaped-charge warhead could be defeated by the composite armour and by era which also helped protect the sides of a tank for relatively low weight from those weapons . top-attack was not designed to specificacly detonate russian style autoloaders but to penetrate the weakspot every tank has by design where also most of the crew is located : the turret"
8269,there's an app for that . google it lol !
8270,bet you're fun at parties
8271,i thought i was a male-karen but holy shit
8272,best estimates are 10 % duds in wwi .
8273,"yes , sadly , and theres still munition and bones there . but the undulating landscape is surreal ."
8274,mr engineering has indeed done the math !
8275,"wise words but you are applying sensible military logic to the discussion and in russia that has no relevance . you don't need to maintain a tank that will be a pile of rusty junk after 3 or 4 days and if it doesn't explode putin's master plan calls for all "" special military operations "" to be successfully concluded after 3 or 4 days , so either way no maintenance is required in the field . if operation fails - no maintenance . if operation succeeds - 3 to 4 days max in combat then put on train and ship back to belgorod and strip it's major components for conversion to yacht gold taps . its a win-win ."
8276,"russian tank designers essentially decided for a tradeoff that increases survivability from side attack compared to top attack . reasonable , since then there was no top attack atgms"
8277,"holly * sincerely , even more male-karen , lol"
8278,oh you are if you think so .
8279,a third of all british shells during the battle of the somme failed to detonate . millions of unexploded shells .
8280,nice of them to park it between two fields and do an auto-fertilizing operation .
8281,"considering that the russians have been using the same low profile tank design from the t-54 onwards till they unveiled the t-14 i don't think that's really the case in the sense that it was even a descision that had to be made since armouring up the top conflicts with their low profile , low visibility design ."
8282,"the fact that it can offroad at all is somewhat impressive , but itd likely be useless on anything with bumps/debris . only really useful in the open , flat field ."
8283,imagine getting merked by a dude rolling up on you like this . id die accepting i deserved it for letting that happen to me .
8284,orc : blyet nato gave ukraine cyborgs .
8285,"the future is here . first drones , now electric unicycles ."
8286,"conserved energy , that's a plus for me in any scenario . edit : also give that man nlaw x2 ."
8287,how in the fuck russkiez thought even for a second they could win vs ua chads like this .
8288,"god electric unicycles are the future . considering their size : they can off road really well , they have a mad range , and their speed is cracked . as much as walk able cities are important , if people road these instead of cars , congestion wouldn't exist ."
8289,a weapon to surpass metal gear
8290,i keep seeing these on the streets of paris .
8291,i didn't think of that for a drive-by shooting .
8292,"from what i can see , it seems to work better than ruzzian tanks"
8293,"this is an older model , there are badass offroad models averaging 2500 $ nowadays . those can ride up to 50km/h or more and are extremly nimble . a squad of trained soldier could be extremely effective on those ( especially in cities )"
8294,"you see a man riding that thing down the street , and you know he's not afraid of anything ."
8295,thats sick man !! let's goo !!
8296,"pretty useful , this particular is not very offroad . but i have inmotion v12 with a wider tire , going on mtb and enduro paths and gravel roads is not an issue . my top speed record on gravel sections with bumps and stuff is 50kph . pretty good considering this is the only device of this type you can use completely hands-free ."
8297,whole new meaning to motorised infantry .
8298,"auto bots , roll out !"
8299,whats the name of the song ?
8300,"pretty funny to see it here as i was going to the military office recently on my euc and one of the guards was a v5f rider himself , and we started talking about different models and stuff ."
8301,anything that's not unwieldy and allows a soldier to move faster than under his own power has its uses .
8302,what kind of device is that anyway ?
8303,suprised it works in grass ...
8304,lemme think ... a quiet fast way to gfto of there ... i'd use one .
8305,not at all .
8306,"the future is now , orc man ."
8307,and it looks like an inmotion v8 ! someone send that man a veteran sherman with some grizzla power pads and upgraded pedals !
8308,youtube title : i drove this one wheeler during war ( unexpectedly gone wrong )
8309,why no star wars music for this ?
8310,that wheel is fast as fuck . i think they can hit 55 on the road .
8311,a motorbike probably more useful ?
8312,its just for lols . good thing is that he doesnt shoot grass like kadyrovtsy .
8313,incredibly dangerous if he trips over while his finger is on the trigger .
8314,thats mr garrison's it without the four flexigrips
8315,3000 segways of zelensky
8316,is this new forthnite loot or something ?
8317,"* war , war has changed ...*"
8318,blathering blatherskite !
8319,i like to use it on my way to work
8320,don't worry the segway battalion is here
8321,"none at all , but still funny :)"
8322,"it's dangerous .. since it distracts the operator's focus on possible , hidde threats . ( imho )? maybe for recreational fun at the base and to get soe beer ?"
8323,why do i hear doom music ?
8324,give the russians ptsd
8325,these things are death traps if you go at too much sleed and hit a rock or an obstacle
8326,what about those segways ?
8327,"doubt it , it would be better invest in electric dirt bikes which have much better off-road capability"
8328,""" the future is now , old man """
8329,shooter on a scooter .
8330,this is some fortnight shit right here . i love it .
8331,that's about as useful as a 2 peckered billy goat on the battle field .
8332,would it be difficult to shoot whilst riding that thing ? i'm imagining the recoil spinning you around lol
8333,cute but how you gonna charge it in the bush ? makes a funny clip though .
8334,tactically not useful at all . makes you a larger target and the added speed could also be achieved with something more conventional and easier to handle like a motorcycle ( if you want a smaller target ) or car .
8335,good for finding mines . might lose equipment and soul . made in china
8336,that is officially the ' least nerdy ' that thing has ever looked .
8337,modern day cavalry .
8338,"imagine this but with two bigger wheels instead of one , and that is powered by muscles that dont need electricity to work , and that can offroad in quite adverse settings , and that also is already present in almost any household . how useful would that be compared to this ?"
8339,"methodman's verse on that track is kinda slick , too"
8340,"i love seeing the emergence of pev in this war . bike , scooter and unicycle are all becoming indispensable to the war effort , for both military and civilian use . if i'm on recon , keep the ifv and give me one of these . cheap , silent , and fast . top speed 60 mph ."
8341,gives new meaning to mobile infantry 
8342,wouldn't a bicycle just be better ?
8343,feels like a modern equivalent to ski soldiers
8344,"imagine , a large sum of people sending thousands of these to ukraine and videos of ukrainian soldiers flood the streets in a massive wave to steamroll every orc in their path . beautiful ."
8345,i used my segway to get fast far down the trail when i was about getting confronted by park rangers . waved and pointed to my ears at 10 mph . later fatties !
8346,eat nuts !!! mr meth you know how we do
8347,when are rocket back packs being delivered ?
8348,now that's just showing off !
8349,gotta have humor on the battlefield .
8350,"this the first time i have ever thought that a unicycle could be useful in anyway . i stunned and feel a drift , nothing in this world is for certain ."
8351,"it's awesome . fastest 100m range you'll ever traverse . jk , no idea the actual range . obviously , it will be very dependent on grade , operator mass , and terrain . but that looks like a blast . i'd buy one if it had a range of 3 + miles ."
8352,hey that's the euc i got for emily
8353,whole new meaning for scooting and shooting !
8354,useless
8355,i think its to cover large amounts of field in a short time and then drop it off maybe ?
8356,"finnish troops had skis , ukrainian troops have that ."
8357,never knew hipsters were in ukraine
8358,and dry . the slightest bit of damp ground and the rider is eating mud
8359,"there are versions that off-road extremely well , including going up a foot or down 2 at a time without benefit of slope . i was thinking of getting one for fun but country-specific regulations , ugh ."
8360,i think that thoose being able to offroad depends more on the skills of the one that drives them
8361,"this is an electric unicycle made for use in urban environmentstheres a similar product called a one wheel thats got a fatter wheel and is made more for off roadingactually im too lazy to watch a 13 minute video right now , but [ heres ]( a comparison of the two for off roading edit : for not fit "
8362,"not the case , [ the one is a clip here is a smaller model , but still ."
8363,"open , flat fields are rarely where you want to be in combat"
8364,maybe in city combat too ?
8365,people offroad r/electricunicycle s all the time . here polish vlogger [ wrongway trying it out ]( i'm still learning to ride mine .
8366,first time he roles into a drainage ditch he will need medical evacuation .
8367,i could kinda see it being useful for local message delivery ( in event of russian jaming or intercepting ) taking messages to and from areas with roads . but anything else might be pushing it really . it cant be that useful .
8368,don't forget it is battery powered and becomes a rock to carry when it dies .
8369,are you sure about that ?
8370,"the phycological effect is big though , imagine never seen one of those before and seeing someone speeding towards you while shooting ."
8371,they see me rollin they droppin
8372,not truly impressed until i see some ukrainian hipster cap the enemy from a penny farthing .
8373,dude be rolling into your camp on that and killing everybody without stopping
8374,"due to the different camo pattern of the dude behind him at the beginning i believed an orc was watching him ... but if we ever invent energy shields this roller could be used in battle . but the usefulness and speed in off terrain is quite interesting . edit : wow , one must add / s for satire to postings in order to avoid downvotes here from simpletons ."
8375,i cant stop laughing at this
8376,i read this in trevor noahs voice
8377,don't ua already use a elektric bike ? sometimes a video did pop up here
8378,"no , the future is now moment is german mechanics teaching in real time ukrainian mechanics how to repair the newly delivered german arty using ar/vr headsets .... like holy shit ."
8379,"mount a m240 , opitics , and remote control ; unicycle death drone ."
8380,"my thoughts too . of course , it depends on the terrain but still ."
8381,i'm not sure if you are conserving energy with this . i assume you'll end up carrying it most of the time .
8382,im going to take a guess that the people riding around on a one wheel arent actively fighting the russians
8383,"i'm curious if army really does want to look into this one wheel shit . they are in jet packs so why not this ? when you can move troops fast , quiet , off-road , long distance , they should definitely look into it and probably will ."
8384,"they're awesome , but eating shit falling off then hurts . i have a veteran sherman , and only ride it with motocross gear now because i fell off it once doing 30mph and fucked my knees and elbows up bad ."
8385,heroyam onewheel !
8386,something like that but used as a mule or cargo carrier could be interesting . anything that frees up soldiers to fight more effectively .
8387,the beatnuts - se acabo remix
8388,or even the same speed without tiring themselves .
8389,they have motorbikes and electric bikes in the ukrainian military
8390,"modern euc are a lot more powerfull than this one , also user have the hands completely free , as far as i know there is no other transport like that"
8391,they have electric bikes now .....
8392,you never have your finger on the trigger unless you intend to shoot .
8393,blasphemy
8394,how does riding a motorcycle makes you a smalle target than an euc ? motorbikes are a lot bigger than eucs
8395,good thing ukraines ground is hard as shit to dig into
8396,are you like in germany or netherlands ?
8397,not really many boards with small wheels would be terrible for off-road .
8398,tweet this at the company ! let's get a batallion on wheels !
8399,that is definitely skill . but there are new eucs that have suspension too
8400,"just for anyone's information , one wheel is a shitty company and has designed their products in a way that make it so that you cannot repair them without ruining them . they are the only ones that will repair them and there is only one repair facility in the us . do not purchase from that company"
8401,there are plenty of models that run off-road just fine . i have the v-12 and she kills it on trails .
8402,"i have onewheel and i have rode euc , and uc beats onewheel in offroading ."
8403,"if you have a road-ish sort of area to work with i think it has its uses . not like it requires petrol , just a charge ."
8404,"actually the wheel still turns even when the power is off , you can push it pretty easily . bigger models are fast with a good autonomy ."
8405,"batteries sure are hard to charge , or swap out ."
8406,that person would be dead literally instantly .
8407,try'na catch me killing russkies
8408,"german special operation accomplished , consider it as a gesture of good will ."
8409,"damn , now i want to drive an ice pick through my brain"
8410,yeah they are badass too . battery technology is so much better now those bucks have real range and speed . they are also exceptionally quiet .
8411,have a specific designs for a specific terrain .
8412,"here we go . lithium batters are what is powering this , they where charged at some point storing energy . its sits and waits for a little switch then releases pushing this legend forward . which means he doesn't have to . these can go for miles . fit him with 2x nlaw/sniper , you got 40mp nightmare for orcs . use the tech around you to its maximum effect . i hate saying this here . ( because of the d-orcs )"
8413,thank you !
8414,"thats my point , i dont see this being more useful then what is already deployed"
8415,hard to keep your head low on an euc . easier to lose your balance on an euc . a dirtbike would be a better use in military operations then a euc .
8416,only at the moment - all change during autumn and spring .
8417,"depends on the tire , doesn't it ?"
8418,yes . some are suprisingly good though . my one wheel could boogy that bush line with ease .
8419,well thats shady af ! thanks for sharing !
8420,"may i ask you a question ? if a person had a spine problem and had a hard time walking , do you think one of these would make moving ( around a small farm ) easier ?"
8421,"light infantry which are as mobile as old cavalry were , and with a fraction of the support footprint . i have to think there are some impressive mil-spec ebikes out there ."
8422,1 wheel has only 1 design . forward .
8423,np
8424,"bigger eucs are as good as dirtbikes though . but the ability to have your hands free is something only euc has and it's very useful in a military case specifically . the ebike manufacturer was saying that usually they are used as a last-mile solution for snipers , euc is about 3 times smaller and lighter to put in a vehicle . plus there is a lot of boring walking patroling tasks that need to be done in the military even a small euc would help with that . crazy cool offroad capable eucs are a very recent development , but one day they'll make a military-specific one for sure ."

8427,"i had slipped disc on my back and any steps felt like hammering the back , so i drove onewheel to avoid taking steps . but that only works on smooth surfaces . you got to strain to be stable on gravel or in grass . so they need extra physical strain to stay mounted . also onewheel lacks torque big time , so euc with larger tyre can climb better and has most likely the same torque or more . learning to use onewheel or euc involves jerky movements and falling off . if that is absolutely off the table , don't even dream of it ."
8428,"think about an electric scooter instead of this . you have to engage your core more with the unicycle , with a scooter you at least have handle bars and there's virtually no learning curve ."
8429,"ok , its off the table . thank you ! ( walking is really the bestcareful steps )."

8434,"** ss :** this is a pretty big escalation in tensions by russia , perhaps in response to the sanctions imposed by the biden administration earlier this morning . it appears as though things are continuing to heat up and trend towards things getting worse . anticipating a response to this from ukraine and/or its allies . things are definitely picking up and this is quite an interesting development as this is the first true action being taken outside of massing troops on the borders and making statements/threats . will be interesting to see if washington responds ."
8435,"** update 10:45 cst : ukraine has issued a response to the announcement and has called on its diplomatic partners for further support .** "" the russian federation has announced the closure from next week to october 2021 of part of the black sea in the direction of the kerch strait for warships and state vessels of other countries under the pretext of military exercises . such actions of the russian federation are another attempt in violation of the norms and principles of international law to usurp the sovereign rights of ukraine as a coastal state , as it is ukraine that has the rights to regulate navigation in these areas of the black sea . this step is also a gross violation of the right to freedom of navigation guaranteed by the un convention on the law of the sea . according to the convention , the russian federation must not obstruct or impede transit through the international strait to ports in the sea of azov . against the background of the ongoing increase in its military presence along the border with ukraine on land , russia has begun to intensify the escalation at sea . it transfers warships from the caspian sea and strengthens its military potential in the azov-black sea region , and , despite the lack of legal grounds , decided to close this area to warships of other countries , including ukraine . the behavior of the russian side indicates the absence of any intention on its part to refuse to continue the aggression against ukraine using military and hybrid methods . the ministry of foreign affairs of ukraine strongly protests against these actions of the russian federation and demands the immediate cancellation of the decision to illegally close certain waters of the black sea . we call on international partners to increase political and diplomatic pressure on the aggressor state in order to cancel the decision to close the waters and stop the escalation in the azov-black sea region ."""

8461,"sanctions aren't going to change putin's mind . sanctions are very harmful to a country's economy but , the most affected will be the normal people . putin is completely detached from the working class and the average people . as he has shown all these years , he cares little about the russian people . he lives in his little bubble with his billionaire buddies . authoritarian governments will let their people starve and go through the toughest of times in order to acheive their goals ."
8462,"another user commented that it is a military exercise for russia . that could explain the timeline , but who knows ."
8463,this is the first time i have heard of this . looked it up ( no mention in the major western media recently . russia's response to military buildup was ' response to nato buildup ' which now appears reasonable

8475,fees like damned if we do and damned if we don't .
8476,"i think there is a middle ground . ua in nato cannot happen now - but the need for it will disappear if russia stop being fuckheads . give them the crimea on the condition they withdraw support in eastern ukraine conflict . ns2 will get completed , russia is the big winner there ( ua one of the big losers ), no point fighting it - anymore ; maybe it can be used as a bargaining chip as well . forget nato for now ; defuse this situation , and then spend the next 10 years focusing on building a strong ukraine , and a positive relationship with russia ."
8477,russia doesnt want to be part of the western world they want to control it . the failure in policy has been not being hard enough
8478,this can only work if the russian people want it . germanys russian politics was exactly that . putin lied to everyone for years . as long he is in charge russia will never return to the international community . its important for russians to understand it .
8479,you perform it in your own waters .
8480,there are never easy choices in times like this .. despite what some parties try to tell you .
8481,give them crimea ? russia already has crimea . that ship has sailed . i would think that putin knows biden doesnt really want another major war . that takes away some of the leverage that the allies have . putin will keep calling bluffs .
8482,you write quite a bit . you actually know very little . it's a bit scary . i hope you are not a father or educator .
8483,"russian government and , whats more important , russians themselves dont want to be a part of western world . they blame america for every shit in their lives , and they started a war in ukraine ."
8484,azov sea is russian waters .
8485,"they have the crimea , but not formally recognised as such ."
8486,"russian propaganda says americans pushed ukraine to war , and that ukraine and europe are americas puppets"
8487,"keep their exercise to those waters and don't attempt to exercise authority outside of them and there isn't an escalation . block the strait , deal with the consequences ."
8488,"yea i see your point . i think what russia and china are questioning is why they should have to conform to nato , un dictates . they know that the status of the us as a superpower can decline very rapidly , while us leaders dont seem to recognize their deteriorating position . the us has engaged in far too many elective wars . the dollar as the default reserve currency is the only thing keeping the us afloat . once that changes , the us becomes a second tier nation ."
8489,the strait is a russian possession just like turkey's control over it's strait . russia is free to block it at any time . > deal with the consequences what consequence ? russia just rolled out it's most modern fleet and biden turned back american destroyers .
8490,"the dollar as the default reserve currency has nothing to do with keeping the us afloat and the fact that you suggest that indicates an incredibly poor understanding of how the world reserve currencies work , or why the dollar is even the default reserve currency . its fine to have opinions , but lets not make statements like that as if they're fact when you're very clearly talking about something we both know you are not well versed in . and no , reading an internet article or two does not qualify as "" well versed in ""."
8491,"based on economy and military , plus influence - that is not true ."
8492,stopping the primary market from dealing in russian debt . we don't need to fight russia when we can collapse their economy . are you russian ? you seem to parrot a lot of russian nationalist talking points that don't have basis in legal reality .
8493,"modern monetary theory has now become mainstream in the us . it basically says that you can issue new government debt indefinitely without negative repercussions like runaway inflation . this has not been tested to the degree that it is being tested today . you are just asserting that i dont know what im talking about , and i could say the same of you . the fact is that the present economic circumstances have no precedent : highest loads of government debt ever , highest stock market ever , highest income inequality ever . it seems unlikely that this will continue , and we seem to be overdue for correction or recession . such an event seems likely to affect the dollar ."
8494,"you should read about hypersonic missiles that russia and china have but the us does not . the economy can turn on a dime . the us has been printing money since the 2008 financial crisis without real economic activity to back it up . it is the use of the dollar as reserve currency that keeps it afloat . as for influence , china is building goodwill through the belt and road initiative and vaccine distribution , while the us just seems to issue threats and withdraw from diplomacy ."
8495,> stopping the primary market from dealing in russian debt . we don't need to fight russia when we can collapse their economy . russia can switch into a self sufficient war economy at any time . so you cannot collapse it's economy . do you really want to force russia to abandon all progress in democratization after the 90s ? > are you russian ? you seem to parrot a lot of russian nationalist talking points that don't have basis in legal reality . yes . the kerch strait is a russian possession since russia controls both crimea and mainland . ukraine has other ports in the black sea to do their business .
8496,"china tried to build goodwill with the belt and road - until countries realized the reality of the situation . the us military budget is more than double anyone elses , and they always been at the very forefront of new technology . the country has a lot of problems , but i expect the amount of next gen hardware theyve got under wraps would be still at the front . anyway - the us should be working to build closer ties with russia , and pull them away from china ."
8497,yes china builds diplomacy ? they cant even handle winnie the pooh .
8498,"if the alternative is unchecked russian aggression and terrorism , yes i am completely content with crushing the russian economy . you invaded a sovereign nation . crimea may be physically held by russia but it is an illegitimate holding and not recognized by the international community . this is no different than china's make-believe ever-expanding sea border in the south china sea . have fun getting crushed by economic sanctions . your conscription papers are sure to follow ."
8499,loud and clear...let putin know all his children will not survive the fallout of any nuclear action...no matter how limited
8500,nukes is mutually assured destruction . its a lose lose for everyone . there is no logic beyond that . thats why no one will use nukes including russia ..
8501,"he's all talk , no one wins in a nuclear war , he should be overthrown just for threatening it ."
8502,"using nukes would end humanity , you simple ass lizard brained psychos ."
8503,"'' encircle ukrainian troops there "" it's to late for that russia lost too many troops already ."
8504,"chuck norris said that putler has no functional nukes , they all got russty !"
8505,"uhhhh that's be a baaad idea . as much as i hate what russia doing , us ( where i am from ) has invaded many countries and nobody stopped us . as much as the hate it , russia is a superpower . ukraine has been preparing for years for this and we sell them what they need . it is up to them not nato right now . unless someone can poison putin . or take him out...but that is up to the russian ppl . prayers for ukraine i hope they win this war ."
8506,this sounds like pure propoganda .
8507,all the models show this would be the end . i dont think vlad is that fucking insane . id hope someone would cap him first if he actually is that insane .
8508,what are you going on about ?
8509,it would be an attack on nato...radiation cloud for instance..would surely effect the baltic and central european states .
8510,yeah there's no question that every country would nuke russia within hours of him doing so . i would like to believe he's not that stupid
8511,"uhhh , echoing others , i believe it would put and end to a lot more than that ... if you don't acknowledge that as a part of the original post you either have no idea or need to learn . it's a tough distinction ."
8512,"i think if he used nukes the eu wouldnt even cut off oil , let alone a regime change ."
8513,"using nukes would not only end putin's regime . it would end the life as we know it . putin having nukes is the only reason they can carry on in ukraine , and it is the main reason nato and others can't just stop russia with superior weapons . if hitler had nukes , we all know he would use them when he knew he lost the war . if saddam had nukes , he'd use them too . and we have to remember that usa/the west still is the only one who actually dropped nukes in a war ."
8514,"nuclear weapons don't need to destroy cities to wreak havoc . multiple weapons detonated high in the atmosphere above a country will produce enough of an emp ( electro magnetic pulse ) effect to seriously damage the power grid and destroy non hardened electronic devices . imagine the effect on a country with no power , communications , or transportation . effectively back to the steam age ."
8515,"the thing is , seeing how outdated the russian military is , it could be the same with nuclear weapons considering their economy wouldnt be able to sustain a nuclear program"
8516,"i don't see it . i thought about it at first , but no more . here's why - nato nations are flooding ukraine with ammunition , weapons systems , and even aircraft . there's no way russia doesn't know how these things are getting in to the country - between satellite intelligence , human intelligence , signal intelligence , etc . yet they're not bombing or attacking any of those lanes . assuming it is correct that they know how these things are coming in to the country , i think they're not attacking because they respect the nato alliance and know that their military is not up to the challenge . they would be wiped out in a head-to-head with nato , which would leave nuclear weapons as the only alternative . nukes are a no-win proposition in warfare . their only value is in negotiation and leverage , as we're seeing in this situation ( nobody will get directly involved because of their nuclear threat ). just my opinion ."
8517,"yes it would . it would also end life as we know it in much of the world , given the power of modern nukes ."
8518,using nukes will embark a war no one will survive russia military sucks but they have enough nuke to cover europe
8519,using nukes would end the fucking world . let's not plan around it .
8520,[ here is a link to our exclusive story about it
8521,with extreme prejudice
8522,"russian prime minister yesterday was on india news nearly 1 hour interview . his reply is there is no way russia intends to use nukes , international observers , ministers posters can say whatever dont mean nothing in this world unless it happens its just , whatever , anyway you guys make your mind up here the interview ://"
8523,"india would probably still stay neutral , lol ."
8524,are you 10 years old ? stupid fucking post
8525,thank you all for your comments . this is a part of the new voice of ukraine analysis that says putin won't use nukes as it will destroy his reign .
8526,"i think the one thing that everyone forgets is that the countries that have nuclear weapons only have them so that they don't have to use them . they're a deterrence , and considered the sum of all end games for whomever ends up using them . russia wants to occupy ukraine and/or the geographically important parts to the south and east . it would have been quicker & easier to level an entire city like mariupol with one atomic wmd than the 2 months of constant shelling and bombing ... but nuking something into submission is counterproductive to any plans of setting up shop in the coming decades . the wildcard in this current situation is the respect , sympathy , and compassion of innocent people and all human life that putin obviously lacks . i really think it would take a direct attack on moscow or other large culturally or militarily important places on russian soil in order for putin to go all-in on proving how big of a douchebag he is . the usa is still the only people that have ever used a nuclear weapon , and hopefully remain the only people that ever used them offensively ."
8527,i love the sound of the last half of that statement .
8528,"i found this interesting , over 2000 nuclear bomb tests on planet earth since 1945 ."
8529,the west should make it clear if putin uses tactical nukes then ukraine have the right to use them to . so unless putin wants his entire army in ukraine annihilated he should really think long and hard before making a catastrophic decision
8530,does anyone have a link to show over all reports of losses for each side ? who is winning ?
8531,"putin has a paradoxical combination of grandiose plans for russia and paranoia of a nato we know doesnt any longer exist to counterbalance a ussr that no longer exists . he has this life stage/identity dilemma , but he knows the consequences of a nuclear exchange . he knows how he is being perceived . no one sees him as a misunderstood but well intentioned leader . if he used nukes , no one would consider it justified . both china and russia rely on grey zone actions which individually dont warrant a kinetic response but cumulatively may . a nuclear attack would certainly necessitate retaliation . mutually assured destruction is still very real and russias conventional military is weak . what does it have left to persuade us with ? tactical nukes ? i really find putins position to be weak ."
8532,op you have absolutely zero comprehension of what it is you're suggesting .
8533,"call his hand , he will never launch icbm's and if you look at what he is doing to ukrainian cities , there is very little difference between what he is doing now with conventional weapons , and if he were to use tactical nukes . if putin ever use those tactical nukes , nato would be forced to take action ."
8534,the use of nukes would trigger ww3 and nobody wants that to happen it could end most life as we know it
8535,"if putin did this , he would have no where to go in the world if he had to flee ru . he wouldn't even be allowed to "" retire "" within ru . the personal consequences would be higher than anything else he could do ."
8536,i'm not sure he cares that much about his own children ...
8537,in this state at this time it is highly likely that's not on his mind at all .
8538,never underestimate the insanity of a power addict . if the donbass offensive fails or the war starts taking too long i could see putler deploying tactical nukes . if ww3 somehow starts he'll definitely do it once the russian army gets lolstomped by nato in a week . history shows power addicts rather go out in flames than letting go of the power .
8539,"if you were strictly talking about icbms then maybe , but a tactical nuke could have a very similar output as of the moab .. they have a far lower yield ."
8540,"even if russia used nuclear weapons in a very limited capacity and somehow that did not trigger a nuclear war . it would prompt , at the very least , a land grab and massive multi-national invasion of russia . op is right . russia would be chopped up faster than it could retaliate as literally the entire world would be clamoring to gain control over whatever nuclear arsenal it had left . that said its equally as likely a nuclear war would erupt very quickly . the us , as a general rule , has basically automated its defensive nuclear strategy . so , if somehow a full on nuclear war is triggered you can bet the entire war will last a matter of something like 6 hours . the ideals behind seizing initiative in preventing a more deadly subsequent wave will have basically predetermined the outcome . each side is essentially praying the other stalls their retaliation long enough that their next wave will destroy the others arsenal before it can be launched ."
8541,"if they don't know about chernobyl , i am not assured that they understand that the destruction is mutually assured ."
8542,when you attack nato yes . not so sure that nato would retaliate against an attack on ua
8543,"putin will use them if he loses he stated specifically that if russia goes down , they are taking the whole world with them ."
8544,lost too many troops ? 7k-15k out of 900k is too big of a loss to encircle something ?
8545,take that orcs
8546,"yes,we invaded iraq illegally and since the iraq invasion,at least 500,000 iraq civilians were killed . remember when gw said "" mission accomplished "" aboard that aircraft c arrier ?? by that point , after we bombed the fuck out of bagdahd for three days already 100,000 civilians killed ( of course , these statistics aren't proven ) anyhow no weapons of mass destruction in iraq . and no neo - nazis in kyiv sounds similar , and americans were hating on muslims already from 911 so there wasn't much opposition anyhow yes,we have invaded . and let's not talk about how vietnam was an opium war ! whole new story! "
8547,fyi russia was a superpower . they're a near peer now . russia lost its superpower status when the soviet union collapsed .
8548,sad but true
8549,yes they would . 100 %
8550,why do we have to remember that ?
8551,"the fact the us are the only ones to drop it is because of the mad pact . all of life would end when somebody drops one . nuclear winter is not a joke and would make a giant apocalypse . after the nukes in ww2 everybody realized how horrible that shit is . and besides that , the nukes nowadays are 100x as powerful as the hiroshima and nagasaki nukes . bro watch this before commenting again all life would end , stop spreading this shit . edit : no matter your political views , people you hate ( doesn't matter which side ) nobody wants a nuclear war . it will fuck over the lives of everybody you know in the worst way over , including your future children and the children of everybody you know . it is insanely messed up what kind of damage it will do ."
8552,why does the west dropping the first nuke matter ?
8553,correct - but that also could trigger an article 5 afaik ukraine is already getting power from the eu power grid to bolster their damaged parts . so an emp could have an impact on european infrastructure and nato countries .
8554,"could make things worse , too if the bombs explode too close to the ground , they leave orders of magnitude more radioactive material behind ."
8555,"i agree , but lets get really cavalier a moment nuclear war is a losing proposition for everyone , but its even more of a losing proposition for russia . russia doesnt need to launch nukes in order to wipe out all life . this is a military power which actively targets civilians and civilian infrastructur , uses cyber warfare to interfere with and extort hospitals and electrical grids , expertly uses infowar to destabilise societies , and suavely bribes politicians in order to get favourable foreign policy . as a sweet maraschino cherry bonus , russia uses the threat of nukes as a deterrent against bystanders wanting to stop russia from raping and murdering children . many of russias nukes probably only exist on paper , the budget having been pocketed years ago , but thats somewhat irrelevant cause they do have nukes . but the western powers are probably somewhat able to interdict some of the nukes . russia has fewer cities of measure , and really the western powers only need to nuke one city in russia . and in the event russia nukes the west , the west is more likely to come together to rebuild , whilst russia , being the belligerent that started this holocaust , wont have many friends to call on when they try to rebuild . russia knows they cant survive war with nato . russia only demands no further countries join nato because once those countries do , they effectively become nuclear powers russia cannot touch . as silly as i sound , russia is the isolated big bad villain on a hyperstyalised 1980s action tv show who uses cheap suited goons to shake down innocent townspeople . what we need is mr t to roll in with his crew to punch them out . and if we can work in a talking car , all the better ."
8556,"meaning we ( over here , in some kind of freedom ) can make sure ukraine wins this and drive pooptins dogs of war back over their own border . than befriend an alternative communazi regime ; back to business as usual as quickly as possible ."
8557,"not true , there is such a thing as tactical nukes and governing doctrines proving you wrong ."
8558,or literally anyone else .
8559,"listen to artist "" sting "" composition "" russians "" written when the iron curtain fell in ' 92"
8560,i think this is accurate but i have some hope that some of the russian people wont let this happen
8561,i think the nuke call has to pass multiple people after putin though so lets hope someone isnt that stupid
8562,"i was discussing today about the recent video of putin with a dr friend of mine . i felt he was in pain due to the grimacing he was doing and she felt he has parkinsons and was holding the table to stop the shaking which only happens at rest . he might have lewy body like robin williams . i feel though that if he has parkinsons and his mind is presently intact then there is little reasons for his inner circle to take him out . it has been suggested if he gets mariupol , and then moves onto odessa , then there is the russian enclave in moldova . noise has been made that was his intention to take over that territory . that would engage nato immediately . he has moved troops in the past years up to the border of the baltic states and then brought them back . is he playing chicken ? it seems evident from this disaster in ukraine that the russian army is not up to the task . more importantly the work in the background regarding sanctions that include countries like switzerland implies that for some time powers that be have been reaching out to all to get a united front against russia or more specifically putin . killing russians in other countries is so offensive . bill broder has done a wonderful job to get the magnitsky act accepted around the world . i feel given the interviews on the street with russians that there might be enough people who would accept full democracy . open borders and allowing travel gave younger people opportunities to see for themselves just what the other side is all about ."
8563,the land grab is the exact reason the nukes would continue to fly .
8564,"i am sensing this is the reason so many doubt my statement . here we are though , no nukes launched , and even russia has stopped saying theyll use them ."
8565,nato would most definitely retaliate if a nuke is used . the fallout alone from one used in the ukraine would land on a nato country thus equaling an attack on it triggering the counter attack . russia knows that and won't use nuclear weapons .
8566,"any nukes fly it wont matter where they go , others will fire nukes at their enemies . its mutually assured destruction because nobody is waiting to find out so they launch their nukes at their enemies as well . thats the same scenario its always been ."
8567,we just fight russia on ukraine soil . when russians get sick of a few clods they can try our bitch system and let a flow of talent and ideas flow though the administration . how did he believe we're nazis . his threats are worth anger .
8568,"latest estimates are well over 22k and they only committed about 90-100k to the table to begin with . thats almost a quarter of your army . half their fighting tanks are dead now . they still cant establish air superiority , their men are demoralized and afraid to fight , the west is literally pouring weapons , artillery , ammunition , drones , and aircraft in faster than russia can replace theirs ... yeah . it's gonna be a tough time for them to do much of anything ."
8569,"you're forgetting one key thing about war it takes between 4 and 10 people not in combat to support a single soldier in combat . logistics support fire support medical personal cooks etc . but lets break down the numbers 600k of them are not combat troops at all . out of the 900k , 300k are rosgvardiya and can't be used in combat they're already being used to suppress dissent internally all of the ones that can be sent have been which is less than 10k , also totally useless because they do not and will not take commands from the military only putin . 150k are vks(thats the airforce ), so not ground combat and another 150k is navy , not marines just ship dudes so also not ground combat . about 50-80k are in the strategic rocket forces also not deployable . that leaves 300k max half of which are conscripts with less than 1 year . so in the end you have about 200k available troops 180k of which were deployed at the beginning . most of those losses they've taken are from professional battalions , combat experienced people who signed up for the military not conscripts . so yes they have lost far too many troops probably 60 % of their combat veterans , something like 50 of their 180 btg's are combat ineffective , either through loss of personal or equipment . that puts their combat effective personal at around 130k they're already outnumbered 2 to 1 in a month it will be 3 to 1 a month after that 4 to 1 , assuming the russians take 0 losses between then and now , the only reason ukraine isn't crushing them is they actually have to defend places even if there aren't russians in the area ."
8570,yes that is my point . the difference ? we took baghdad in 36 days or something like that . russians are having a lot harder time
8571,"the sovjet union was not russia and russia not the su . stalin was from georgia , chrushew from ukraine . people tend to forget that ."
8572,i disagree they have nuclear weapons which makes them a superpower regardless of their economy
8573,1 . the world would survive a low powered nuclear attack . 2 . once you use a nuclear weapon there is no going back . 3 . when the other side has nukes too the world may not survive when there is escalating retaliation .
8574,how does a giant apocalypse compare with a medium apocalypse ?
8575,"is there any evidence that nuclear winter exists ? the us , britain , france , and russia had thousands of nuclear tests in the 1950s . nuclear winter didnt show up then . why would it now ?"
8576,i think the implication was that russia never has done it so wont . however...i see it as the opposite ha ing seen the antics during the cold war and space race etc . they may feel like they are owed a nuke or 2 no ?
8577,yeah true but there is a high chance of way more modern defense systems putting it down
8578,"one small flaw in an otherwise good plan and that's he ' ain't going on no plane , fool !"
8579,cool
8580,"exactly . so rather than "" nukes would...put an end to putins regime "", if , because of western arms and ukraine's success , putin's regime is near collapse , he'd willingly use the nuke option . people should be prepared for that . my guess is that ultimately it won't happen . his regime will collapse before he gets the chance . but it may not ."
8581,""" russians "" was published in 85 ! it was recorded somewhere between november 84 and april 85 , during some of the darkest times of the cold war . when it was published in june gorbatchev had just been elected the secretary general 11 weeks before ."
8582,"you mean the one who were busy writing and painting "" z "" symbols ? p.s i have much respect for russian anti war protesters but they were few compare to whole russian population ."
8583,""" i have some hope that some of the russian people wont let this happen "" this is what i think would happen . war protestors are few but putin's war is so incredibly stupid that its impossible for a large proportion of the population to truly support it . so many russians have been needlessly slaughtered at the front , sent to die to protect the wealth of putin and his elite . how many people really don't get that ? they ain't that dumb ."
8584,"people are losing touch with the lesson of hiroshima and nagasaki . for decades after , people actually thought nuclear war was winnable . images from ww2 were the only rebuttal some people could grasp . trump wanted to nuke a hurricane . people reject vaccines in the face of preventable death . russian death cult says things like "" if it happens , it happens "" i am not sure mad will keep working . even though it's there in plain view ."
8585,it's ' ukraine ' and not ' the ukraine ' consider supporting anti-war efforts in any possible way : [[ help 2 ukraine ]( [[ merriam-webster ]( [[ bbc styleguide ]( ^( beep boop im a bot )
8586,"strongly disagree , there is a bigger chance nato wont do anything if russia uses nuclear weapons in ukraine"
8587,what if some country has nuke defenses not publicly known
8588,"it's actually a bit different these days , as slbm's are really the most important part of the "" triad "". the most dangerous period was earlier in the cold war during the land-based icbm days . at that time , the thinking was that the aggressor could land lots of nukes on your silos to soften the blow from a counter-attack , meaning it was necessary to get your nukes off the ground before they were destroyed by your enemy . these things take about 30 minutes to reach their targets flying over the north pole and would only be detected by radars staring ceaselessly into outer space about 15 minutes before impact , so your entire military apparatus had to be geared to go from zero to all missiles launched in that amount of time . literally global destruction on a hair trigger 24/7 . on top of that , guidance systems weren't as accurate so you couldn't guarantee a direct hit , so you'd use monster multi-megaton bombs capable of blasting mile-diameter craters a hundred plus feet into the ground . ground bursts like this would be sufficient to collapse any silos within a mile or so from ground zero at each location . these days , the us , russian , and british ( at the very least ) arsenals include something like a thousand nuclear warheads silently cruising beneath ocean waves at random undisclosed locations around the globe , so even if your first strike was effective at eliminating all of the enemy's land-based missiles and bombers , you have to worry about full blown thermonuclear retaliation regardless . this provides less incentive for a massive early strike and makes putting your strategic forces on a hair trigger less useful . it's possible for it to turn into a protracted thermonuclear slugfest that slowly escalates and/or de-escalates ."
8589,"22k is the highest ukrainian propaganda estimate and is about as much bullshit as russias claim of 3k or whatever theyre saying now . the west arming ukraine only helps to a certain extent seeing as ukraine is vastly outmanned . all those guns mean nothing when theres no one to hold them . another thing russia has that ukraine doesnt is time . they can ease up and basically besiege all of eastern ukraine and some of the major cities to the west as well , for much longer than the west is willing to help out with this indirect support ."
8590,not reading all that shit lmao
8591,"yes but we stuck around for few years as "" advisers "" and a lot of car bombings and militants were taken out talk about job security,halliburton got rebuild contract and feeding the troops ! yes,they not only get minimum wage,but our brave soldiers also had to pay for their meals ! and halliburton supplied them i read a letter from a wife who was asking why uncle sam was taking money out of her husband's small monthly check that was being sent back to her and their children , that sickens me , it's no wonder soldiers were comitting suicide up to two a week when they get home together we stand divided we fall "
8592,"true , russia and the soviet union aren't the same . russia was part of the soviet union , so it is reasonable to say that russia lost its superpower status when the soviet union collapsed because it was no longer part of a superpower nation ."
8593,or they never knew it
8594,idk all people i know including family members who grew up in the soviet union in certain other countries consider themselves russian ie kazakhstan moldova etc
8595,"israel has nuclear weapons . is it a superpower ? india and pakistan have nuclear weapons . are they superpowers ? russia has 1/20th or less now the conventional ( read : non-nuclear ) forces of nato alone . every war they've "" won "" in the past 50 years has involved the wide-spread use of chemical weapons coupled with scorched earth tactics that turned cities like grozny and mariupol to rubble . russia is not a superpower . they are failing to take a weak , dismembered and notoriously corrupt country right next door that has 1/10th or less of russia's conventional forces . and getting their asses kicked for trying . the fact that putin has to consider a chemical or nuclear attack on ukraine speaks volumes of the failure of the russian military ."
8596,"i think a better choice of words is a super threat , not a superpower . pakistan and north korea are not superpowers . superpower means economically top tier . but feel free to use the language as you choose . however , it is confusing when most of us see the word as having a much greater meaning ."
8597,"literally no amount of nukes can ever make a country a superpower . any use of nukes is inherently self defeating because there would be retaliation from other countries creating a situation where launching nukes ends up being functionally like suicide . you end up dead . you can't wield power , let alone be a super power , if you're dead . so any nuclear arsenal is only a factor in determining military strength , but will never be sufficient for declaring a nation as a super power . being a superpower , by definition , requires having great military strength , economic strength , and political power . they are getting their ass kicked by a much smaller military . their economy was ranked below south korea and is on its way to being ranked below poland - neither of which are superpowers . they're now ostracized politically , so not very strong politically either ."
8598,and where does a small apocalypse fit in ?
8599,"> those tests were done over time , thus spread out over a longer time frame . a nuclear war would concentrate thousands of nukes in the span of days . the dust from these would effectively blot out the sun , causing deep and prolonged winters ... killing crops and livestock .... some may wish to argue the possibility of nuclear winter , but the insidious killer is the fallout . not to mention emps and the destruction of any unprotected electronics . life would become extremely difficult for those who survive . i laugh at all the doomsday preppers who have spent thousands of $$$ in an attempts to survive on a post-nuclear war earth . it will be a dismal existence , if they last long in the first place ."
8600,"those tests were prepared in such a way as to minimize harmful effects . most of them were done deep underground or under water , for example ."
8601,they aren't owed a nuke or 2
8602,mr ts going to need his milk cocktail !
8603,"the whole point is that psychology calculus needed to make an accurate prediction here involves more than a few wild ass guesses . even for those whove spent whole careers studying putin and russian politics . the sobering reality is that were as close as weve ever come to nuclear war . anyone confidently saying were not is probably just distancing themselves from that reality to avoid the anxiety of it . i cant blame them . even willful ignorance can be a relief . i just pray that those with the capacity to steer our societies generally understand the situation weve found ourselves in . so far , so good ."
8604,necroing thread but putin would probably call mad a victory
8605,in any case it is a fitting song for these dark times as well 
8606,its all speculative of course but 45 days later and im fairly certain youre correct . they cant push much further without the perception of their people being absolutely crushed .
8607,"it actually is "" the ukraine """
8608,you're flat out wrong .
8609,you are out of your mind the rules are very clear in nuclear war
8610,it will be the first and only test of no first use policies
8611,thats always possible the pentagon claims all simulations are based on outdated material factoring classified defensive capabilities but it would be a complete catastrophe either way
8612,"not here for a propaganda update . believe what you like , but it's almost impossible to deny that ukraine is defending itself rather well minus the missile attacks . as far as the ground war goes , they are kicking ass . the west will continue arming them almost as if they are our own . they're doing such a damn good job eliminating russians , that the west is almost happy to do it . russia really doesn't have all that much time anyhow . they are getting obliterated and arent going to be able to sustain things much longer than say , 3 or 4 more months . if that ."
8613,casualties and desertions alone are 2-3x that 20k as well
8614,"russia has 3x the population of ukraine ; but ukraine is completely bought in to stop the horde . russia is relying on conscripts , and reservists . the russians havent faced an opponent this resolute since the winter war in finland , 1940 . and ukraine is getting additional weapons ; the russians are losing weapons and personnel at a very high rate ."
8615,"ok keep being stupid then and thinking they have 900k combat troops so they have no pilots , no air craft or vehicle maintenance people , no logistical support , no cooks , no doctors or medics , no navy , and no rocket forces , and no one guarding their borders . which is the most retarded shit i've heard since the start ."
8616,tl:dr - you have no clue what you are talking about and are completely wrong
8617,"yeah , let's make a drone man and post it . then the share holders can have turns driving it . nice people do that ."
8618,russia was considered the center of the su thats why russian was the main language
8619,"yes they are . bc we , the us can't touch them militarily . nukes equal superpower . they are a military superpower ."
8620,"i think your missing the point here . they have nuclear weapons . therefore , they will go unopposed by nato ."
8621,"dprk and pakistan have exponentially fewer nuclear warheads , they have no nuclear triad , and have fewer modern delivery systems relative to russia . theres really no comparison . is russia a superpower ? not anymore really . does that mean that we should downplay their nuclear capabilities ? absolutely not ."
8622,"depends upon whether theyre ground bursts or at air bursts . emp , and fallout will be the main problems ; but any dust clouds will still settle to earth in accordance with physics . not that i want to experience nuclear war , since i live in close proximity to several prime targets . i just doubt the claims of the nuclear winter hypothesis . the dinosaur killer 65 million years ago was far more energy than mankinds collective nuclear arsenal ."

8630,rules are only rules until they are broken .
8631,"between two nuclear powers , yes"
8632,unless you are american
8633,you do know that russia has an enormous military of which 90 % is not yet in ukraine right ? its not like if ukraine destroys all the tanks russia sent that there are no more tanks
8634,the world is going to be more consern about production and stocks of weapons russia just changed tactics due to circumstances . so now a new difficulty for ukraine . but others have been threatened in a crass way .
8635,sure they are bud . why would any government ever lie about how well theyre doing in a war ?
8636,"theyre not relying on conscripts, there are conscripts there but they dont make up a very large portion of the russian forces by anyones estimate . russia is losing weaponry thats in ukraine . dont forget that they have massive stockpiles they can transfer into ukraine within hours or days . putin is absolutely the type of leader to just keep throwing shit at ukraine until it falls . this isnt a sustainable conflict for either side but again , russia has time on its side and ukraine very much does not"
8637,i never said that but ok
8638,serious talent and exparance has chewed though this for 7.999 years .
8639,what the fuck are you talking about
8640,"so again , is north korea , a superpower ? a superpower denotes something beyond the simple citeria you believe it requires , the posession of nuclear weapons . the ability to project militry strength globally ( us is unmatched ). russia support kleptocratic and other failed state nations that make poor trading partners and less reliable allies . the us operates nato backstopping security and peace for 70 + years on the european continent . it operates various security pacts with countries such as australia , canada and others to promote free trade and the peace and security necessary for global commerce and trade . the size and resiliency of its economy ( us is again unmatched ). in this realm only china rivals the united states in terms of the size of the us economy in the near or distant future . russia is nowhere near either . its economy rivals that of tiny italy today , and less given the events of 2014-2022 +. coupled with its international reach ( culture , achievements in science , its cultural exports ) here again the us dominates but it is strongly being again challenged by both rivals and friends . it is fair to say however that european cooperation ( the eu european space agency - esa for example ) coupled with that of the united states ' nasa has humanity on the actual roadmap to colonization of the solar system . whereas the russian space agency is in turmoil , soyuz as dead-ended as much as the shuttle was . russia is 20 + years behind and doesn't have the cash to fund development of new heavy lift rockets given sanctions . china is at best 8-10 years behind the us in space technology ."
8641,"nobody disputes that they have nukes , but you're missing the fact that having nukes is not enough to qualify as a superpower . a superpower nation , by definition must have great military , economic , and political power . they're getting their asses handed to them in ukraine - a much smaller , far less established military . not exactly demonstrating great military strength . their economy prior to invading ukraine had been ranked below that of south korea ( south korea is not considered a superpower ). now they've been cut off from most of the world economy and are cooking the books to keep afloat . the russian economy will completely collapse before long . they're no longer going to be in the top 20 , which means that they'll be ranked below poland ( currently 20 ). so definitely doesn't have great economic strength . they've been ostracized in international politics so they really don't qualify as having great political power . they fail on all three metrics that qualify a country as a superpower . words have meaning . you can't call a nation a superpower simply because they have nukes . go ahead and say that nato doesn't want to fight them because they have nukes , just don't call them a superpower . nobody disagrees with the point that nato doesn't want to fight them because of the nukes - hell , they've said that themselves . but by the same token , nobody is interested in fighting the nuclear armed countries of pakistan or north korea either , but those countries aren't superpowers either . as for the us not being able to touch them militarily - that's laughable . the number 1 most powerful military in the world is the us air force . the second most powerful military is the us navy . the fourth is the us army aviation and the fifth is the us marine corps . the sixth is india . now , the third was the russian air force , but given that they can't achieve air superiority over a nation that ranks 38th and keep having their tanks hauled away by farmers , it seems like they may have slipped a bit . we're using ukraine as a proxy for military activity right now . the us is pouring a shitload of weapons into ukraine which helps to weaken russia . the us doesn't need to engage directly with russia to get the desired result - that's because the us has power and is able to weaken russia indirectly because of it . russia understands that the us is impacting them which is why they sent an official diplomatic notice to stop supporting ukraine and threatened the us if they didn't stop . the us response ? increased funding and weapons for ukraine . that's because russia isn't a threat to the us , despite their nukes . that's because russia is not a superpower though the us is ."
8642,"i don't think anybody is downplaying their nuclear capabilities so much as refuting the incorrect association of russia as being a superpower . some seem to think that having nukes should be equated with being a superpower . russia as over 6000 nukes . that's an obscene number of horrific weapons . even if you focus on nukes as being a source of power , having 6000 or 6 million won't matter . literally no number of nukes is enough to qualify a country as a superpower because at this point the use of nukes is going to be self defeating as there would be immediate retaliation that wouldn't be survivable ; launching nukes today is functionally suicide . you can't wield power if your dead , so being nuclear armed isn't enough to ever be a superpower ."
8643,your doubt is but a droplet of water to the vast ocean that is the research and conclusion of the scientific community on the subject
8644,"my "" done over time "" comment concerns the dust from massive nuclear explosions and the consequences of a nuclear winter . however , i believe the same can apply to fallout , too . a lot at once vs . the test explosions over a 80 year period . regardless , nuclear war is bad news . i hope i get vapourized in an initial explosion ."
8645,"every simulation and analysis of a modern day nuclear launch , regardless of target , results in a mad scenario eventuating . those sims aren't by armchair enthusiasts , but experts in their fields ( including the highest levels of national agencies ). the biggest problem is that putin is in his twilight years , is unwell and is increasingly detatched from reality ( according to analysts ). throw into the mix a country with severe sanctions and a deteriorating economy ; that's a nasty mix for a person with his finger on the button . the last time we cornered an animal that was leading an ultranationalist party with economic sanctions , we ended up with ww2"
8646,any fallout that lands on nato soil would be seen as an attack
8647,nato is a nuclear power if they feel the effects of a nuke so will russia thats just the sad reality
8648,"you do know that russia is a massive country with very long borders that it wants to protect and would never use all it has in ukraine . putin is so scared of nato that he would never use everything he has on ukraine . on top of that , the tanks he may have put back are mostly soviet era and most likely have not been maintained for nearly 2 decades . rusted junk mostly ."
8649,"those russian stockpiles of equipment have been rusting for 40 years . theyre running out of missiles ; theyre losing aircraft on a daily basis . the troops still in the field are poorly trained . the west can keep sending arms until russia rots from the inside . and thats the goal : complete and total russian defeat , and the collapse of russia and civil war . let the russian federation nuke themselves once they lose in ukraine ."
8650,"yeah you did should i quote you ? i'm gonna quote you > lost too many troops ? 7k-15k out of 900k here you mention the 900,000 number talking of total military personnel which is correct . > you do know that russia has an enormous military of which 90 % is not yet in ukraine right ? here you imply that russia could deploy even more troops talking about the 90 % still not deployed which is also wrong since they sent 180,000 which would leave around 70 % of their military uncommitted . your implication being all those 900k are combat troops which isn't even close to the case and almost none of those can be deployed to combat at all . russia is fully committed unless they're willing to pull troops from critical defensive positions like kaliningrad moscow or saint petersburg"
8651,"i agree that russia is no longer a superpower . but when the user above compared them to north korea and pakistan , yes , that comparison downplays russian nuclear capability ."
8652,ha yes the rusted junk tanks meme . its just propaganda my guy . yes russias tanks are old but many of them have been modernized .
8653,"eh sure some of their equipment is old but the idea that theyre totally useless and outdated as a military is just western propaganda . people think that russian stockpiles are mostly just old soviet shit , which some of it is , but they left most of the shitty stuff in ex soviet countries when the ussr fell . one of putins main goals during his rule has been to modernize the military , and he has done that ."
8654,"literally never implied all 900k were combat infantry , and your entire argument ( i think , i didnt read it ) is based on that statement that you pulled out of your ass ."
8655,"is everything just propaganda and memes for you ? haha . seems like every point i make to you is either a joke or a lie for you . either way , you or i know nothing about anything going on it seems and i have made my predictions . so i guess we will just see who is right at the end of it and who isn't ."
8656,no they haven't
8657,"they added a few new high tech modern bits of kit and handed them out to the bits of the army we see on parades . it does look like there wasn't a massive across the board upgrade , just enough for the cameras and press reports . many of the elite teams were sent in early to capture airports and overthrow the government were beaten back or destroyed . there is no super secret elite army waiting to be deployed , there is just putins private guard sitting on their thumbs in moscow ."
8658,"i love how nonchalant arnold isjust ive seen you do better ukraine , hit him harder. "
8659,why is arnold there
8660,the us wearing a us patch is perfectly in character .
8661,russia struggling against ukraine is like us in ww2 struggling against hungary
8662,"as funny as this is , i don't like nato being equated to logan paul ."
8663,lol the bald dude filming should be poland
8664,lets not pretend that ukraine has it easy though . the war is absolutely horrible for both sides .
8665,yup i agree

8670,arnold is the teacher who knows what the pupil is capable of
8671,america is non chalant because they also drew up the defensive battle plan for ukraine to follow and knew it worked even now thinking about the beginning of the war and how ukraine gave russia a bloodied nose makes me smile inside

8674,dunno . i feel like there should be some fireworks in there too .
8675,or like russia struggling against finland . or afghanistan . or japan .
8676,make him germany and make the eu be nato and the problem is fixed .
8677,"it is horrible for both sides . ukraine is hiding its casualty numbers , and for good reason - it would demoralize the country to hear the full carnage . i feel for the ukrainian soldiers on the front line , who are suffering from combat fatigue because they cant rotate with anyone else . but hats off to their bravery and courage ."
8678,"us/uk/canada has been openly ukraine since 2015 , training them for this kind of war . we were sending them javelins in since 2018 because we always assumed it was going to be an insurgent/guerilla war ( hence wanting to air evac zelensky out of ukraine ). hell , ukrainians started using the same tactics the taliban gave us a bloodied nose in afghanistan . don't think that's a coincidence !"
8679,everyone love watching russians get bitch slapped .
8680,does seem weird . i know he loves bodybuilding and mma but i wasn't aware of any other sports he was big into .
8681,well soviet union but yea
8682,did russia/soviet union ever not struggle in a war ?
8683,japan was a serious military power though .
8684,he's a twat
8685,"he went to japan , to a forest where a lot of people kill themselves and decided to go fullblown vlogging tourists trash when he found a man who hanged himself there ."
8686,"absolutely . but its also understandable that the russians do the same . their motives are less heroic , but the strategy is similar ."
8687,so a combination of combined arms for the initial push inside ukraine and gorilla tactics for the rear support lines
8688,afghanistan was a training op to gain top tier guerilla warfare data . natos collecting all the warfare expertise like infinity stones .
8689,"this unexpected weakness of russia in military matters arises from four concurring causes , of which three are inherent in her system , and , if not absolutely incurable , are at least little likely to be cured . in the first place , the nature of the country and the want of roads . her resources may be vast but they are scattered and remote . her forces may be immense , but they are necessarily in great measure distant from the scene of action . [ ] secondly . the russian armies are often armies on paper only . not only are their numbers far fewer than are stated in returns and paid for out of the official purse , but they are notoriously ill-provided with everything necessary to the action of a soldier . the colonels of regiments and officers commissariat have a direct interest in having as large a number on the books and as small a number in the field as possible inasmuch as they pocket the pay and rations of the between these figures . they have an interest also in the men being as inadequately fed and clothed as possible inasmuch they pocket the difference between the sum allowed and the sum expended on the soldiers rations and accoutrements . the emperor provides ( or believes he does ) for the food , clothing , lodging , arms and ammunition of 5 or 600,000 men ; but every one of these who is or can be made non-existent is worth two or three hundred roubles to some dishonest official or officer ; every pair of shoes or great coat intercepted from the wretched soldier is a bottle of champagne for the ensign or the major ; every ammunition waggon which is paid for by government , but not provided , is a handsome addition to the salary of the captain or the contractor . robbery and peculation of this sort is universal , in every rank , in every district , in every branch . it runs through every department in the empire ; and its operation upon the efficiency of the military service may be easily imagined and cannot be easily exaggerated . this horrible and fatal system originates in two sources both , we fear , nearly hopeless , and certainly inherent in russian autocracy; the rooted dishonesty of the national character . and the incurable inadequacy of despotic power . cheating , bribery , peculation pervade the whole tribe of officials , and are , in fact , the key-note and characteristic of the entire administration . there seems to be no conscience , and not much concealment , about it . the officers are ill paid , and of course pay themselves . regard for truth or integrity has no part in the russian character . we have heard those who know them well say that there are only three honest men in the empire: woronzow is one , nesselrode another and men differ about the name of the third . we have heard statesmen , who strongly incline towards a muscovite alliance , say that the russians are liars above all things : it is their spcialit . then the power of the autocrat , absolute as it is and vigorously as it is exercised , is utterly insufficient to meet the evil . what can a despot do who has no instruments that can be trusted ? there is no middle class who pay the taxes and insist upon knowing how they are expended . there is no free press , with its penetrating and omniscient vigilance , to compel honesty and drag offenders to light and retribution . there is only one eye over all : and that eye can of course see only a small corner of this vast empire . what the emperor looks at , or can visit , is well done : everything else is neglected or abused . it is the common and inevitable story wherever you have centralisation and barbarism combined . thirdly . the common soldiers , brave and hardy as they are , devoted to their czar , and careless of privation , have no love for their profession , and no interest in the object of the war . if we except the household regiments , who are near the person of the emperor , the russian private has no zeal for glory , no taste for fighting , no pleasure in bold and exciting enterprises . he is serf , seized by the conscription , and condemned to hopeless slavery for life . he is torn from his family and his land , drilled by the knout , neglected by his officers , fed on black bread , where fed at all , always without comforts , often without shoes . how can such troops be expected to make head, we do not say against french enthusiasm , we do not say against british resolution , we do not say against fanatical and hardy mountaineers , like schamyl and his warriors , but even against courageous well fed turks , fighting for their country and their faith , and officered by competent commanders ? we need not wonder to read that at oltenitza and silistria the russians had to be on to the assault with menaces and blows ; that general had to sacrifice their lives in an unprecedented manner in order to encourage the soldiers to make head against the foe ; and that the prisoners of war begged as a mercy to be permitted to enlist in the army that had captured them rather than return to misery by being exchanged . lastly . there is another source of weakness in the russian empire . that vast state is in a great measure composed of spoils which she has torn from surrounding nations . she is a patchwork of filched and unamalgamated materials . her frontier provinces are filled with injured , discontented , hostile populations , whom , being unable to reconcile to her rule , she has endeavoured to enfeeble and to crush ; and many of whom wait , with more or less of patience and desire , the blessed day of emancipation and revenge . since the great roman empire probably , no state ever enfolded so many bitter enmities within its embrace , or was girt with such a circle of domestic foes . now these three last sources of russian weakness are perennial . they belong to her as a despotism as a centralised administration , as an empire formed by conquest and unconsolidated and unsecured by conciliation . until , therefore , her whole system changed ; till an honest middle class has been created ; till her government be liberalised and de-centralised ; till a free press be permitted and encouraged to unveil and denounce abuses ; and till the rights and feelings of annexed territories be habitually respected , we do not think that russia need henceforth be considered as formidable for aggression . she has been unmasked ; it will be the fault of europe if it dreads her , or submits to be bullied by her , any longer . full article :"
8690,"that doesnt sound to me like the kind of asshole germany is . lol . theyre more like the manager in office space or something . if anything logan paul is the kind of asshole that the us is , because he really hits all the notes of the asshole american stereotype afaik ( and of course he is one of us like it or not ) overly loud , overconfident , young , thinks hes cool , rich for no reason , always getting involved in others business and ever so culturally insensitive !"
8691,"yeah , nato usually doesn't upload footage of dead bodies themselves , they wait for wikileaks to do it for them ."
8692,"true , were in the fog of war for sure when it comes to casualty numbers . but other than the occasional sucker punches , all the advantages are with russia . and ukraine has much less to draw from the russia does . the big bear just lumbers forward . time favours one side it seems ."

8695,"and yet we still get republicans claiming this whole thing was biden's fault since "" this wouldn't have happened on trump's watch "". in reality , this had been in planning for years , and if trump had been in power , ukraine wouldn't have had a fraction of the support they've enjoyed so far ."
8696,"what the hell is his problem ? i seriously have never understood this guy , but this is too far ."
8697,weak man's idea of a strong man . poor man's idea of a rich man . stupid man's idea of a smart man .
8698,"trump and a group of republicans have taken a stance that anything biden or the dems and even some republicans are behind has to evoke an opposite response . there is no reasoning or pragmatism in their approach , they are about winning and not the better good of america or the world it lives in . it's insane that people in america will side with complete evil ( aka : russia , north korea , iran , etc ) over a free world . jesus christ , what kind of gratefulness are they showing to every veteran that ever served ? for fuck sake , there are no americans even fighting in the ukrainian/russian war . this is how fucked up the republican party and trump have become . honestly , the biden administration domestically is entirely benign . i can't think of anything they really have done that would offend a republican other than existing . the war will be over before the next election . either because eastern europe will be dragged into it or the ukrainians will have destroyed the russian conventional military . thankfully for the first time in my life i'm happy the pentagon and military industrial complex is running the country . disclaimer : republican ( but a normal one ) that won't vote for trump ."
8699,ok doj . get off your ass . don't let the da in georgia beat you to it .
8700,"trump has always been putins boy , so no surprise ."
8701,trump was only right about rest of nato needing to pitch in(looking at you germany ) but everything else he says is bollocks .
8702,should be already in jail .

8706,"this is bad news for ukraine since he's still the top contender for the gop nomination . ukraine will be doomed if he regains power ( implying that the war is protracted ). his supporters literally started booing as soon as he mentioned ukraine ( they absolutely hate ukrainians ). the good news is that the murdoch media empire is dumping his ass and endorsing the jan . 6 committee , which means that they may pick another gop nominee . let's see if fox will follow the wsj and the nyp by turning on him ( they interviewed liz cheney earlier today ). the murdoch clan may pick a ukraine-friendly republican to anoint him or her as the next gop nominee .

8709,"at the start of the invasion , i was so grateful this fool was not our president as i felt there was a legit possibility that he would have been sending weapons to russia . this does nothing to make me feel otherwise . he's a truly awful human and anyone that supports him needs to splash some water on their face and get out of the cult ."
8710,trump is a fucking idiot .
8711,agent orange .
8712,russian asset who dreams of being putin
8713,fuck you trump
8714,that would be due to his being a russian asset and a giant piece of human garbage
8715,breaking : treasonous cunt says more treasonous things .
8716,"trump said that europe should pay more towards supporting ukraine ; as a european taxpayer , i agree with him . the us has donated at least twice the amount of funding to ukraine as the european union , for example . he did not criticise support for ukraine , as the headline of this thread suggests ."
8717,"okay okay . while i am not a president biden fan , i am also not a trump fan . i agree we need to work on the national debt , but not at the cost of sovereign nation losing everything . i truly hope he doesn't run again , but he probably will with the republican support . this is why i'm a stanuch libertarian . honestly biden gas only does a few things that i don't like , and you should never 100 % agree with any political figures ."
8718,he doesnt want russia to release the peepeetapes 
8719,"the article translated , doesn't say what the title implies ... also neither is the video ... he keeps repeating the same stuff he has been repeating for the past months that "" the war would've never started with him in presidency "" and "" nato countries were not paying their dues ""... i am sorry but everyone here is brainwashed ?"
8720,"> the united states allocates much more money to ukraine than europe . this was said by the 45th president of the united states , donald trump , at the turning point usa student conference in florida , which was broadcast on youtube . > he estimated the total costs for ukraine at more than $ 60 billion . european countries , which were most affected by the full-scale war with the russian federation , gave a tiny part of this amount , trump added . i mean , hes not wrong . the us is the only country really stepping up to support ukraine financially , even when other nato powerhouses have the ability to help more ( germany ). hes not so much attacking nato , but rather the members of nato who have done so little to support them . the headline is sensationalist , and the commenters arent reading the article . per the usual . i dont know whats worse : trump representing this country at any level , or the people who blindly trust any clickbait article they scroll by . i mean its still trump , but not by much"
8721,"well , there is alot of truth in his statement . the eu should support ukraine more . a few are , many aren't . this is a world issue , and a european issue . some european countries need to pony up , and help alot more ."
8722,"would be great if people would read the article ( translate it first with google ) and see what the man actually said , before spouting a bunch of emotional responses . what he actually said is that europe should be doing more . hes not wrong ."
8723,"the title is not supported by the article . trump said : > i think the european union should worry about this problem more than the states . we have $ 35 trillion in public debt , we have financial problems , and we are withdrawing money frankly , i agree , but we should also be assisting extensively . all hands on deck ... but most european countries have done comparatively little despite being so close to the action . the eu membership fast track is great and all , but the hesitation to send weapons despite claiming to be willing to do so ( looking at you germany !) is frankly infuriating . this is the one area where i think biden is doing well . > russia would never have launched an attack , we had great achievements in the level of armaments . with me , there would definitely be no war frankly , this is possible . putin started preparing the invasion the moment trump lost reelection . of course , putin learned very quickly not to judge a man by his political perception , biden responded in a way putin did not anticipate . putin was worried because he didn't know what trump would do .. he thought biden would be obama 2.0 and is paying a heavy price for that mistake ."
8724,"misleading headline . people should actually read the translated article . hes complaining that we ( us ) are providing most of the aid ( certainly the most impactful aid like javelins , 400 + military satellites , himars , harpoons , phoenix ghosts ) while the most affected countries ( those in the eu ) are paying/providing much less aid . which is a 100 % true fact . just take the pathetic amount of aid that the biggest eu economy ( germany ) has provided , on a per capita basis , in comparison to the us . trump has been right about this unfairness for a long time . proof : if germany had listened to him at that time , then : ( 1 ) they wouldnt now be captive to russian gas ; and ( 2 ) theyd have more to contribute than a measly dozen howitzers and some other miscellaneous stuff as an american trump-leaning voter paying for most of the ukrainian aid , i dont mind supporting ukraine . in fact , id like to see it tripled . but i do get pissed off that supposed nato allies like germany ignored trump when he explicitly warned against russian gas years ago ( and sanctioned nordstream2 ). and now germany is undermining usa efforts by sending billions per week to war criminal putin to finance his military ."
8725,"donald trump , go fuck yourself"

8728,russkies having meltdowns is as common as an australian finding a snake or spider .
8729,could someone post a translation of the article ? this sounds misleading
8730,"i read the linked article . it seems trump is not ranting against ukraine aid , but is complaining that the usa , while in large debt itself , is providing much more aid to ukraine than europe . he's urging europe to give more . it seems hardly as described in the post title as a "" rant "", hardly "" against "", and hardly an "" attack "". btw , i'm neither american nor european so am not bothered either way . i just thought clarity around it is better than agitprop ."
8731,"why is everyone saying his a russian asset , he literally fucked with russia more than any president since the cold war , and the article is just him talking about the us giving 60 billion to ukraine while countries in europe don't give anywhere close to that when this war affects them a lot more than it affects the us"
8732,"well this is probably the biggest morale booster putin needed . he's going to hang on now knowing trump is going to help him win . he's just undone all the good of the sanctions , political isolation and even some of the military support trump is a traitor and quite literally an enemy of all freedom loving , western nations and aspiring democracies . period . mcconnell is also a traitor for blocking investigations and protecting him in the senate . they and all the 6 june collaborators in congress and the senate are a shit stain on the sacrifices made by generations of america in the war for independence , civil war and wars of the 20th and 21st centuries . they quite literally have wiped their arse on the constitution . as an australian , please get murdoch and fox/sky too . being an enemy propagandist is just as bad - that guy and his idiots like tucker carlson are today's tokyo rose / axis sally for putin . americans may say , stay out of this as its their country , well this also shits on all the sacrifices of my country fighting against dictators last century too . allowing a proto-dictator into the white house is as calamitous as letting hitler take control from 1933 to 1938 . that is an entire world problem ."
8733,"this must be biting into his "" campaign donations "" from some questionable source that just happens to look like a front for russian intelligence"
8734,"we can rant about trump being a lunatic all we want , but this is an area that concerns me . despite the rallying call of democracy and freedom that ukraine has given to the world , the fact remains in america that higher food and fuel prices are eating into the wallets of your average american , the economy is in recession , and as the saying goes , "" its the economy , stupid ."" which means biden is inevitably headed for political disaster in november and the dems will likely lose in 2024 . in conjunction with whether europe really is prepared to endure this winter without russian gas , western devotion to the ukrainian cause is in question . so i do fear that ukraine is now on a time crunch , that they either have to win or shift the momentum in such a way that is irreversible before the political winds blow against them ."
8735,"another example of reddit being a source of misinformation . trump supports aid to ukraine , what hes upset about is that the us is again carrying the majority of the load . thats what hes always cared about . hes upset that the us is still paying for europes defense even tho europe is more than capable of taking care of themselves now . hes upset the us is still paying the majority of nato while rich nato allies arent even covering their minimum requirements . its smart to post an article in ukrainian in an english sub if your intention is to spread misinformation , but spreading misinformation is not going to help the ukrainians at all ."
8736,trump is putin's bitch
8737,"this alone would guarantee that i would not vote for trump . but , because he was so pathetic as a president . especially so as a world leader , not have voted for him anyway ."
8738,absolutely shocking .
8739,all the more reason why this orange piece of shit shouldnt have a platform .
8740,look up deutsche bank loans to trump and underwriter in cyprus ( which was an oligarch very close to putin )
8741,"once a traitor , always a traitor ."
8742,daddy vlad called and told his little boy to start talking . pathetic
8743,just another reason why he should never be elected to lead anything ever again . i dont care if that is the head of his future prison unit
8744,the litmus test for being a democrat is leaving when you loose the election . trump catastrophically failed . but it is somewhat relieving that the other institutions held . he was bounced by everyone including his own supreme court nominees . trump is the very prototype of bottom of the barrel .
8745,he is a fool .
8746,guess now he's trying to dig the hole further .
8747,lock him up !

8752,trump would let millions die for profits and this is proof .
8753,a russian puppet remains a russian puppet .
8754,im american and wont vote for trump . 
8755,of course the russian asset is against russia's enemies . at what point does sunk cost not justify still supporting this walking crime against humanity ?
8756,"if trump would be in charge , putin would not have invaded ukraine . because trump would have done it first and then gifted it to his sugar daddy putin"

8763,he's just a sausage colored idiot
8764,he is somehow going to become president again . god i hope not . i hope our neighbors south of us have learned .
8765,if you see trump propaganda and look at russian propaganda .. its eerily similar . i have little doubts in my mind that jan 6 was a putin plot .
8766,he is human garbage that abused his office and betrayed the constitution that he took an oath to serve . he is a traitor pure and simple .
8767,fuck trump and his grifting family too
8768,yo . hes so anti america .
8769,still can't believe he's relevant after basically promoting sedition against his own government . musk should have a special spot for him on his mars mission . nowhere on the globe is far enough away .

8813,putins bitch .

8815,ukraine better hope trump doesnt get elected by his mob of retards because the usa will be re-routing the lend-lease weapons to russia instead
8816,putins ugliest mouth piece

8842,"i mean , trump gave afghanistan to the taliban , why wouldn't he give ukraine to the russians ? tfg wasn't exactly a big picture guy ."
8843,trump would have given the weapons aid to russia instead .

8847,its no secret that trump is in bed with putin .
8848,trump would have done what he could to pull the us out of nato . europe as a whole would have been put at risk
8849,it literally would not have happened on trumps watch because putin was perfectly content with watching trump torch the various european alliances and flirt with withdrawing from nato . he was literally carrying out russian foreign policy from the white house . no need to invade ukraine when youre already getting everything you want from the us . utterly disgraceful .
8850,thank god biden is in power
8851,we'd be in ukraine with troops on the ground helping russia if trump was still in charge ..
8852,">"" this wouldn't have happened on trump's watch "". yeah because trump would have sent aid to yknow russia"
8853,""" this wouldn't have happened on trump's watch ."" well yeah , no shit . because he wouldn't have been watching ."
8854,it would not have happend under trump . trump would have sent american troops to ukraine to make sure the rest of nato wouldn't interfer while the russians took kyiv .
8855,"well , trump was the president that gave ukraine lethal aid in the fist invasion ."
8856,"the us sanctioned a shit ton of rich russians . rich russians buy a shit ton of expensive real estate . trumps business is to sell expensive real estate . does that answer your question ? edit : thanks for the rewards guys , but rather donate the money to ukraine !"
8857,hes a russian puppet . that much has been obvious since helsinki .
8858,"trump has no principles of his own , he panders to his far right following because he thinks that will get him elected in 2016 . the dude is a fucking disgrace and is not fit to hold any position of power nevermind president of the united states from a ukrainian perspective , he belongs in prison for what he did to us russian asset piece of shit ."
8859,"in the never-ending torrent of crimes and outrages coming from trump , it's easy to forget that the first time trump got impeached was because he illegally withheld $ 391 million in funds that congress approved to send to ukraine for defense against russia . or the fact that one of the earliest major scandals of the trump administration was when he invited sergei lavrov into the oval office and gave him codeword-clearance intelligence , which came to us from israel and that ended up getting israeli intel operatives killed by isis . every time you read whatever insane shit sergei lavrov is spouting about ukraine , remember that trump was his direct , unfiltered pipeline into everything vladimir putin wanted to know about american policy . that is , or course , when putin is too busy to ask trump himself ."
8860,"a very good question ; almost existential , really . what is donald trumps problem? the best way to understand trump is to do something i wouldnt recommend to anyone : spend daily life with a clinical grade narcissist . not someone a little self-centered whom other people tease about being a little narcissistic . most people have never been around a true , sociopathic narcissist . ( luckily for them ). one thing a true narcissist does is they believe the lies coming out of their mouth . it is jaw dropping to see this in action . its one thing to witness a person lying to benefit themselves in some way . it is quite another to see a person first lie about something , and then consistently go about their day with further statements and actions as if the lie is true , regardless of any and all evidence to the contrary being directly in front of them . in their mind , the lie they concocted to in some way protect their fragile self is literally true . once you have seen that , close up , everything djt does and says makes perfect sense : he literally believes his own bullshit ."
8861,"i'm generally against conspiracy theories , but trump really does come across as a russian asset in the us . there is pretty clear evidence that russia used social media to influence the us election , he immediately tried to pull out of nato , and then tried to seize a second term . i live in canada , but that dude is a russian mole if i've ever seen one ."
8862,"fundamentally trump believes in a world in which might makes right . organizations like nato that allow little countries to stand up to big ones , civil rights or environmental laws that allow powerless people to take on the powerful , the metoo or blm movements , all of this he sees as rewarding weakness . what people miss is that putin doesn't have to have any kompromat on trump . fundamentally they both believe that the strong have a right to prey on the weak ."
8863,"elon musk and trump remind me of each other . trump , though , is especially self-centered , unable to comprehend that other people exist , narcissistic beyond belief , detached from any reality but his own , unable to comprehend consequences . i could go on and on . what a blight on this country ."
8864,"its easy to understand trump . he's a narcist who loves money , power and attention . such people always stick with their own kind ( putin , lukashenko , orban , etc ). they're all criminals who support each other . let's hope that the american people are not silly to re-elect this orange fool again ."
8865,"he was literally placed in power by putin through election rigging and fucking with our media during an election cycle . this is a well known , well documented thing . its not up in the air its objectively proven no matter how hard q followers and trumpies want to say different . read the mueller report it covers everything including the seth rich incident which is unequivocal proof that russia tampered with our elections for trumps benefit . im not saying he went to putin and said put me in power daddy but he also didnt turn down the help when it arrived which is absolutely the most damning evidence that trump never should have ever been anywhere near the presidency , an election or anything to do with american politics . if this was 50 years ago there would be republicans rioting in the streets over trump colluding ( knowingly or just not outing putin to defend our democracy ) with russia . we went from 2 red scares which rocked our country to electing a man who openly loves putin and other tyrants in less than 100 years . bring this up to anyone who supports trump and there is no solid reasoning its always but the dems! we went from divided we fall united we stand to make america great again by electing a literal buffoon just so we can say we won in less than 20 years ."
8866,"trump falls somewhere between being a "" useful idiot "" for russia , all the way up to being a russian asset . i don't think he straight up colluded with them , but he knows they helped him get elected . he has a lot of ties to russia , and he wants to build those ties to benefit himself ."
8867,"russia is losing the war and putin is behind the scenes pulling any lever he can . he still thinks america is only made up of flimsy idiot who believe anything they read online . while thats kind of true to an extent , what putin missed is that the one thing that unites both right and left is a hatred of russia and a newfound love of ukraine"
8868,he got impeached due to the zelenskyy blackmail attempt so he is butt hurt about it .
8869,"what's not to understand ? putin owns him , plain and simple ."
8870,"he's in love , with putin's taint"
8871,> but this is too far . hard to imagine how things in the past weren't too far ...
8872,dont the ruskies have videos of him getting pissed on by hookers ?
8873,"heres the scoop : putin has trump by the balls . russia was set to invade ukraine during trumps presidency , while nato was undermined and the us president was a lapdog . but covid came along and putin had to wait . that changed * everything .*"
8874,"it's that violent , racist part of the american character , read about henry ford , the kkk , this is nothing news , there were lots of nazi sympathizers in ww2"
8875,trump is showing his true colors and so is the republican party .
8876,"the headline is misleading . he's not opposing ukrainian aid , he's railing against the us covering an oversized share of ukrainian aid yet again . believes the eu should be providing more aid the the us rather than a fraction of it . and pointing out again most nato member's failure to adequately fund their militaries as agreed . agree or disagree , but these seem don't seem like irrational opinions ."
8877,this former potus needs to pu tuhs .
8878,"he cannot run on standard policies , since others do it better . he has to run on crazy shit and rile up his idiot supporters that way ."
8879,hes priming the pump for more russian assistance for his 24 election run .
8880,russia probably has video of him in bed with some russian porn star and now he is compromised . thats how russia works . they trap potential high ranking people and then later us that to control them . its called a compromat . not sure exactly what trumps is but pretty sure they have a few
8881,russians saved him from bankruptcy .
8882,"he is a senile , hate filled degenerate ."
8883,he openly admires authoritarian rulers . he even had nice things to say about the tianamen massacre . doesn't matter though - the news echo chambers will make trump sound like he's saying whatever they want him to say . all he has to be is inconsistent and they take care of the rest .
8884,he is a fascist . he wishes to seize total control and power and says anything that he believes will give it to him
8885,putin put him in power and now owns his and his voters asses
8886,papa putin made him shit on ukraines . that is all . hes a good boy and obeys papa .
8887,100 % right on
8888,"oh man , i really wish the whole trump qanon thing hadn't happened . it truly did show me how stupid my family really is . like , believing biden is a demon and trump is the literal saviour . like , literal . and we're not even american :,,("
8889,this is what we used to say about him a few years ago and it's still true .
8890,"never made it as a wise man , couldnt cut as a poor covfefe"
8891,"allegedly on the way to an allied cemetary in normandy he called the soldiers buried there "" a bunch of losers "" because they "" got themselves killed "". trump needs to go . forever ."
8892,"> disclaimer : republican ( but a normal one ) that won't vote for trump . please tell your friends ! the russian wing of the republican party has taken a big hit , but they still obviously exist , led by trump . if he is elected in 2024 , ukraine is fucked , and nato is fucked and the us national security apparatus will also be gutted ."
8893,"to be clear there americans are fighting in ukraine ; however , they are member of the foreign legion and they are there due personal reasons and they exercising that thing called freedom . we still got some laying around here ."
8894,it is rather insane that trump has not been indicted yet .
8895,"in this latest shocking development , the guy who was impeached for illegally holding up $ 400 million in aid for ukraine rants against aid for ukraine ."
8896,what the hell happened at the helsinki meeting with putin where they had a private meeting and trump acted like a beaten dog after ? that was one of the most memorable moments of his presidency and * nobody * has the first clue what occurred .
8897,"right , as a russian loyalist we should expect nothing else we could however treat djt like the traitorous scum he is and give him a new jumpsuit to match his complexion"
8898,have you translated the article ?
8899,"ultimately a failed one . his goal was to block sanctions on russia , break up nato and prevent the west from helping ukraine . he failed at all of those things . his cult may yet destroy the usa , but in the short term - he's been an utter failure ."
8900,depends how you define asset . he's an asset to them in the sense that he supports them as a result of his interest in russian business dealings .
8901,*\* translation of this speech \** dear putin - please give me money ... and intel ... and access to your cyber warfare assets ... pretty please . hugs and kisses from your number one fan . donald j . trump
8902,"not because of any moral failings,but because they know he's damaged goods ."
8903,"this is really good hidden news . remember what happened to crawford when he outlived his usefulness . imagine murdoch and the rest of the republicans pulling the strings decide another candidate is better and fox trots him out , ignoring trump completely . the orange meltdown would be amazing to watch ."
8904,suicide move by gop . if this moron runs again
8905,i am hoping things are largely settled by the time any republican in in charge .
8906,remember what his first impeachment was about ?
8907,"this is not bad news for ukraine , since it hasnt happened , right ?"
8908,"it's possible , but certainly not necessary to explain anything trump has done . trump's russian business dealings are enough to explain his pro-russian behavior . plus the fact that russia helped him win the 2016 election ."
8909,way more toxic than the one used in vietnam .
8910,can you tell me how to translate that page ? i'd like to read what it actually says . thanks .
8911,"> the us has donated at least twice the amount of funding to ukraine as the european union as an american , i'm not sure that's a fair comparison . when you add up eu institutions and member states , it's pretty close ( eu ~ 30 billion , us about ~ 40 billion ). but it's not like california is donating equipment to ukraine . because all donations from the us flow through the federal government , those donations are magnified ."
8912,"kgb/fsb have been known to film powerful westerners staying in russia to either discern secret conversations or film illicit acts to use as kompromat . given trumps rapey behavior towards his own daughter and friendship with epstein , i bet the fsb has footage of him being a pedo and are using it as leverage to get anything they want from him . can you imagine how quickly his world would crumble if they released that footage ? pee pee tapes alone arent enough to explain the wild shit this man has done for putin . he reportedly ate notes from private conversations with russian officials and kicked out his own translator during a meeting with putin in helsinki . this mans in deep . of course . putin will release it anyways when trump is no longer useful ."
8913,"yes , and blatant manipulation in comments + bots regurgitating already disproven lies about the russia collusion bullshit . obama and biden as vp did fuck all for ukraine when they had the chance . also everything trump bitched at nato for has come true . im not even a fan of the dude but holy shit people are idiots"
8914,"> i am sorry but everyone here is brainwashed ? yes , they mostly are . maybe 4 or 5 of them even tried to read the article . they are just here to signal their observance of media narratives ."
8915,i bet half are bots and the other half are morons that repeat trump bad on every political post on this fucking website .
8916,trump was the one that reversed the obama administration policy of not sending lethal weapons to ukraine .... he's the one that sent them the javelin missiles and the requisite training in the first place .
8917,"maybe , but its still that fucking fascist shooting his mouth off and not understand a single damn thing about the way that the usa's military industrial complex is designed around . the whole reason why we spend absurd amounts on the military and act like the world police so much is because of the massive benefits it brings us . bases everywhere overseas , massive bargaining power with any nation that wants any money from us , the ability to keep any conflicts with any global rivals , or prospective rivals , as far away from the mainland usa as possible ... the usa is the rich asshole in town , the one that everyone wants to be "" friends "" with , and is happy to use their money to make that happen ... because that's how you make even more money , become completely untouchable for any misdeeds , and able to dictate policy on just about anything . it's awful most of the time , but when someone new asshole strolls into down and stats making trouble , they can be useful to have around ..."
8918,it is unfortunate that the eu doesn't have a lot of weapons floating around . denmark tried sending mowag aifv's but they were blocked because they are freaking swiss . of cause most of our equipment is swiss . don't buy swiss military equipment !
8919,"germany has been the biggest let down . most others have stepped up fully , france i believe could do more and spain , im not sure what they have done so far . the rest are handing over equipment asap ."
8920,"i hate trump a lot , but unlike his followers i do believe in facts . hate to say it but hes right . that said this doesnt mean we should be giving less aid because others arent stepping up ."
8921,trump went after germany bc he hated merkel and she had his number as a fool . he was intimidated by her . he offered zero solutions for germany . just his usual lobbing bombs with no facts or ideas to change .
8922,"god , people here are so fucking stupid ."
8923,it is misleading . link to the article via google translate : [ i doubt more than 1 % of the people on this thread even clicked the link to try to read the article .
8924,so the title is a click bait ugh ? looks like the comments didn't even bother reading
8925,"sadly , 90 % of the people here are brainwashed by media narratives , and they just read a headline , and then rant . they never read the article , and they have zero intention of doing so ; the headline is enough to trigger their response . basically , npcs . i am not american , i am from europe , and i am sick to death reading constant misinformation from the american left wing everywhere . it's as bad as the russian propaganda ."
8926,he also had several private meetings with putin . was that to fuck him too ?
8927,"the us economy is not in a recession though , by a decent margin . it's currently forecasted to grow by 2.4 % this year ."
8928,and people are so obsessed with hating trump that they won't read the article ( which is in russian lol ) and just upvote each other's circle jerk .
8929,"the question becomes if that's a real complaint , or if trump's complaint is itself misinformation . germany , for instance , has already announced it will increase military spending above 2 % of gdp permanently , and triple defense spending this year to $ 160 billion , nearly as much in gdp terms as what the us will spend this year . germany is making big orders for all kinds of weapons systems , and it's only been five months . when you look at aid to ukraine , the us has provided the most support , but when you add up eu institutions and individual member states , it's not that large of a difference ( about ~ 30 billion vs ~ 40 billion )"
8930,"he said that european countries should be pulling their weight more with helping ukraine , you just didnt read the article"
8931,"im not here to start an argument , but why did you think that ? like what about biden is worse than literally anything about trump ps i didnt downvote you and dont support people doing it , you learned from your mistakes and should be proud of that"
8932,"trump delayed the delivery of stingers in the past and wanted ukraine to pay for them , only decided to do it when his aides convinced him that it would be good for business . then he tried to get zelensky to say that it was ukraine who interfered in the 2016 , not russia . he can't be trusted ."
8933,"he is not fine with ukraine , and has shown this many , many times ."
8934,i dont think anyone wants nato to pay in shit .
8935,"... did you actually read the article and watch the embedded video of his speech , or just rage at the headline ? because the headline is misinformation as fuck ."
8936,putin is still banking on 2024 . he will help install trump .
8937,"he was relying on it also breaking up nato , which it might had done if trump were in power"
8938,and probably sold alaska to them once they asked
8939,"a reminder to everyone trump withheld javelins from zelensky ( yes , the same zelensky ) for political dirt on biden ."
8940,trump sure looks like a russian asset .
8941,an abrams for a night in his hotel . a f-35 for a mar-a-lago yearly membership .
8942,literally
8943,he still would have invaded ... and trump would have cut a horrible deal that essentially gave up ukrainian sovereignty .
8944,"it would have , given the western response to zapad 2019 and the subsequent buildup that was an exercise ( more a dry run for the feb invasion )."
8945,most of the commonly understood reasons for the invasion would still be in play if trump was the president : 1 ) putin wants to recreate the russian empire . 2 ) oil and gas in donbas and the ukrainian parts of the black sea . the russians want those because it'll remove a potential competitor and give them a bigger supply . 3 ) putin's wounded ego from the ukrainians rejecting his puppet rulers . putin would likely have still invaded ukraine .
8946,nato expansion isn't a threat and never was . in reality putin couldn't care less about who is in nato .
8947,trump had to be cajoled in to doing so . and was impeached for withholding aid for personal reasons .
8948,"the first invasion ? you mean in 2014 when russia took crimea ? obama was president at the time , not trump ."
8949,"trump's ' business ' is to launder money . he's never in his wildest dreams created a successful business entity . in fact , the most success he's ever enjoyed was landing the role on tv and that was not his idea ."
8950,"plus it's almost certain that if putin goes down , he'll take trump with him . there's a good chance that the invasion of ukraine was discussed during the talk between him and putin ( when he even dismissed his translator , so only he , putin and the russian translator were in the room !). putin 100 % got a lot of dirt on him that would end him , so he plays along . apart from the fact that trump is full on mentally ill and a megalomaniac ."
8951,this is how you pin the tail on the donkey kids well done . russian criminal oligarchs like to do this to wash money . because you can use cash to purchase everything you need to build houses . what a crooked cunt that trump is
8952,the might also have a tape of trump getting pissed on by russian hookers .
8953,"it is much more direct than that . trump has been in the thrall of russia since 1987 . he literally went to moscow bankrupt and came back campaigning for nato to be disbanded , all the way back in 1987 . they've funded his "" businesses "" for decades . this is just the price of being a russian asset ."
8954,"that's pure speculation , and sounds like some lazy corporate journalism . the real answer is closer to : trump is trying to push the idea that corrupt washington is prioritizing ukraine over the well being of the american people . that's a narrative that has been promoted on the right , and trump is correctly identifying that as something that can help him ."
8955,"this , and probably some kompromat ."
8956,trump put a full page anti nato ad in the new york times in the 80's . he has been laundering money for the russian mob for decades .
8957,"> from a ukrainian perspective , he belongs in prison for what he did to us from an american perspective , he belongs in prison for what he did to the us"
8958,far right hates communists though . or they did until trump told them something different ?
8959,"lets not forget trump jr , jarivanka , and manafucked all met with a known russian agent to discuss dirt on hillary clinton in exchange for doing away with sanctions in the magnitsky act . trump jr even admitted to it and said hed do it again . yet is somehow still free ."
8960,"well said . there are things you can read about and think you understand , but seeing and experiencing them for yourself ... it's uh , different . really scary a lot of times ."
8961,"trump jr admitted to meeting russian agents , along with jared and manafort being there , for the purpose of getting dirt on hillary clinton and in exchange they would remove sanctions in the magnitsky act . theres no need for conspiracy theories . whole family is bought by putin ."
8962,he doesnt have to be in contact with the russians to be an asset for them . they just recognise that he does things and think things that line up with their interests or can be easily manipulated to do so .
8963,"no chance of that at all . he knows he is a weak-minded fool-he doesn't understand how or why , but he knows he is ."
8964,"and the weak absolutely have the right to gang up together and push back against the strong , and prove that they're not actually as strong as everyone thought they were ."
8965,fun fact : elon endorsed kanye .
8966,"at least elon musk's companies are doing good things for science , engineering and the planet , even if you conclude that it's for selfish reasons . trump is probably more responsible than anyone else for breaking politics in the usa and brainwashing so many republicans . he's done no good in his whole life as far as i can tell . ( that's not to say all republicans are idiots though or that dems don't have their own brainwashed faction either )."
8967,he also exhibits every single trait of the [ dark triad .](
8968,i agree everything up to and including january 6th was literally a crime and treason ( imo ). but denying the entire world speaks of insanity . he can't believe what he's pushing .
8969,"i believe there was a general on board an airplane whose son had lost his life . as they were flying over some military graveyard , trump called them "" suckers and losers ."" i don't remember which general it was , though ."
8970,gutted ? it will be taken over by trump loyalists . as will every government agency . they're already planning on a massive government take over in 2025 . this is basically a planned fascist take over of the united states :
8971,> the russian wing of the republican part once upon a time this was a plot line in fiction movies . now it's reality . shudder .
8972,trump was already attacking nato during his presidency ....
8973,pretty sure its self explanatory the official us military was meant by figuzmak .
8974,they don't want to make him a martyr . a large part of the country is under the trump spell .
8975,having him go to trial and get off would be worse . doj is working their way up the food chain . as david french points out at the atlantic trump still has a potential defense against incitement beyond a reasonable doubt ( though at this point the evidence presented against him is probably enough to justify a civil verdict ). the ga case is actually a lot stronger since the underlying offense doesn't raise the same first amendment issues .
8976,"the golden shower tapes come to mind also , putin as an ex-kgb has access to a lot of dirt on trump ..."
8977,"ill preface this by saying that i utterly despise trump and he is one of the worst things to happen to humanity in decades . that said , he cant be considered a utter failure because he has normalised the use of fake news in mainstream media around the world . either intentionally or not , this has been extremely successful in destroying democracy in several countries , most notably america , australia the uk and many , many others . he has set the precedent that authorities dont have to tell the truth to the public anymore , no matter how insane , because people dont like to be wrong . they support politicians like they would a sport team , and trump added air to the fire by radicalising his cult following . so yes , the man is a sack of walking shit that the world wouldve been better off without . but he has succeeded in undermining the integrity of global news and media around the world ."
8978,"wrong , its past that .... now they can pay him and he will say it to his fanatical base and no one will suspect it , because they could not catch him for it the 1st time , so no one will try the 2nd time . the envelope is being passed , russia needs trump ."
8979,you'd think but his poll number are a lot stronger than they ought to be . there are a lot of dumb people in this country .
8980,that's what i thought the first time he ran . i was wrong .
8981,"or there'd be an old-school republican , who remembers the red scare and won't lose a chance to act out and put this nightmare to the rest via active support of victims ."
8982,"there are some very pro-ukraine republicans like liz cheney . the republican establishment supports ukraine ( mcconnel , chris christie , pence , nikki haley ). even some trump shills like elise stefanik support ukraine ( although she's clearly an educated moderate republican who just jumped on the trump train in a desperate attempt to gain more power )."
8983,they still have to rebuild ukraine . trump pulled a ton of money out of foreign aid to poor countries so there is still that .
8984,the ultra right is bad news for ukraine and europe as a whole . desantis is a strong contender and shares the same view . the only way they'll change their view is if their base changes which isn't likely .
8985,"yeah , but he's explicitly calling for abandoning ukraine . you would have at least expected some sort of ambiguity from him . this means that the u.s . will let russia annex ukraine ( and probably eastern/central europe on top of that ) if he becomes president . trump will absolutely pull out of nato if he's elected again . if the u.s . leaves nato , nato will disintegrate in five minutes . the u.s . is the lynchpin of nato . i cannot even imagine how catastrophic another trump term will be for europe . his second term will probably nullify any us influence in europe since his isolationist rhetoric keeps ramping up . you will also see le pen and other far-right extremists in power . eastern/central european countries will be completely abandoned . the eu will probably disintegrate as well ."
8986,there are still a lot of primaries coming up for the house and senate and also republicans might feel like they have to take on trumps stance . so it might have a big effect on the amount of us support ukraine gets in the future either with military aid or with the help rebuilding .
8987,"here's a link to the same page with google translate : [ but , don't just read the page , actually look at what trump said . most of the time people just misquote him and put a click-bait article . trump sent javelins to ukraine - twice - and was criticised by biden and the democrats for doing so ; they claimed he was provoking putin and risking war with russia . dig a bit deeper than the media narrative , and look at what actually happened ."
8988,"> it's pretty close ( eu ~ 30 billion , us about ~ 40 billion ). i doubt that figure for eu support - can you source it ? france , germany and poland , by far the largest eu donors , have only donated a combined c7 billion euros in both military and economic aid . to put that in perspective , the uk , which is not part of the eu , has committed some 6.217 billion euros on its own . i am taking figures from kiel universities ukraine support tracker , and i see no conflicting figures from the eu . this shows the eu at around 11.3 billion euros , vs us at 32.6 billion euros ."
8989,i mean him getting golden showers from prostitutes is the pee pee tapes i am looking for dirty don and his little tiny micro penis
8990,people are idiots .
8991,"those three you name ( germany , france , spain ) are three of the largest economies in eu and make up a majority of the gdp , i believe . some of the rest like estonia and poland are doing great , but the unfortunate that they are small economies and their impact is limited if the biggest eu economies are being useless ."
8992,"so ' stop buying russian gas , start spending on military ' was just a sick burn on merkel ... who is super smart and intimidating . yet here we are with germany acting like pussies - terrified of being cut off from russian gas . makes perfect sense ."
8993,trump went after merkel because she was an appeaser that wanted to build nordstream2 that would have increased german dependence on russian gas from a horrible ~ 50 % level to a mind-numbingly atrocious ~ 70 % level . he was fed up with that bs and sanctioned nordstream2 .
8994,"yeah he still said some laughable shit in the article about how russia wouldnt have invaded if he was president lol but the us does foot the bill for most of this war so european countries should match the amount the us donated as a proportion of its gdp , currently only a few small countries do"
8995,well said . what's worse is that these people vote .
8996,world leader have private meetings all the time . and they couldnt have been that private if everyone knows about it
8997,"meanwhile inflation is at 9 % and the costs of basic goods and services are going through the roof . we are in for a bad time economically , but to be clear that does not mean that i want any aid to ukraine reduced . keep sending it and then some ."
8998,"$ 40 billion is an old number , us direct support to ukraine has already surprised $ 66bn"
8999,supporting peoples rights to freedom in their own country = evil to republicans .

9017,nato countries are more than happy to ignore russia and focus on making money . russia doesnt want to be ignored . it wants to be feared .
9018,putin totally cares about nato . he knows that russia doesnt even have a speck of a chance if nato gets involved .
9019,you're responding to a comment which says putin wasn't worried because trump wouldn't expand nato with a comment that says nato expansion was never a threat . do you not see the irony ? was nato expansion really not a threat or was stopping nato expansion by trump beneficial to putin ?
9020,didn't he bankrupt a casino ?
9021,"if he had simply taken daddy's money and put it in a simple savings account , he would have vastly more money now . my favorite is when trump opened trump plaza in atlantic city . even after stiffing 90 % of the contractors , he still couldn't make any money . on opening day , he could claim a profit . only because daddy purchased 5 million in chips then left the casino with them . pathetic ."

9027,and a malignant narcissist .
9028,there's an interesting article on the topic from a few years back
9029,that's just locker room talk
9030,talk about your pure speculation ! trump is a known fraud and scammer . he and the post-plastic kids bragged about how they had such great connections with the russian elite that the fact american banks told them to f themselves didnt hurt their business . the right promotes any narrative that the aggressively gullible will believe to keep them voting against their own self interests .
9031,"yes , he is identifying something that could help him . i would be more interested in a president who was interested in helping our country . wft is wrong with you that his actions don't enrage you ?"
9032,any archived versions of it ? would be interesting to see .
9033,"he used our money to extort an american ally at war , to benefit himself personally . he should be shot for treason ."
9034,communism ended in russia when the ussr fell . what came afterwards is a corrupt fascist petrostate run by organized crime where only putin's pals profited . and they profited handsomely .
9035,the new far right/maga meta is supporting russia because ( in their eyes ) russia doesnt put up with us/nato globo-homo lgbt femboys and is instead a chad authoritarian proto-white ethnostate .
9036,"there are no communists in russia anymore since the nineties . that country is a capitalist kleptocracy already for decades . for communism you have to go to china , north korea , cuba .."
9037,"nah , the far-right has flipped , they love russia because of their traditional values and anti-nato , anti-globalist anti-lgbt , anti-jewish , pro-nationalism and pro christianity views . russia hasnt been communist for a very , very long time ."
9038,"none of them have ever known what that word means . they just hate it . here's a bit of a write-up . not for justification of anything , just some historical context . russia's never been communist . lenin tried to make them communist , but he was too prideful and incompetent . lenin became a monster and just paved the way for stalin's regime . stalin then turned the ussr away from lenin's communist regime towards a state-capitalist regime . because he wanted all the money and power . stalin then gaslighted the world the same way putin is trying to now . stalin projected his capitalist crimes on the west while claiming to be the opposite . just as putin projects his wagner neo-nazis , lying , warcrimes , and losses on ukraine while claiming its a "" special military operation "" that is the paragon of humanitarian aid with only 1500 losses . nah , the communists actually fucking hate stalinists and russia both . george orwell ( yes , the george orwell of animal farm and 1984 ) was an anarcho-communist who fought in the spanish civil war on the side of the soum , an anarcho-communist group . in the 1930s . then the soviet nkvd purged the soum . animal farm itself was based off his other work homage to catalonia . homage to catalonia was a memoir of orwell's experience in communist/socialist communities , a love letter to thise communities , and a scathing hate letter to the nkvd . or nestor ivanovich makhno , an anarcho-communist who was once a majorly influential political figure in ukraine . his movement in the 1900s and 1910s once occupied a large area of ukrainian territory . makhno was one of the small number of men to make anarcho-communism actually functional for an extended period of time . communities under his influence even had small capitalist sectors and the two groups were actually co-existing , doing business , and not constantly out for blood . makhno's black army took part in army russian civil war against lenin's red army and the tentpole white army . lenin stabbed makhno in the back , purged his movement , and comitted warcrimes against ukrainians to spite makhno . remnants of makhno's movement or at least a vengeful grudge on his part still exist today . such as inthee form of the coac . the combat organization of anarcho-communists . the coac is the group claiming responsibility for most of the partisan sabotage and activity in russian territory . getting revenge for makhno , aiding his homeland keep independence , and spiting russia all at once . anarcho-communists have been waiting for this chance to fight russia longer than americans have . they fucking hate the russians ."
9039,"the far right makes no sense on many fronts . like , they proclaim to be christian while willfully going against the core principles of christianity . on that point they are deeply afraid about sharia law in muslim countries and communities while trying to implement sudo-sharia law in the us . just with the few christian teachings they agree with . they always proclaim to be the scientifically minded when it comes to discrediting constructs like optional gender and whatnot . but at the same time they proudly spit in the face of science when it comes to climate , pandemic restrictions vaccines and probably many more topics ."
9040,"that is a key part of the tale that perplexes me the most in that everyone just shrugs about that . they literally set up a meeting with an fsb agent . yeah , so ? is the reaction from their supporters ."
9041,"additionally , a cursory google search on the number of russian nationals who have purchased properties in trump-owned or licensed buildings over the last 3 decades would lead the average person to wonder if its something more than just coincidental that wealthy russians buy condos in trump-related ( owned or licensed ) properties . mind you , these tend to be more affluent russians so one can deduce ( or come up with excuses for ) where these wealthy russians got their expendable money to buy american real estate and why they are buying american real estate . further , both eric and traitor tot don jr . are on record ( video , i believe ) stating they sell ( well , before the 2016 election ) an inordinate percentage of their properties to russians . just coincidence ? but the whole russia angle is a hoax . just ask them . the entire fucking family seems unable to remember ( or unwilling to ) what they have publicly said yesterday and you just should just go with what they say today which is they are the most patriotic and wholesome bunch of americans that america will ever know . they can all - all - get fucked . melanie , too . donald j trump is a cancer to the world and , especially , the united states . and anyone who stands idly by him can meet the same fate as him ."
9042,elon is in a zone of his own .
9043,"at least elon essentially told rashists to go chase the cruiser moskva , and gave ukraine starlink ."
9044,i agree with you about musk . trump has been an absolute scourge .
9045,it was general kelly and they were at the graveside of his son i believe .
9046,because letting it go unchallenged instead has been working out so well
9047,id say were liberated from the spell with a lack of empathy for ukraine . hes losing our crowd big time .
9048,its more like setting a precedent that presidents aren't untouchable is something niether established democrats or republicans want to see happen for their own personal interests
9049,"i voted for trump the first time .. big mistake ! i'll never vote republican again[to be exact im not a democrat but somewhere in the middle , like most ppl i think ] .. but i really disliked hilary then . i'll be the first to say i made a mistake , but omg the brainwashed idiots that still follow trump have to be less then 50 % of what they once were .. it's only the extreme right that still worship him .. imo it's like a less extreme form of putinusm"
9050,"yeah , and as a result , he has a chance to become the president again ."
9051,"its more of a vocal and angry minority that , thanks to our system of government and representation that absolutely represents a threat to not only the usa but the world . they have ( the red states ) an outsized representation ."
9052,"plus , if he actually gets convicted for his crimes in georgia , the governor doesnt have pardon power in georgia ."
9053,"agreed . but as a russian asset , he failed at his primary objectives . he couldn't soften america's reaction to russian bullshit , nor break nato , nor abandon ukraine . this is a sub about ukraine . there are a lot of other subs about trump's awful effects . i'm attempting a narrow focus here ."
9054,"liz cheney's career as a republican politician is over . she will never win re-election , because she's on the jan 6 panel investigating the trump administration ( and it's one of the most vocal members of that panel ). because of this she's been removed from every party position they could remove her from and she's been completely sidelined . republicans will not tolerate criticism of trump ."
9055,"as fucking cheesy as it sounds we're literally living in some good vs evil fucking story . i want out of this timeline into a boring , normal one ."
9056,"> if the u.s . leaves nato , nato will disintegrate in five minutes . the u.s . is the lynchpin of nato . i agree complete that the us is the linchpin of nato , and without the us even basic functions of nato might break down ( for example , sweden and finland will only be actual members after their ratification documents are * deposited with the us government *), but there would still be two nuclear powers in the remaining countries and several reasonably powerful militaries . i don't think it would disintegrate in five minutes , the alliance would still have power ."
9057,"i think that's a great source , and if you scroll down , it [ breaks down support into eu institutions + member states vs us ]("
9058,"i dont agree with a lot of what trump says , but i do agree that all nato members should commit and spend 2 % of gdp , and all should help equally in relative terms compared to that spend . the us will always end up spending more because their military budget it enormous , but the rest should be matching or exceeding ( like the smaller states are ) in relative terms ."
9059,"plenty of people hate trump and i can understand that , but the guy was absolutely correct about the strategic situation in europe and tried to make nato stronger , and if merkel had listened then maybe we wouldnt be here right now , but people will not let their hatred of the man go long enough to see that it was truth , and will make any argument to discount it ."
9060,"well to be fair ... russia invaded crimea , donetsk and luhansk , when obama was president , and biden vp . they did not send military aid to ukraine . trump bombed russian troops in syria , twice . trump sent military aid to ukraine . russia did not invade ukraine when trump was president . russia did invade ukraine now biden is president . so , trump has a point ..."
9061,"the us has appropriated more , but has yet to provide it . support by country [ is up-to-date as of july 1 and tracked here ]("
9062,with any luck both will be dead by then . fuck em !
9063,he makes fun of the fact biden fell off a bike .. because biden does this thing called exercise .. if trump actually tried to propel a bike it'd be game over
9064,"lacking empathy . they don't stress about other people , so they live longer ."
9065,"with the amount of mcdonalds , soda , and amphetamines trump consumes , tbh i'm actually impressed he's still alive ."
9066,"and yet , in areas of eastern usa that traditionally vote republican , i occasionally see ukranian flags flying and church billboards that say , "" pray for ukraine "". republicans need to pay more attention to their own voters and less attention to trump ."
9067,""" we bought alaska for $ 7.2 million and sold it back for $ 50 million . that's almost 10 times the profit , no one else could have gotten a better deal for alaska than me ."""
9068,""" it's almost as good a deal as the deal to buy greenland . i'm looking at you , sweden . you had your chance to sell us greenland , but the woke globalists in the swedish capital of helsinki denied our deal . said it was a rotten deal - it wasn't a rotten deal , not at all a rotten deal ."""

9071,there would be no need to care about the 3 electoral votes alaska gives him if in exchange russia rigs all future elections in his favor
9072,"of course not . putin told jim it wasn't , and anything out of putins mouth is like a big mac to trump , including cancerous ulcer pus . he just gobbles that shit right up . nomnomnom ."
9073,has he actually said this publically
9074,"proving that it is , in fact , possible to bankrupt a licensed casino in atlantic city - ** 3 times **."
9075,which is absolutely astonishing . the one business that's as close to a license to print money...and he can't get ink for the printers .
9076,three of them actually .
9077,"2 of them . i know , i'm pretty sure even i couldn't bankrupt a casino . someone should give me one as an experiment ."
9078,and blamed it on his business partners after they died in a crash . and didn't pay contractors . and didn't lose the election . and only loses at smash cuz the joystick is drifting .
9079,"not to be pedantic . but an index fund , not a savings account . savings accounts havent historically beaten inflation and are not investment instruments . tiny detail aside your premise is absolutely correct , this jackstick is not a business person . hes an agent of chaos for chaoss sake . its the whole theory of the small-enough-to-drown-in-a-bathtub government : making government stop functioning so they can auction off its functions to their cronies ."
9080,"he could have sold a maga mask , made a quadrillion bucks , help bring about an end to the pandemic and probably get re elected ... thank god he's dumber than a sack of hammers ."
9081,made in china ofcourse .
9082,malignant narcissistic sociopath .
9083,i didn't say i believe it .
9084,"he also shattered a 236 year tradition of peaceful transfer of power in our country . he and his allies should be hung , drawn , and quartered ."
9085,that .. sounds exactly like the ussr
9086,they see putin as the defender of white christianity
9087,i think there are significant personality related similarities between both the far right and far left .
9088,"it's fun , when some nutsack spouts off about socialism or communism , at a party , to ask them for a succinct definition of either . "
9089,"that's semantics and "" not real communism "", which is honestly tiresome . mao's china , soviet union , kampuchia etc were all led by communist parties . we know by now what happens when they take power and i don't want a repeat anywhere near my country , thanks . we had war communism , red terror ( spearheaded by trotsky ) and then holomodor in the name of "" building communism "". the latter one so the soviet union could sell grain and buy american machinery and engineers . and lenin ultimately allowed market economy and private initiative because the whole thing was being a failure . stalin decided he can solve the problem with slave labour instead . makhno fell in with bolsheviks after petty disagreements with unr and then got promptly betrayed once they won ."
9090,and then they say russia russia russia hoax !
9091,"elon's elon . but , given that his company spacex was able to wean world off russian commercial launches ( while kicking the commercial launch programs into overdrive , which is also good - more competition means healthier market ) and brought independent crew launch capability , it's a net gain for the humanity and a gigantic pain in the ass for russia ."
9092,"starlink and gis aa , name a more iconic duo"
9093,* this is what creates the likes of putin *
9094,fascism sucks like that .
9095,"why ? his base didn't care the last time he fucked with ukraine , infact they chose to cover for him . thinking that trumps supporters will be broken out of their spell will happen , but no where near enough ."
9096,"on national public radio , the commentators were quick to hammer in the point that january 6th was nothing less than a failed coup , that if we did not take decisive measures now , that the us risks the possibility of a successful one in the future . if we learned nothing from the collapse of the weimar republic in germany in the 1930s , we risk the chance of repeating the mistake - here , in the united states , but with consequences that may even be more dire than what the nazis wrought in europe . ukraine represents an opportunity to emphasize the strengths of good governance writ on the world stage , a march to the more center-aligned politics which have governed the us for nearly a century . admittedly it has not always worked well ( see hungary in the 1950s and the prague spring , as well as vietnam , cuba and central america ). if djt does not go to jail there are other bad actors who have no interest in small d democracy waiting in the wings to push our country ( and the world with it ) off the cliff of representative government that respects human and civil rights . this is what putin is salivating for , and the closer we bond with ukraine , the greater our strength , together ."
9097,"it's hard to write laws that prevent the president of the united states doing things . if you start to call decisions by a president criminal , then every president starts getting indicted by the next administration of the opposite party , forever ."
9098,i voted for trump because i am so fucking sick of the same people and families in office all the time . still feel that way but definately going to not vote for crazy anymore .
9099,"glad you saw the light . there was a lot of propaganda before , during , and after the 2016 election . all we can do is learn from our mistakes ."
9100,i didnt like hillary because shed be the same third way centrist her husband was and biden is . but is still voted for her over a russian clown .
9101,really ? i didnt know that about georgia .
9102,the future of the us-led neoliberal world order might depend on the murdoch family or a few thousand swing voters in georgia .
9103,"i feel with you , tovarisch , i feel with you ."
9104,"britain would probably be able to hold the alliance for a bit longer , but there's strong anti-nato sentiment in france coming from malenchon and le pen supporters ( the far-left and the far-right ). don't count on france to save nato . they will probably be the next country to leave ."
9105,"yep ,,, and as mentioned , the breakdown is apparently : > eu at around 11.3 billion euros , vs us at 32.6 billion euros . as a european taxpayer , i do think europe should be doing more . if one adds up the energy receipts paid to russia by the eu , you could argue that they have donated more to russia than to ukraine , since the invasion began . these are the points trump is making , not that support for ukraine should be withdrawn ."
9106,that link still shows the us providing significantly more than the entire eu as a whole . and also seeing as it doesnt include deliveries like the himars which weve already seen videos of it just goes to show how out of date that is .
9107,get these fossils out of politics
9108,if biden was on a normal bike he would have been fine . his pedals have toe-cages and he didn't clear them - happens to most everyone using them at some point . in the other corner ... trump had to ride in a golf cart instead of walk with other world leaders ... and that was 4 + years ago
9109,i would actually pay to see trump ride a bike 
9110,"red as fuck ohio here , i've seen multiple ukrainian flags in random places . like , rundown house on 10 miles of county road with 5 broken vehicles in the yard ? blue and yellow hanging right next to the stars and stripes . saw one hanging from a catholic church in one of our bigger cities . conservatives seem split on if they like russia because trump likes putin , or they hate russia because communism ."
9111,why would they bother ? their voters will still vote for them .
9112,he was so stupid asking to buy greenland when he should have known that denmark owns it .
9113,""" sweden , denmark...what's the difference ? it's one of those scandimanavian countries , that i know . good fish , they love their fish those people ... ever had fish tacos ? they sell them in restaurant in trump plaza , never had them , people seem to like them , they sure sell a lot of them ."""
9114,greenland is danmark ...
9115,try denmark

9117,not to mention trump airlines .
9118,"if he ever got his hands on a machine that could print $ 100 bills , he would demand to have his face on the bills . making them worthless ."
9119,that sounds very russian .
9120,hahahaha . imagine that . hahahaha . macovidfreea . hahaha
9121,"by his daughter , meaning her friendly child labourers ..."
9122,you called it a fact .
9123,""" let's help our farmers , our sick , our unemployed instead""what a lying , despicable sack of shit.i hope somebody does the right thing to prevent him or any of his family to get back into a place of too much power ."
9124,"not so sure the tradition is that long , given what happened when lincoln was elected ."
9125,and bringer of the apocalypse ....
9126,"putin is not a defender of christianity , are russians even white or part asian anyway ? patton called them "" asiatic ."" most trump supporters are struggling working class people who voted for him primarily for economic reasons , unfortunately a portion will blindly follow him or people like tucker carlson who stand against ukraine ."
9127,"oh absolutely , the far left still believe russia is the soviet union and furiously defend their motherland ( it died ). russia is a political nightmare , the duma is full of far-right nationalists , putins party is basically support putin or goto prison and the left are virtually non-existent in russia today . what i think is funny is the western far-right love russia , the russians hate them ."
9128,"north korea goes by the name "" democratic people's republic of korea "". does that mean that it is reasonable to use north korea's evils to prove that democracies/republics are bad ?"
9129,"i'm going to preface what i'm about to say with reiterating that stalin and lenin were fucking monsters . so were mao and castro . i literally called lenin a monster right after acknowledging that he was trying to install communism . lenin was socialist . lenin was communist . he was still a genocidal war criminal and i hope he burns in hell . there was literally no attempt at "" semantics "" of any word i used anywhere in what i said . you're just using a canned argument straight out of mccarthyism propaganda . ya know , the exact propaganda the far-right americans cling to to keep influence and has gotten them so far that they felt confident enough to attempt a violent coup . with a man guilty of the same incompetence and messiah complex lenin had at their helm . the man the headline in the op talks about . the concept behind red scare had reason to fear the ussr , but it was just used as another propaganda tool . an attempt by wannabe-oligarchs in american to make americans run so far to the right in fear of the "" left "" of "" communist/socialist "" china/russia that politicians here could begin stripping all socialist policies that kept america's government in check . and eventually strip any options for peaceful democracy . all for the sake of turning america into its own kleptocratic state-capitalist regime exactly like russia with themselves at the helm . why the do you think russia's so buddy-buddy with with the people trying to do this . the same people who were screeching for russian blood just 20 years ago ? it's because they're the same state-capitalist ideology . again , as i said at the start of this post and at the start of my last post , i am not attempting to justify anything stalinists or maoists did . i myself fucking hate both of them . i literally said at the start of this that lenin was indeed trying to install communism ( unlike the state-capitalism of stalin ) and he was a fucking monster , too . you can send me all the canned responses you want . just like the first one , you won't be responding to , let alone refuting , anything i actually said . for an actual response to the non-canned things you said : yes , makhno entered a temporary alliance with the bolsheviks to defeat the white army . remember that it was a war of multiple parties ? it's like america and britain teaming up with the ussr to fight germany . that doesn't mean america and britain were stalinist . war is complicated and sometimes you have to make less-than-optimal choices . just like how churchill warned of stalin and the ussr , makhno still considered lenin and the bolsheviks his enemy . lenin just got the jump on them first . the holodomor was one of the greatest genocides of humanity , but don't act like lenin , ( the only actual leftist between stalin and lenin ) had anything to do with it . lenin was exiled years before the holodomor took place . instead , you should point to the great famine that lenin caused in the late 1810s and early 1820s . a decade before the holodomor ."
9130,"and starlink , which has been a huge part of ukrainian success ."
9131,because last time the world hardly knew what was going on . now we can clearly see how badly they fucking needed that military aid .
9132,his base is not enough to win a national election even with the electoral college . there are a lot of people you and i would consider normal who voted for trump . losing their support hurts his chances of winning again .

9134,"no they won't . french distrust nato because they distrust us . once the us gone , they'll have no problem with it ."
9135,"when you add up all the eu institutions and member states and compare that to the us , you end up with : * 27.2 billion usd eu contributions * 42.9 billion usd us contributions notably , that does not include contributions from the uk , which is no longer part of the eu . the eu and us contributions both work out to the same 0.18 % of gdp of the eurozone and us . and that link doesn't include any weapons systems , because it's tracking the total value of contributions , not the particular system , so not sure what your point is about himars . the us contributions in june which included himars are included . any additional transfers since july 1 are not . none of this is meant to claim the us has not contributed a ton . it has . but in gdp terms , it's exactly the same , and thus trump's entire premise is fake ."

9161,a la stephen elop as a head of nokia ?
9162,"the point is that breaking up the union is not really peacefully transferring power . it's actively rejecting the administration of power by that president . a peaceful transfer of power would involve lincoln being recognized as president by all the states ( and , furthermore , not having to sneak into washington under cover of darkness because baltimore could be dangerous to him ). not several states rejecting the election outcome entirely . also , lincoln had not actually made any commitments to change slavery in any way in the slave states . it's just that the slave states had become so extreme in their defense of slavery that they could not accept anything less than full support for slavery in all forms ."
9163,"the us is not spending twice as much as the eu . it's spending about 40 % more . because the us economy is about 40 % larger than the entire eu . and when you include the uk in the eu total , the us and eu contributions are nearly the same in absolute terms . you can frame it as the us bailing out the eu as much as you want , but the contributions are the exact same share of gdp . separately , there is a massive refugee crisis , and the eu is dealing with housing and supporting five million refugees all at once ."

9176,yeah . wasn't their real beef that lincoln and the republicans wouldn't allow any more new states to be slave states ? sorry if i'm misinformed - apus history was a long time ago when southern historians still dominated .
9177,"youre missing the point , trump and many others are questioning why the us is constantly footing the bill for issues in europe . we just ended a way after 20 years because people were unwilling to foot the bill and now all of the sudden were paying significantly more for someone elses war in europe than we were spending for our own war . thats what the point of this article is about . its a pretty simple concept : why is the us paying for europe ? its not about matching gdp or any of that , its the simple question of why are we doing to when they should be doing it themselves ?"
9178,"lol , i had no idea ."
9179,"the us is paying for ukraine to the same extent that europe is , because the us has an interest in promoting and defending democracies . it's not britain's war , or france's war . both of them are nuclear powers with their own deterrence . neither are in an alliance with ukraine . you're insisting on framing this as a european conflict , but it's a conflict between two states . the eastern european states directly impacted by the conflict are spending much , much more than the us in gdp terms ."

9188,how did they even do that so poorly ?
9189,best of ruskie engineering lol 
9190,shit product from a shit society
9191,jesus motorcycling christ ! what the hell is that ????
9192,it seems to be worse than made in china products at least chinese products look the part even if the quality is fishy
9193,you know ... this might explain why the storm troopers from starwars couldn't hit anything : their barrels looked like this !!!
9194,"this shouldn't be all that surprising , they couldn't even keep rain out of their t34's during ww2 . quality hasn't improved since ."
9195,"and that is why all the russian artillery tubes are wearing out and now starting to "" banana "" ["
9196,metric scale i assume . corruption at its finest .
9197,that barrel has made me worry a whole lot less about their nukes
9198,"they said barrel , heres the barrel . didnt precise "
9199,yeah thats what you get when the money for proper equipment and quality assurance is used for new villa and pool of factory director and the rest for bribes for the army guy who does the audit .
9200,you fools this was all part of the master plan . ( checks notes ) everyone knows the left side of the barrel ( looks at notes some more ) is the side that wears out faster . ( shovels 10.7 billion rubles of kremlin money into briefcase ). now excuse me while i attend a wedding in nepal and please tell putin someone else was handling quality control
9201,""" close enough """
9202,"what's the minimum width ? in ww2 , the approach was to minimize any "" unnecessary "" touches and quality control . as long as the barrel meets minimum requirements , it will fire safely , so roll out as many as possible . with that said , to me this shows that the soldiers are viewed as very expendable and not deserving of the best quality ."
9203,you see ivan when barrel is of center enemy cant take cover because no one knows were shell will land . * sips tu-22 coolant *
9204,face like a busted couch . slava ukraini ! don't you let these roaches win . you got this .
9205,"not just good , but good enough "
9206,not a good idea to order @ wish online store
9207,got drunks ? russia certainly does .
9208,"i can see this is obviously bad engineering , but would this cause serious problems in real life ? for example t-34 tanks were badly constructed but were still effective . i understand that weapons are ' boresighted ' before going into combat , so presumably once this process had been done the shells would still go where you wanted them to . the other thing is that it is a bmp weapon which i presume is either 30mm or 76mm and therefore does not need the strength that ( say ) a 120mm + weapon would require . so anyway the question is would the manufacturing defect have an actual impact in combat operation ?"
9209,this presumes theyre supposed to be concentric . great russian engineer maybe did not specify and so why bother says machinist .
9210,wow . such precision
9211,terrible engineering .
9212,"only russia could actually make russia look even more incompetent . russia wins at trolling their own imprecise , 4th world manufacturing ."
9213,this is ... my eye won't stop twitching . gotta love that russkie quality control .
9214,this triggers me so hard right now .
9215,there is nothing wrong with that barrel . it was designed to shoot around corners .
9216,it will heat up at different rates .
9217,this should be spoiler censored so no engineer has to see this by accident
9218,"what do you expect ? when you are a degenerate iwan with an iq so low every other nation would declare you severely disabled,paired with the "" normal "" fas hired to be a gun smith,this is the only possible outcome . tl;dr * made in russia *"
9219,does it pull to one side ? hahaha
9220,this is priceless . russian precision engineering at its fucked up finest . brilliant .
9221,close enough ! a blind man on a galloping horse would never notice the difference . is the cavity straight and of equal diameter for the whole length ? they could always skim the thicker side with an angle grinder .
9222,rifling inside looks fine but than they just said fuck the bore integrity .
9223,"former machinist here .. this made me a little sick . it's not even an equipment issue . drill the bore , then use the bore as a center as you finish the outer diameter to size . could be done on ww2 era equipment easily ."
9224,even the italians are disgusted .
9225,some dude bought a yacht because he made these .
9226,"this is correct , the barrel is optimised for 1.5 permille"
9227,serious . can someone explain this ?
9228,would this actually affect the shot and by how much ? anyone know ?
9229,our barrel 
9230,das ist nicht gut !!!!!!
9231,"i don't want to sound bad here , but that is a 1.5mm excentricity(0.059 inch for my friends with a concusion ). on the other hand , we do not know from which part of the gun this comes . if it comes from the part with the loading mechanism , the 11mm part might be correct and be on the under-side of the gun . i say that because half the world used or still uses that gun , including 1 or 2 nato countries"
9232,"no problem comrades , lets just rebore it to 30mm larger on the correct centre . problem solved . ..... i mean , what could go wrong firing a projectile from barrel not designed for it ? lol . ... i don't know but i'm sure theres a russian out there who's dumb enough to give it a shot ."
9233,is precision 
9234,seems to have been vodka o clock at the barrel factory .
9235,is there any logical reason for the hole to be off centre ? has it been widened or remachined ? or are they literally rifling through reject bins for spares ?
9236,second best military 
9237,pretty obvious the russian military uses wish .
9238,"who cares , as long as you make it now ?"
9239,by posting this you have become their quality control . better to just let it be . now they know what to fix .
9240,so the russian aren't lying regarding targeting civilians . their guns are so misaligned and awfully build that their shots curb so much they miss their targets by miles
9241,he must be siberian . or is it just chinese ?
9242,all the better to fail and cause a major malfunction and destroying the barrel before it can do too much harm .
9243,"listen : we're talking about the nation that accepted tiny , useless nails and giant , useless nails as valid output , so long as they met quota by piece count or tonnage , respectively . is it any kind of surprise that this is the garbage they manufacture ??"
9244,"bmp picture ? no , that's a jpg ."
9245,ruzzian traditional craftsmanship principle
9246,the best that whatever money's left can buy .
9247,just imagine how many people would have had to sign off on a barrel like this to get it installed and deployed . obviously a much bigger problem than one piss poor operator at the lathe .
9248,"as an american this is hilarious , as a machinist i'm concerned"
9249,is it redundant to suggest that whoever did this was probably piss drunk on potato booze ?
9250,"ever watch that movie "" wanted "". this is the first step to "" curving "" your shot ."
9251,you guys are idiots . everyone knows that a 3 cm bore differential is needed to offset the average drunk russian conscript's bac of . 20 affecting his aim . the self correcting bore is better than any gps guided munition manufactured by a western pigsky .
9252,"everyone who lived in the former eastern bloc : yeah ok , what about it ?"
9253,thats so that you know which side will buckle under stress so you stand on the other side and live .
9254,some oligarch stole 3 mm from one side .
9255,peace movement infiltrated the russian tank factory decades ago ?
9256,"i remember how my husband ( japanese ) told me about his fathers trip to russia to outsource wood for their major architectural company . russian company hyped up so much about the quality of syberian pine , but they cut it wrong , out of size and without concern of the strength points . the trip was deemed a waste of time by the delegation . that was around 70 ."
9257,"you know ... for the past few months , i - like everyone else around here - became convinced that these savage invaders were mentally stuck in a 19th century ditch , but i was wrong . they are actually stuck so deep in the goddamned middle ages , they can't even get basic 19th century mass production engineering at a minimally acceptable level ."
9258,"as german motorcycle mechanic who regularly has his hands on russian oldtimers as well , i can confirm that this is the quality standard they have . absolutely terrible ."
9259,"i used to work in a huge industrial workshop , which included several lathes . one of those was operated by a russian ( i live in germany ). when seeing the picture from above , i was reminded of that guy...he actually drank the coolant alcohol , which was being used for cooling down delicate lathe works ... after a while , he got kicked out , because his work...well mostly looked like that . my colleagues had to open his locker later , because he didnt bother clearing it up , when he left . its amazing , how many empty vodka bottles someone can fit into a standard locker . they counted 63 .... no more questions , your honour ...."
9260,"this speaks volumes about russian build quality . simply put , "" f-it "" it looks like the machinist said as he ran the blank on the lathe when they bored the blank out and cut grooves . sucky thing for the crew is that one side of the cannon wall is far thinner . as some of their top tanks get pretty spent after about 1500 rounds , who knows what a bump barrells life is . and that said this barrells life is prolly much less than a perfect barrell . and hopefully they don't get some crappy made rounds that have eyeballed loads that overpressure the bore . because when that happens , that thin side is gonna eventually give out catastrophically and hopefully for whoever is shooting it doesn't shoot that pressure anywhere but out the thin wall . which it should . but hope.they are buttoned up and all that . however given that it's a russian vehicle , fire away . have fun and if it goes boom let's all bopemit goes boom on them . if the ukrainians we're trolling the russians , they'd just park this as is and let the russians "" recapture "" it . maybe after they put a crack in that bore so the next shot is it's last . or just drop a pin on a gps fire solution map , park a loitering drone , and wait for a unsuspecting crew to "" find "" the bmp , hop.in , and then let the drone drop some bombs or hopefully by then the artillery rounds are in the air and on the way to the spot . and merry xmas you z heads . take your shit vehicles back . what's crazy is that over the course of this war we are seeing that very very few of russian made systems are worth a damn . some of their planes , some of their missiles , some subs , and some other stuff here and there but the meat or their armed forces vehicles planes and weapons are just either antiquated , poorly made , badly designed , a few of these , and often a bunch of all of these . as a russian soldier i'd hope to be put on like a boomer sub because their newer and spendy and a major weapons platform . or a very , very new 4th/5th generation jet but there's so few of those it's like winning the lotto for that . and theyre not gonna put you in risky engagements . the only thing the russians have right now really is tons of artillery pieces and 100s of thousands of rounds . daily stats suspect they are shooting upwards of 60,000 rounds of artillery a * day *. and himars is targeting high value targets . meetings , ammo dumps , has , concentrated bivouacs , etc . only time arty pieces will get hit is if they are in high numbers or are really shelling someone from a certain position . i reckon the z heads are trying to trap the himars by putting a bunch of arty in an area and just telling them to shell for hours . hoping that they will get himars to uncover and target that arty . and then have a counter battery hidden all over , several of them , and as soon as himars launch or drones spot em .. if they can , have those areas dialed in or fire counter arty right away . thing is himars can stop and pop and move out before the rockets they launch even hit so to take em out they are going to have the best fire detection suites in the world and who knows if they have anything like that . their best bet is a drone spots em and they get some barrages off before the himars move but even then they might get what , 2 or 3 of them if that ? plus the distance . i just know russia is baiting them and if you're a high value or large target god hell you because you're the lamb being led to the t-rex . and they'll sacrifice you to see the himars launch and then try and hit them . and they might do it but the bait is gonna be just that . bait . and then , dust . but yeah , tl;dr - looks just like what weve come to expect from low speed russian gear . poorly made , poorly used , old , antiquated , and eventually trash and heaps of scrap metal for whoever to collect and salvage and recycle . just go home z-heads . or stay and die ."

9296,makes you wonder how capable their nuclear weapons are . can they actually fire them ? would they stay on target ? would they actually explode ?
9297,nothing but a paper tiger .
9298,i dont think they thought it was a bluff
9299,they've shown their hand . they are essentially a petrol-state but with nukes . they haven't been a major industrial player since the soviet era and likely even then their economy was propped up by selling to communist allies and unwilling warsaw pact countries . they have no economy and have failed to even project power onto a border nation . their only fallback power play is nuclear and that is a scary prospect . hopefully their missile program has been pilfered by corruption like the rest of their military and is functionally neutered .
9300,that sure ain't no lie .
9301,poor quality tools and materials combined with poor workmanship . corruption in the manufacturing process dates pretty far back apparently .
9302,"machines don't run themselves , they require attentive humans and maintenance , both of which russia doesn't gave a stellar record with . in the west these can all be made via a factory type line with very little human intervention amd precision top of the line machinery . i would wager russias manufacturing methods aren't as advanced and have remained exactly the same as it was in the 40s 50s and 60s"
9303,"warning : incoming essay : contrary to what cs majors might tell you , 100 % automated manufacturing is still a pipe dream . people have to load the program to the machine , change out and load tooling , load the blank bar into the machine . even at beretta , the most automated weapons manufacturer still has people doing setups . and thats in a fairly wealthy country like italy . i work in a machine shop in the sillicon valley . and let me tell you , most people in my line of work would slap their cocks on parts for tesla , spacex , generic-nda-military industrial company , and aerospace companies , if they knew they wouldnt get caught . i cant imagine that machinists/operators in russia are going to be any more put together . those guys arent being paid dick and might have gone the way of tesla machine shop employees : drunk or high as fuck while working . the serious answer for the technically inclined : you have a clamp for that bar ; think of the drill bit holder on your cordless nikita drill in your workshop . if you open it all the way , and tighten down as fast as you can , youll prolly get it caught in between the three jaws that clamp down . it will be cockeyed and off center hanging off to the side . now picture that but in the realm of being off center . 001 inches or . 01mm right next to the clamp . looks straight but isnt . we call this runout . as you go farther away ( sources tell me its a 95 inch/2400 mm barrel ) that runout is only going to get worse . if you drill that runout with a gun drill ( a long ass drill with coolant that runs through the middle of the drill attached to something that makes it dead center of that clamp ) it will go straight , but the bar isnt straight , making this behemoth of a part you see before you . depending on the wall thickness needed for this barrel , it could possibly be saved by using inside diameter workholding and gripping onto the inside bore ( which is technically straight ) and turning down the outside of the bar . edit the following has been seemed to have been debonked as another post is saying these are from captured bmps > also i hate to break the circlejerk , fuck the orcs , but this most likely aint a bmp barrel . you can see the guys feet . unless hes 8 feet tall ( in which case rip this guys back in a machine shop all those machines work area is already stupid low to the ground ), this thing aint 95 inches long right ?"
9304,all things possible with wodka

9332,"there's an old russian saying that goes something like "" as long as they pretend to pay us , we'll pretend to work ."""
9333,"these are manufactured in a multi-step process . the barrel is hammer forged to rough dimensions ( including a bore ). then they drill the bore to final dimensions and cut the riffling groves . the bore and riffling is done before the barrel is taken to final outside dimensions to leverage the strength of the extra material and reduce the unfinished barrel breaking from those drilling and cutting operations . once they finish those operations , they run the barrel through the lathe and take it to final exterior dimensions . that final step is really easy to fuck up . the barrel needs to be centered on both ends so you end up with a consistent diameter when you take the exterior to final . if you just check the rough exterior dimension for round in the lathe or only check one end you will end up with a bore that runs diagonally through the barrel , or you might end up with a bore that it out of center . since we only see this one cross cut through the barrel it isnt clear which setup error occurred here ."

9339,"don't need to keep rain out of a tank if it can flow out , but also don't need to keep rain out of a tank if it will be destroyed before a single drop falls . the t-34 was a pretty brilliant machine if you don't count the comfort and lack of protection against gas or molotovs . it was partially superior to the m4 in terms of production . but in general , the t-34 was almost as good as the m4 , especially after the battle of stalingrad , as soviet factories could finally breathe and were able to pump out higher quality t-34's that would last longer than the shoddy earlier ones that were mass produced out of necessity , regardless of quality . but it was still a very capable tank . but the bmp cannon ? that's just embarrassing and the factory that made it should simply shut down , since it does more harm than good to the ruzzian cause . so maybe they should get all the contracts and expand , making sure to retool all ruzzian factories with the same tools they used to make this piece of shite ."

9345,"the first shot ? not at all . but itll get bad , fast , because the increased mass on one side of the barrel will mean the thin side gets hotter , faster . and expands more , which makes the barrel curve toward the thick side . and if the barrel is curved , so is the aim . and itll cause faster wear and possible an explosion in the barrel , inuring or killing the crew ."

9397,"and if the tools aren't bad quality ( like the whole factories that they stole after ww2 ), then they are unmaintained since being acquired ."
9398,"people were manufacturing parts to the ten thousandth of an inch in large volumes in the 1920s and 1930s . gauge blocks were invented in 1896 and should meet tolerances in the hundred-thousandths or millionths of an inch . 1940s manufacturing techniques absolutely had high quality gun barrel machining down pat . these are just wasteoid fuckups who do not give a shit . i'm sure their equipment is shitty and the process is far from efficient , but there is no reason russia today can't make a decent 1940s grade barrel with those processes . it's one thing for a barrel to have been fucked up like this , but for the part to not have been scrapped and actually shipped out is utterly insane ."
9399,"thanks first of all for the quality post . agree this could be noncentric clamping issue . but could also be unskilled tuning , if the work origin is off center ( e.g . drunk or inexperienced operator ) even a perfectly central clamp wouldn't help . also could be that the original part wasn't correctly cylindrical to begin with ( curved / bent ). as to length - pretty sure this is from a wrecked tank , so assume this is a barrel cut in half or even more pieces ."

9432,"the water leakage was a problem because it destroyed the electronics that rotated the turret forcing manual turret rotation . it's actually a really , really big deal to keep water out . gotta protect your electronics in a tank . the t34 armor did not have an interior anti-spalling layer like the m4 . this greatly increased the risk of cabin shrapnel from armor hits even when they didn't pierce . it also had cabin-mounted fuel tanks instead of mounting them outside the crew cabin behind a firewall like the m4 . this led to a far higher crew mortality rate in the t-34 . the high rate of interior shrapnel and lack of firewall between the crew and fuel tanks caused a lot of dead crew from rapidly spreading cabin fires . this was further exacerbated in the t-34 by its cramped cabin making bailing out a slower process than in the m4 . to explain just how bad survivability was , we don't have numbers from ww2 but we do from the korean war . north korean t-34 crew had an * 85 % mortality rate * when their tanks were destroyed because they were unable to bail and burned alive . it's the lowest survival rate of any tank in history . the m4 had the lowest crew mortality in ww2 . when an m4 was destroyed on average only 15 % of the crew died due to the anti-spalling , firewall , and multiple bailing options . additionally , even late war t-34 tanks had transmission issues . early t-34 tanks had an extremely low to speed of only 8mph due to a frankly awful transmission . later models had a much improved transmission that allowed a 15mph speed but it was still a slow medium tank that really couldn't leverage its relatively potent engine . also , t-34 reliability was nothing short of abysmal from soviet reports . this is partially due to the red army's lack of recovery vehicles but in some cases groups would lose 40 % of their tanks before encountering combat . some armored groups recommended rebuilding the engine if it had run more than 30 hours and an assault was expected . conversely , the roughly 4000 m4 tanks provided to the soviet union via the lend-lease program were praised as being extremely reliable , fast , slow to burn , easy to escape , and with a sufficient if not noteworthy gun . however , they were noted as being easy to tip over if not careful . the t-34 gun is an outright tragedy because it's fantastic but in practice had only slightly better penetration than the m4 75mm and worse than the 76mm . the was due to the ammunition the red army issued with it using a low grade of powder because it was cheaper . the t-34 gun was only marginally better than the early m4 gun and worse than the late m4 gun and that's honestly tragic because it's a really good design . the t-34 was also extremely loud and while it had a frankly excellent gunnar's sight which made accurate long range shots a breeze its wide angle sight was awful . so it was largely blind and deaf much of the time . this was made even worse by it not having a radio phone mount like the m4 , so communicating with troops was a nightmare . the t-34 honestly had a lot of major design flaws . i don't think it's fair to say it's as good as the m4 which was arguably the best medium tank of the entire war ."

9473,> people would throw hands to be the host for russian officers on account of how entertaining they were story time !
9474,i'm all ears if you have some entertaining russian officer stories .
9475,"come on nomansskywasalright , don't leave us like this !"
9476,as far as i know they still have this program . i know russians still visit the us at least .
9477,"this makes for a good story but unfortunately says more about how these programs have shortfalls than the state of russian launch capability a fixed set of silos and facilities were called out in this agreement - unsurprisingly a bunch of these facilities went out of action and in to a state of disrepair not long after . even if you took the current failure rates of guided missiles ukraine has been taking damage , theres a huge proportion of russias arsenal that could cause untold damage to the world . the more pressing point is - beyond being a bogeyman to limit nato intervention ( a very useful role that could be accomplished a lot cheaper than the current nuclear investments russia are making ) theres no clear benefit to russia using them directly on ukraine ."
9478,ayyyy finally something i can say i learned about ! i visited the minuteman missile national historic site in south dakota a year or so ago and it was dope . the website has tons about this topic .
9479,"true , but it changes putins calculus significantly . the only thing worse than the world watching missiles failing to launch , is missiles launching and then falling out of the sky and on to russia . both are serious , serious possibilities here , and either would make every single threat russia ever makes from here to the end of time be absolutely toothless . ukraine will march straight to moscow . we all know they dont have 6,000 nuclear weapons left . they might have 600 or 60 , but the * appearance * of having 6,000 is the strongest thing they have right now ."
9480,"well ... kinda . depends how advanced your anti icbm systems are . my understanding is that they're pretty secure in the us , and would need to be overwhelmed for the mainland to get hit . so you'd need many more than one . unless they shoot at ukraine or germany or something . then i have no idea ."
9481,"launch and detonate . but yes , they may have 100 , but they only need 1 to actually work as intended ."
9482,so says the russian propaganda . this is the effect that the russians were hoping for . fear of mighty russia .
9483,"edit : nobody seems to be able to read far in my comment . i'm refuting the claim that a single launched icbm would mean the end of the world . that's all . a single launch wouldn't trigger mad . it would trigger a massive war,yes , but it would take the launching of all capable icbms along with the failure of intercept to trigger mad . the us and other countries all have multiple vectors for intercept at almost all stages of an icbms trajectory ( excluding boost phase ). that is all . end of what ? a city ? it's awful , but i mean , two have already gone off in cities and the world keeps on turning . i still agree with your sentiment though , one going off in a decent sized city would cause more causalities than pretty much all wars since vietnam ."
9484,"thats not how icbms work . russia would need to launch their entire strategic arsenal for it to be effective . nuclear launch sites and missile quantities are planned out and coordinated to overwhelm defenses . there is an expected intercept rate , so enough quantity has to be launched to saturate missile defense systems and still get some through . if russia launched only one missile , it would 100 % be intercepted before it had time to hurt anyone . this is why north korea isnt a real threat either . given there has been 40-50 years of weapons progress in the west since russia actually did anything new , i would guess a 60-70 % launch rate would result in 100 % intercepts . the aegis ballistic missile defense system and all the others like it are no joke . the russian launch sites , flight paths , and targets have been studied to death . this is why missile submarines are the crux of nuclear deterrents . they can be anywhere and are much harder to intercept . also why russia is still trying to hang in the submarine game above all else . again , i feel decently confident that us forces have this under control . especially right now . if the ballistic missile subs are mission capable ( questionable ) i still doubt any of their payload would reach the usa ."
9485,do not ask about missing russian nukes . you will not enjoy the story .
9486,"this are no inches . nobody outside us uses your freedom units . left is 11mm , right is 8mm ."

9504,"an engineer who is having something machined can do 2 primary things to make the machining process easier : simplify geometry and loosen tolerances . in cases like this , where the part is so far out of tolerance as to be plainly visible to the naked eye , it has gone far beyond the engineer's responsibility . i would guess that someone who had no idea what they were doing decided to turn this part to dimension without using a center . but , honestly , it's so far out that even that seems unlikely . you'd need to turn down so much damn material to get it that far out just by turning the exterior . an engineer shouldn't design parts assuming this level of incompetency in production . it would make the design process way too difficult ."
9505,"i'm gonna guess this is at a workshop where captured vehicles are being refurbished and ukrainian technicians actually know what quality control is , so they're less than impressed . ukrainian ssr was responsible for producing a significant part of the soviet defense industry so they've probably been manufacturing spare parts themselves and gun barrels are parts that need to be replaced on a regular basis , especially during intensive use ."

9573,"do you blame them - it's no fun to say your height is 1.x meters . totally joking , don't hate me ."
9574,"plumbing is all over the shop with the imperial measurements too . we measure waste pipes in inches , copper tube in metric but it's back to imperial for steel tube . threads are in imperial measurements and so are the tappings on connections of course ."

9595,"i have zero concern that we'd do an all-out strike in response , given that situation . check out the russian 1983 nuclear incident . they saw that we had launched , but questioned the veracity of it , and didn't strike back in return . i would think that our us personnel would have the same questioning attitude . plus , even if we do strike back , i imagine the call would be made to strike back * in kind *, not all out . there isn't some trigger-happy lunatic behind the nuclear buttons , guys ."

9655,bit of both i think 
9656,large boulder the size of a small boulder .
9657,metric is pretty much it . time and distance are based on speed of light . mass is defined in relation to the standard kilo but that's the only ' arbitrary ' constant .
9658,interestingly enough us americans are stuck on the imperial system because the guy who was supposed to pitch our government the idea of using metric got captured by pirates and held for ransom on his way back from europe . absolutely wild how we're all stuck measuring life with less optimized units hundreds of years later because fucking jack sparrow knicked the messenger . it actually happened in the caribbean too .
9659,dont worry . we have our own fucked up mess . do forget we crashed a spacecraft on mars because we had one group working in metric and another in imperial .
9660,i think the brits still measure wine in hogsheads iirc .
9661,that makes sense 6.4mm ! it didn't have a #
9662,"this is exactly the quote i was thinking of using as an example , but couldnt remember it completely and didnt feel like looking it up ."
9663,"admittedly i was fairly deep in the land of what if's but i guess i was wondering whether or not you thought "" attempted nuclear war "" ( successful or otherwise ) was in the same ballpark as actually starting a nuclear war and i picked northern australia for some of the reasons you mentioned but also because we're kind of out of the way and not sure if you would start a nuclear war over . bit different if they hit somewhere like guam/hawaii or japan etc ."
9664,"if it were consistent , marijuana would be measured in stones ."
9665,""" consistent "". sure , sure . how many washing machines to a swimming pool ? and are those measures of volume , area or distance ?"
9666,we call it freedom units over here buddy !
9667,"long and short tons are imperial , a tonne is metric and there isn't a long and short tonne , just 1000kg ."
9668,please please lets leave amber herd out of this .
9669,i am looking forward to the reports when ukraine is willing to share
9670,"in mr . burns own voice , excellent. "
9671,slava ukrayini 
9672,"when ukraines final pushback comes ( ejection of russia from kherson , fording the dnieper ) that is going to be unfathomably blood business ."
9673,"very intriguing all of those places far behind the front lines between nova kakhovka and melitopol getting hit and on fire . ( himars ?) we know the uaf has access to satellite surveillance data provided by the u.s . to identify targets to attack ( both classified spysats and commercial imagery from companies like maxar ), but oftentimes those target sets require verification from other sources , like eyes on the ground . could this be a clue as to how extensive the ukrainian resistance / partisans network really is behind russian lines ? really cool ."
9674,operation bitches leave has begun .
9675,"note : firms activity has greatly increased from yesterday indicating the start of a large counteroffensive . the objective of these strikes are probably to hit logistic lines or barracks . yesterday multiple videos of [ himars ]( m270 were posted . the isw has been noting this for some days now . extract from their analysis released yesterday : "" ukrainian forces are likely preparing to launch or have launched a counteroffensive in kherson oblast as of july 23 , but open-source visibility on the progress and tempo of the counteroffensive will likely be limited and lag behind events . note 2 : for people saying this can be attributed to summer time : compare the firms map from [ today ]( one from the same day in [ 2021 ]( it has to be noted that temperatures across europe are way hotter this year . even considering this there are is an abnormal amount of fires in southern ukraine compared to the rest of the country/area"
9676,good luck to any russians on the right bank of the dnipro . it seems fairly clear that the tide has shifted back to ukraine's favor in the south .
9677,"my thoughts are with you all , warriors of ukraine ."
9678,"red = hi mum . yellow = operator starsky . green = being smoked . ukrainian territory all of it . kyiv , is older than ruzzia itself . edit : uk resident , i have lived an open and free life . nuff said . ( sips tea ) edit edit edit . if i was 100 meters away from a front line , i would have a tape measure ."
9679,good luck and lots of success to the ukrainian forces . slava ukraini ! heroiam slava ! may you crush the fascist russian troops and reclaim your land !
9680,i see nothing here . hi mum .
9681,if you want to see a more accurate map of the frontline use the [ interactive isw map ]( i posted this as it overlaps firms data preety neatly
9682,"when it is an "" offensive "" rather than a "" counteroffensive "" then you will know ukraine is making "" the "" push . generally the ukrainian military uses the word "" offensive "" when they are running an outright planned attack , vs counteroffensive when they are counterpunching in a local area or conducting reconnaissance in force probing for weaknesses . up to now , even with the activity in the northeast sector ukaine is really just extending their opportunistic actions - they found a potential exploit and are running with it . now a counteroffensive can become a full fledged offense if the enemy buckles enough . but normally in a true offensive one is looking to keep what it holds , whereas since march ukraine has mainly been focused on degrading enemy combat capability and demoralizing the enemy , vs being stuck on holding many of the villages and terrain it enters . the situation is similar in the north and north east kharkiv area . both sides are patrolling some areas in force , but not being stuck ( particularly ukraine ) on holding a village . its why places like ternova "" flip "" back and forth . russian move in , ukraine hits them , russians are destroyed or run , it gets reported , then ukraine pulls its tdf back as it is extended or exposed if it stays put ."
9683,"this counter offensive is a test for ukr . offense defense is different . itll be a huge test , i hope it goes well ."
9684,the firms points are fairly evenly distributed . certainly not concentrated along the front lines .
9685,the mods removed my post for posting this yesterday and said it was too low effort .
9686,"any news on that encirclement that was rumored to be up to three russian battle groups containing as many as 2,000 soldiers plus their equipment ? please don't answer me if this causes any ops security issues for the ukrainians ."
9687,what happened to the 2000 russian soldiers who were trapped ?
9688,"himars are going to have a long , bountiful night of hunting . beware the night furies , orcs !"
9689,"the eastern ' fires ' to me they mean they are bombing all the russian supplies that could get to kherson in a matter of days . it does not mean they are pushing there , it just means they want to ensure no major supplies can reach kherson in the next week or so . if i were the ukrainians i would even fake an offensive on the western side to delay the russian response even more ."
9690,"fuck this is like being five and waiting for christmas . at this point im building a sense of , not certainty but , its like prepping for painting . ukraine is spending so much time taping all the edges and cutting in , that once the actually use the rollers the whole wall will go from 20 % done to 90 % in a few moments . you know its coming and you cant rush the process or you may make a mistake . its a true test of patience for the entire world ."
9691,"that's a remarkable amount of fire south of the kakhovka reservoir , which i wouldn't expect to be relevant to the counter artillery battle , preliminaries against defenses , or near enough to railroads/roads to be useful ammo/fuel depots . everything south of the road marked ' m-14 ' , except within \~ 80km of the kherson front , would be outside gmlrs range . possibly something else going on there ..."
9692,"looks like theyre working on the key roads north of the dnipro . if ua can cut those , they could trap a large number of orcs on that side of the river . they might be able to escape by boats or swimming , but they cant get heavy weapons out ."
9693,prayers for ukraine !!!
9694,i realized some people are observing this war like its a sports game .
9695,"i pray to god in heaven that ukraine may defeat this wicked invasion that it has thus far admirably resisted . urkainians , chechens , tatars , belarussians , free russians , and citizens from every western nation march in the ua's ranks - and must succeed for the sake of the western world . goodspeed , ukraine ."
9696,"ok hear me out ... it might be crazy to read or even unthinkable thing to think about but ... summer in south of ukrainian steppe region is actually hot . every summer there is forest fires in local forestry ( even without war ). not every military vehicle on european roads is "" for ukraine "" and not every fire is burning russians ."
9697,sounds like the invaders are going to get battered ! slava ukraini 
9698,is there a map indicating the ammo dumps that have been destroyed as well as what may still exist in operation ?
9699,give them fucking hell boys . no mercy on the battlefield !
9700,god help our warriors .
9701,"what are they bombing those far lands with ? or are those wildfires ? do they have that many long range artillery ? thing is , now there are even more fires in that north of crimea / east of kherson / west of melitopol . what are they also aiming for there ?"
9702,lets fucking gooo
9703,"wasn't expecting anything major until mid august , but if this is truly the big push , i wonder what sort of assets zsu has positioned behind enemy lines in the form of special forces and partisans . my biggest worry is energodar . hoping there's no fighting there and ruzzians either withdraw or get cut off and surrender . but if kherson is retaken , putler will face a lot of very big questions at home ."
9704,"yeah that's a ton of red spots way behind the lines , it'd seem odd for himars to have that many targets to strike , causing that many fires . something else might be going on ."
9705,can someone explain the legend / dots . i'm not understanding
9706,we need to sink some more of these god damn missile boats the orcs keep using
9707,"russia , this is a gesture of good-will . ;)"
9708,i hope this is the actual counter attack and not a limited attack that just fizzles out after a few days
9709,"yeah ... don't trust anything with "" deep state "" in it ."
9710,"find a new name for this . deep state is a conspiracy theory bullshit set piece used by american right wing trump supporters . in north america , anything saying it is from ' deep state ' isn't to be trusted . if this is really trustworthy and you want to keep american support instead of dividing it , find a better name ."
9711,why don't they just blow that crimea bridge up .
9712,"i think it's time to reuse a well known phrase which hopefully will ring true this time : "" we have only to kick in the door and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down. let's hope the combination of accurate long-range weapons and a bunch of determined ukrainians pissed off about the killing and destruction of their country will be enough to give that door a good kicking ."
9713,do you think if russia properly loses he might use small nukes ?
9714,kick all the ass ! push those orc fucks back to their holes
9715,best of luck to all the brave fighters in ukraine 
9716,"well , i'm off to bed at 1am . maybe i will read about this tomorrow morning"
9717,does anyone understand the map legend ? what is 24-48 .?
9718,all the bridges are damaged . ivan's fucked .
9719,yes this is awesome to hear . the momentum has shifted and the russians can't stop ukraine from taking back lost territory . it's only a matter of time before russia withdraws from ukraine in a humiliating defeat . the more western aid packages that keep coming into ukraine the faster the ukrainian army will be able to dismantle the russian offenses .
9720,"if i were the russian general i would withdraw across the dnieper river except at kherson . force the ukrainians into bloody and costly urban warfare . the ua concentrated most of their armor into this offensive , forcing them into street fighting is a great way to use them up and the russians still have the firepower advantage despite the concentration of force the ukrainians have amassed . it'll inflict heavy losses and most importantly take away any momentum the ukrainian advance would have had ."
9721,"slava ukraini ! there are two maps being used . deepstates and liveuamap , they have differences . in the end , ukraine has to be hitting the orcs ."
9722,fuck em rough
9723,there is nothing in print or media that you can believe during war . one must wait for proof .
9724,long strings of russia's goodwills are coming
9725,where ?? everything looks the same as it was for weeks
9726,do you have a link to the deep state map ?
9727,give them hell !
9728,"i read about 1 million soldiers . haha , propaganda is a funny thing ."
9729,"ru mod soon : we left the entire cherson area because people there want to stay living under ' kiev regime '. as an act of goodwill , we will let ukrainians solve their own problems !"""
9730,who the fuck decided in this day and age of paranoia and fake news it was a good idea to name their map website deep state ?
9731,300km range hits around crimea should be already ongoing as well . panic needs to be created there too at the same time . once avalanche starts rolling it has to go all the way to the clif called nazi kerch bridge . momentum .
9732,kherson is ukraine give the cockroach occupiers the hell they deserve !
9733,matt groening ? did you just out yourself ? edit : harry shearer was the voice of mr burns
9734,geroyam slava 
9735,"the ukrainians can do it . they know this land much better than the rashist ever will . they have something to fight for , and also are being supplied with incredibly powerful and strategic weapons and supplies to take back their land . i do agree that it will be very costly , but the cost of freedom isn't free unfortunately ."
9736,"when they cut the north crimean canal the crimea will be unsustainable for the russians , nice ."
9737,mostly ruscist blood .
9738,"the collapse of morale will be a bloodbath . the russians will just run and leave all the equipmentbut im more curious about what the separatists who actually believe in their cause will do during the confusion . no working equipment , no backup , just a rifle and misplaced beliefs while your saviors high tail it behind your families thinking theyre doing the right thing and catching a bullet to the face while covering a bunch of idiots who get to safety with stolen toilet seats and the retreating russians dont even have a fucking toilet to put it on . you cant make this shit up ."
9739,lol no . you dont ford the dnipro . you push south to melitpol and they ceed control of land east of dnipro because of supply lines being cut or risk mass encirclement .
9740,"no , russia will abandon kherson themselves . because their situation is becoming unsustainable . you cant hold such huge front without solid logistics ."
9741,"i doubt that they will try to cross the dnieper in kherson oblast ( except crossing the dam at nova kakhovka and gaining control of that area ) . once they control the right bank of the dnieper i guess they will fortify that side quite with just enough manpower , then shift their units across the river up at zaporizjzja and push down hard to melitopol and cut the russian supply lines into two distinct areas . then they can go for berdyansk in one direction and the area north of crimea in the other . just getting control of nova kakhovka and cutting the water supply to crimea will make the supply situation for russia that much worse"
9742,"pretty sure they have access to nato intelligence , not just us"
9743,it was a while ago but a kyiv indepdent article said that melitpol is barely held by russia such is the partisan activity .
9744,"it has been crazy hot in the past week , could some of them actually be wildfires ?"
9745,\* operation bye bitch
9746,can you fly * vladdy *?
9747,supposedly a strike on a russian base at chulakivk southwest of kherson and across the dnipro : edit : southeast changed to southwest
9748,> note 2 : for people saying this can be attributed to summer time : compare the firms map from todayand one from the same day in 2021 . it has to be noted that temperatures across europe are way hotter this year . even considering this there are is an abnormal amount of fires in southern ukraine compared to the rest of the country/ar i believe these fires are absolutely the result of the counter offensive . that said i also wouldnt be surprised if accidental fires have also increased substantially since 2021 because of the invasion . a lot of critical infrastructure has been hit and people have been forced to leave so its probably a lot harder to have operational fire departments especially in occupied areas compared to 2021 . additionally infrastructure damage and the difficulty of performing basic maintenance may also result in more fires started by downed power lines or other electric issues . in russia weve already seen an increase in wildfires the army was one of the main sources of manpower to fight them and with the russian army in ukraine more small towns in russia are being threatened by fires . there are countless tragedies from this war and more widespread fires is just another one on the long list .
9749,you are wrong if you actually check firms data map most fires are over 24hrs old .
9750,"i bet western satellites have given them a bunch of nice maps with gps coordinates to plug into himars ; barracks here with twenty troops , supply trucks there , etc ."
9751,"there's currently a heatwave going across . that's obviously highly variable , you can't compare by date across years ."
9752,russia is merely withdrawing as a gesture of good will without letting their troops know first
9753,"english is not my main language , can you explain what you just wrote about the colours ? i see a lot of upvotes but i honestly dont understand what you mean"
9754,"is there a reason you have cropped non occupied areas from the map . firms was developed to spot wild fires and it is the middle of a hot dry summer in ukraine . in order to draw some context from the fires behind the front lines , we need to see the complete area ."
9755,yeah ive never understood the mods of this page at times when it comes to relevant to ukraine requirements . example being posts about idf strikes on warehouse of iran drones being supplied to russia . pretty sure thats relevant .
9756,i think sometimes the mods here need to chill and let more info in . sometimes it looks like there are personal animosities . i've tried to post vids from denys davydov as they are usually rather helpful summaries but they always get removed .
9757,"this sub is over-moderated . let the community decide whats important and low-effort , not preemptively ban everything in a seemingly random manner ."
9758,it was a wild twitter rumor .
9759,"2000 troops(if it is that many ) is not an easy number to take even if trapped . think of azovstal , that took a month . granted where these russians are trapped(if indeed they are trapped ) wont be as well fortified as that . still,,2000 is hard to take . thats why the 40-50 surrenders were so exciting . if it continued .."
9760,it was a twitter rumor .
9761,they were given 48 hours and only 24hours i think have passed or maybe they managed to flee despite the risk of artillery fire .
9762,[
9763,"yeah ... like me , a ukrainian honestly i wake up every day hoping to see russia loose even more"
9764,well this can be easily seen comparing the firms map from [ today ]( and one from the same day in [ 2021 ]( it has to be noted that temperatures across europe are way hotter this year . even considering this there are is an abnormal amount of fires in southern ukraine compared to the rest of the country/area
9765,hi : i am not aware of anyone keeping an updated map although several interim maps have been posted as july has progressed . but [ another post is running an updated list of ammo dumps and c&c that get hit by strikes ]( insofar as i am aware it is the most comprehensive list being tallied . i like it as for each hit the op of that post links the image/video proof .
9766,"each dot is a fire or a "" hotspot "" temperature-wise . in other words , hot enough to be fire or coals ."
9767,"they are going to do whatever makes tactical sense and they are receiving the best intel in the world so any "" fizzling "" is going to be intentional because it favors ukraines war effort ."
9768,"it's literraly just a map with fire data , there are no comments news , etc ... its just a map ."
9769,"it would be extremely difficult to do with the current weaponry , even within range ."
9770,they gotta take back kherson first
9771,because there arent ukrainian troops remotely near the bridge .
9772,"1.6 million ukrainian soldiers died fighting against hitler and the axis and its hard to imagine how the soviet union could have won without the heroism of ukrainian troops along with the troops from other soviet states like belarus , estonia , latvia and lithuania . quoting hitler and saying it will hopefully ring true is both disrespectful to the ukrainians who died in wwii and it plays directly into putins warped narrative that it was russia that won wwii and that ukrainians today are nazis . the quote also doesnt seem to be true from a military perspective and ukrainian leaders arent operating with the assumption that this will be an easy or quick victory ."
9773,they would be the only ones on the planet that didn't see it coming .
9774,it was 3 weeks ago . kaboom . like a fucking disney + intro .
9775,"zelensky himself gave orders to retake the south so this is no secret . also the isw has been noting this for some days now . extract from their analysis released yesterday : "" ukrainian forces are likely preparing to launch or have launched a counteroffensive in kherson oblast as of july 23 , but open-source visibility on the progress and tempo of the counteroffensive will likely be limited and lag behind events ."""
9776,i think they are already aware of it .
9777,they'll surely look at reddit in order to figure that out after the first artillery shells hit .
9778,the orcs know before us don't worry bout it .
9779,"if they do even china and india won't be able to watch the other side anymore , that would lead certainly to at least secondary sanction and the complete isolation of russia ( maybe north korea would still entertain relation and nothing more ). ukraine would see an incredible amount of new weapon from the west aa , fighters of every type , long range himars ."
9780,russia has been consistently telling their people that this isnt a real war and were totally winning. if they were to use nukes it would be a huge sign of weakness and it would be such an escalation that it may trigger full scale nato intervention which would certainly spell the end of the putin regime . for those reasons its unlikely russia would use nukes . if russia were to use nukes i would also expect two preconditions . the first would be full scale mobilization . this would be an escalation from russia and a big political risk but may help militarily . putin doesnt want to go this route but if russia could fully mobilize and win without nukes it would be far preferable than either losing or using nukes . if putin hasnt mobilized then the odds of nuclear warfare are very very low . the second precondition is an adjustment in russias official nuclear doctrine . countries with nukes have publicly available nuclear doctrines that clearly outline the conditions that would trigger a use of a nuclear weapon . the clear ability to know when a country will or will not use nukes is one of the main reasons we havent seen nuclear war . if russia is actually serious about using nukes they would first change their nuclear doctrine so that the rest of the world knows that they are on the table . this way other countries may back down and russia might be able to achieve their goals . if russia doesnt adjust their doctrine then they are essentially telling the other countries that they are bluffing .
9781,the wind would spread the radiation across borders so a nuke attack on ukraine is an attack on their neighbors too which includes belarus and russia .
9782,"ukrainian for "" hour "" is "" "" ( godina ). it tells you how old the fires are . note that there is an english version of the map online ."
9783,"armored offense and urban terrain do not mix . i would hope they would bypass and encircle the urban areas and go for deep , violent penetration of the orc line ."
9784,"i would love it if the us secretly supplied the long range weapons while claiming the won't and stating "" nothing to do with us "" when the evidence is obvious ."
9785,what 300km range hits are you talking about ?
9786,where are they getting the 300km ? afaik the us has denied supplying ukraine with missiles of that range .
9787,blow the bridge !!! force mass surrender of trapped russian forces . the humiliation will wreck russian support .
9788,he's never voiced mr . burns .
9789,"kick-ass , slava ukraini ..!!"
9790,"> they know this land much better did you see the recent revelation that the russians had maps from the 60's , even if it wasn't their home turf i'd guess the ukrainians would still have that edge"
9791,"also they have the benefit of two things that russia doesnt , they have competent people , and they had time to plan"
9792,if they had more time i dont think it would even need to be that bloody . have they lost any caesars ? have they lost any pzh ? have they lost any himars ? that these pieces of equipment can continuously reach out and touch russia without being touched back means they could grind them into nothing and sweep them up . unfortunately different times of the year its very hard to mount an offensive in ukraine so they cant just sit back and pick russia apart .
9793,"judging by the firms map , the himars are out of range for most of the strike happening between kherson and melitopol ( novobohdanivka fe .), so either : \- the range is above 100km for the himars ( possible ) \- they already pushed to tokmak \- it's another high range system ( tochka ?)"
9794,they should take crimea back too . then secure the borders and make sure orcs are destroyed upon returning . then work with the international community to rebuild ukraine even better with money seized from russian oligarchs
9795,"i'm hoping for this . - himars causes the russian front to be severely weakened . - ukraine advances before russia figures out how to deal / store their ammo dumps or figures out logistics . - by the time they figure it out , ukraine makes their new ammo dumps invalid . starts destroying them with himars too now that they're in range . - hopefully , is being given atacms ( long range himars rockets ) and starts hitting russia with those too - thereby confusing the hell out of them . if the above happens , it could really cause the russians to fall back fast . would be lovely to see ..."
9796,"yeah , i expect a lot of doomed rearguard type stuff , of ill-trained and poorly-equipped ethnic conscripts hung out to dry with minimal air support , shitty armor , and devastated supply lines while the ethnic russians high-tail it back east ."
9797,\* black orc blood
9798,"> im more curious about what the separatists who actually believe in their cause will do during the confusion . they will probably try to flee with the russians , just like the collaborators in ww2 fled with the germans in western-europe . cowards are the same in any era ."
9799,"actually , a toilet seat works great in an outhouse ."
9800,"> what the separatists who actually believe in their cause will do during the confusion . kherson did not have any separatist movement . ps even in lnr/dnr areas , most separatist "" soldiers "" are forcibly conscripted , so i'd not expect many true believers even there .."
9801,> but im more curious about what the separatists who actually believe in their cause will do during the confusion . a lot of them are forced conscripts .
9802,"you realize you have to fortify positions , right ?"
9803,"if the antonivka bridge is cut , then how are they going to retreat ? that is quite a lot of troops to ferry over the dnipro . not to mention their tanks , etc .."
9804,also ukraine has very good intelligence even without nato . there are still tons of ukrainians living in occupied areas who have contact with the ukrainian forces and can feed them information on russian troop placements . the rise of social media and smart phones means that basically everyone who is a teenager or older is potentially a ukrainian spy . there are also probably a few turncoats within the russian army itself who are feeding information to ukrainian forces .
9805,""" bitches , leave "" is a quote from the movie * robocop *"
9806,i think something else is going wrong there . a lot is out of reach for ukrainian artillery and i've heard the farmers have been burning the wheat field now while they do that later in the year . maybe this can also be a sort of partisan warfare .
9807,"i'm british , and even i don't understand what he said ."
9808,"he is just being funny , using every word or thing that was popular recently and assigning them to the dots . slava ukraini !"
9809,yellow and blue make sense .
9810,"he means that the red dots on the map are ruzzian positions . "" hi mum "" alludes to the fact that ruzzians keep calling their moms whenever something bad happens to/around them . yellow dots are [ ukrainian ]( positions . and the green-marked territory is what was recently recovered by ukraine . i'm not a native english speaker either , but i wouldn't have noticed that the red dots are in full retreat to the right , if it wasn't for this explanation . edit : i think those are actually bombing positions , not personnel positions . ruzzian personnel is represented by the piggy icons ?"
9811,i wanted to put a second photo of fires in the [ 21 of july ]( to make a comparison but the map just broke idk why ([ today ]( although some fires may be attributed to the summer the change in intensity is too big . also compare the firms map from [ today ]( one from the same day in [ 2021 ]( it has to be noted that temperatures across europe are way hotter this year . even considering this there are is an abnormal amount of fires in southern ukraine compared to the rest of the country/area
9812,"not op but ... i made the last week of firms data into a shitty gif which is zoomed out to contain the whole of ukraine . it loops but see the timeline at the bottom . link to firms below for others to investigate . imho there is a bit of a jump in hotspots in the kherson oblast area in the last couple days , but it isn't 100 % conclusive evidence . but given ukrainians are saying that it is happening , it seems that something could be starting to me at least ."
9813,"also removed a post about [ china and russia creating a joint effort to create a "" reserve currency ""]( like that's not relevant in the current sanctions environment ."
9814,"well it's a little more complex . azovstal defenders had a massive bunker complex , where russians have ... an empty field . maybe some bombed out houses ."
9815,i heard just now that it still is a possibility that 2000 soldiers are trapped . but because its critical front line information nobody will publish it until its done . so there is still hope
9816,"are you saying that arestovich would just post unsubstantiated twitter rumors and risk his 100 % credibility ? i refuse to believe that , and i expect further comments from him about the encirclement . no chance that he will just jump to another big victory and never mention encirclement in vysokopilye ever again ."
9817,yeah i do too 
9818,"just saying . not every region got into news every summer because of forests burning like kherson . may be some regions up north with its turf but those where more like random time limited events rather then "" good old tradition "" like with kherson every year . >! still cant forget how for some time in the middle of summer skies turned dark from smoke of burning local forestry . "" its just forest burning "" grandpa told me !<"
9819,thanks much !
9820,he made a very good point . saying anything is deep state will make americans not trust the information very quickly . its a loaded word here .
9821,"lol ... yea , when depot after depot goes up in a ball of flame it's kinda hard not to arrive at the conclusion something's different ."
9822,thats on top of deep state maps already time-delaying their maps in general .
9823,"i think china would say one thing and do another , under the table"
9824,i think nato would go after certain individuals involved in executing the launch/strike .
9825,volunteers supplied them so nothing to do with the country itself .
9826,"what im not understanding is , doesn't ukraine have long range themselves ? another problem with long range ( ballistic ) missiles is that they are fairly easy to intercept compared to mlrs or himars . so my interpretation is , that 300km missiles are not effective currently while also giving away your position ."
9827,no confirmation yet that they have long range himars ammo right ? last thing i saw of it was some us official saying its just rumours . fog of war is thick
9828,"that's just my strategy combined with wishful thinking . i heard that us didn't and is not going to provide 300km range missiles . i believe , this is one of the wars where once nazis start running they won't ben interested in turning back as long as you keep charging , no matter what their fhrer says . less opportunities for resupply , hideouts and basics they have on that road to hell faster the blitz will end . crimea is part of that road to hell for ruskies bastards . hitting crimea now should make everyone think , everyone who shouldn't be there , from recent settlers to military staff . not everyone there thinks they are ukrainian . panic and confusion needs to be created and present in daily lifes in crimea , just as is for ukrainians in the rest of ukraine ."
9829,all in due time few months ago himars was off the table too
9830,who was it ? edit : did my own google search . chris collins . edit2 : harry shearer im great at the internet
9831,i havent but 100 % believe you .
9832,"it's not that recent , we found those maps with the first pows in the first days of invasion ."
9833,"the russian forces are definitely at a weak point . 2-3 weeks ago they were grinding out in lyschansks things were looking grim . ukraine has been training lots of soldiers and i believe they already have the longer range rockets . i think they are trying to lure russia into thinking they dont . then , when the russian adjust logistics points just outside the range they hit them hard again . i dont know just a thought i had ."
9834,"they've been using ground attack aircraft recently , maybe that's showing on firms ?"
9835,dont forget about the russians :
9836,"tochka has huge explosions ! gmlrs munitions for the m142 himars are absolutely insane for their range with a cep of 5 meters . i'm a bit ignorant to the precise differences , but would cream to start seeing tochka u and atacams barrages accompanied by f-16 air support . blow that fucking bridge !"
9837,himars can shoot 150km missiles .
9838,"not sure , but i think this is from a global fire map (?), if so some are hits some are fires . still doesn't account for so many in the center ."
9839,drive by kherson and take crimea . true blitz .
9840,"they've already moved a good chunk of the ammo dumps out of himars range . this is good because now it takes about half a day or longer for supplies to get to the front . they're also just out of range if himars so if the front moves a couple kilometres , the new dumps get visitors ."
9841,"odds are very high thats spot-on . the pure bloods have been consistently behind the lines , pushing the mixed breeds into the meat grinder , hoping to seize anything they can . theyll be the first to flee , throwing the dog meat behind them to delay pursuit ."
9842,"if ukraine has been training up the recruits since the war started , they have thousands of soldiers that have the same level of training as most american soldiers that hit normandy beaches . they will slice through the russians like a hot knife in the open southern terrain . i expect a blitzkrieg through the russian lines with rear guard accepting surrenders or mopping up as needed . this is going to be exciting . glory to ukraine ."
9843,"the black , stinking ichor of the damned"
9844,a lot of the so-called collaborators from ussr had good reason to fear stalin and the russians . like having their families slaughtered / starved / displaced / land stolen by russians . and true some were nazis who slaughtered the jews of their villages .
9845,when youre right youre right
9846,yup i was talking about in the donbas if/when theres a general collapse of morale
9847,"the true believers left in lnr/dnr at this point are old people , amputees , and fsb agents ."
9848,the push south will cause a collapse of everything west of the ukraine offense like what happened in kyiv . you do not risk an encirclement of thousands of troops and equipment because you have no bullets . ukraine needs only a few dozen km south to cut off crimea supplies to the entire southern sector . then everything in the west is effectively under siege . at that point no reason to try and hold the south as it just massacred troops and equipment gifted to ukraine .
9849,uaf just made it unusable for heavy armor . people still can cross it
9850,that's the cool thing . the tanks and heavy gear gets left behind . just like when they left kyiv and the north .
9851,"britain itself already knew everything about when the war starts , planned movements , and domestic affairs inside russia weeks ahead ."
9852,"im american and i dont know what hes saying . then again , i like to speak with a british accent sometimes so i can say cunt without repercussions ."
9853,"i'm op and i don't . i'm the person making or trying to make the world a bit of a better place , because i don't go around blowng the fuck out of the people around me . look after you community , they are all you have . sparky ."
9854,"i am an old uk man , protected the people around me for entirety of my life , never blew them up/killed anybody even though i could of . i protect people around me . i don't destroy them for a boat ."
9855,you understand that ?.....
9856,"i understand . it's just that i used eodis and other eo data for my msc , and i remember all the times i jumped to conclusions until i looked at comparable datasets "
9857,"yup , and thats why i mentioned that . just saying 2000 is still hard to take without calling in air strikes . not saying it cant be done . really pointing to my own stupidity than anything because first day i heard about it i expected the next day to wake to read they had them , then another day passed and i was wth?! and then it clicked . 2000 is a lot . its formidable . theyll get them . but they need to be smart about it ."
9858,"im here glued and waiting , that will be a tremendous victory . "
9859,"> are you saying that arestovich would just post unsubstantiated twitter rumors and risk his 100 % credibility ? yes . > his 100 % credibility ? lmfao , please , this man should be taken with a tablespoon of salt ."
9860,"yeah , it's unfortunate , but the only words in the us that are more associated with crazy than "" deep state "" are "" flat earth ."""
9861,did you see the video of the orcs running from 1 of these attacks ?.....
9862,china doesnt know what to do yet . but china wants stability ( stability it controls ) whereas russia thrives on chaos .
9863,yea . us would also announce it officially beforehand as they did with all weapons systems .
9864,they are not getting the 300km yet . us said it a few days ago . google it the west does not want this to escalate to ww3 .
9865,"oh yeah , the morale in the enemy and the state of disorganisation as well as local reserves of shells destroyed seems to me means that actually ukraines window of opportunity is now . they seem to be cautious but holding off for a better time could be a mistake as the longer this goes on , increases the chance say of re-equipping from deep reserves , general mobilisation , or china coming to russia's rescue with vast supplies of drones and other equipment . don't need 300 km missiles if you move your lines 200 km . no need to mop up every pocket of resistance on the way , go after the armour . the rest will give up ."
9866,maybe theyll lob some more tochka now .
9867,us might provide 150km range missiles .
9868,never say never .
9869,they did just approve 100 million to teach them to fly f-16s . so that would be pretty fucking sick .
9870,what communists are you referring to ??
9871,more profit the longer it drags out . im shocked they have enough for an offensive . i think oil companies are pushing for it to work out so they can go extract the oil and gas . western europe and usa fossil fuels have big time interest in this . between mic wanting slow grinding cash register and oil companies is the speed of helpful gear arriving .
9872,> im great at the internet an upvote for the chuckle you gave me . at least you got there in the end . : d
9873,here's the post about it
9874,"ah i only saw it recently , my bad"
9875,"i am sorry , we ?"
9876,"the thing is , you might be right or wrong . the trouble for russia is , they dont know either . so they have to leave the ammo outside that longer range which fucks their logistics to the max . these fuckers are all dead men walking . glory to ukraine ."
9877,"that plus manual efforts to move all the munitions , orcs must have busiest day on field ."
9878,"correction - they stopped supplying the ammo dumps in himars range because they've all been blown up . to actually move tons of ammunition out of range by hand would be a huge undertaking . if they could have moved the dumps out of range , they would have done so within a week , not having 50 + get blown up over the period of a month ."
9879,and carrying as many tvs and toilets as they can .
9880,"i agree , and would go so far as saying that the very vocal build up to the kherson push has had the effect of drawing a lot of russian reinforcements in to the oblast . reportedly 13 btgs are dug in around the city outskirts . meanwhile ukraine hits supply lines constantly , then could then launch an offensive towards tokmak in the zaporizhzhia front . tokmak stands out as a very strategically important town well within realistic strike distance . it has a major railhead , and its capture would cut the rail line from rostov , cutting off kherson and everyone in it from supply from the east . i mean , thats something i would consider anyway "
9881,russia are incredibly dense ( read stupid incompetent murderous ) though and may not even recognize the danger until it happens .
9882,"ah , that would be australian , not british ."
9883,aha . your sobriety may be a factor here .
9884,"no problem , i also added the 2021 map , it didnt save in the last edit"
9885,i don't believe so . do you have a link ?
9886,"i really don't believe that the us revealed everything they gave ukraine . they shouldn't , and everybody's talking too much ."
9887,not necessarily . cointel is a thing . keeps em guessing .
9888,im not sure they would or need to .
9889,"why would * that * escalate it to ww3 , and not himars , and not the artillery , or the tanks , etc ? it's silly , arbitrary ."
9890,"yeah , we'd have to call it ww3 , just because . it rolls off the tongue better than "" ww lol vlad """
9891,they already do . we're waiting for the 300 .
9892,wtf ? that is spectacular .
9893,"there's this story , it's unconfirmed , but made me laugh a lot . allegedly , in those first days of the invasion the orcs tried to land on parachutes in some safe wooded area . but it was only wooded on maps , and that wood was cut down . but it was night time , they did not see right , landed in a clear field in full vew of uaf who promptly surrounded and captured all of them . true or not , that's how much we laughed at their use of old outdated maps ."
9894,"not me personally , "" we "" as in "" ukrainians ""."
9895,well she says shes ukrainian 
9896,"this is the way , even if ruzzia is right about something they won't know it lol ."
9897,yes that very good point !
9898,"you see , russians should not be fearing himars , himars will make your life easier . need to move some ammo ? call himars ! have a tank that you just don't want to be in anymore ? call himars ! have some vodka that needs to be drunk and you're just too busty doing other things ? call himars and they'll fix your issues !"
9899,i have stated this multiple times . kherson is the ultimate trap . a trap the enemy knows is a trap but must commit to . kherson is both militarily and politically massively important to russia . so they had to go all in to defend it . now suddenly the expertise ukraine is showing with the himars means all those btg are trapped on the wrong side of the river and out of the war . it would not suprise me if ukraine scales down activity west of dnipro and just wait for russians to surrender .
9900,"i believe the push towards tokmak has already started , you can see a pretty large clump of fire in the firms map under the "" green pocket "" north of tokmak"
9901,"ukrainian partisans blew up a russian-controlled railway near novobohdanivka , zaporizhia oblast , 30 km north of melitopol , overnight on july 23-24 . geolocated images of the aftermath show splits in a rail juncture in novobohdanivka that cuts off vasylivka and tokmak , zaporizhia oblast from the main rail line to melitpool.[26] ukrainian officials reported that russian forces use the rail line to transport equipment and personnel from melitopol towards vasylivka and tokmak.[27 ] from isw today .. i think you may have the town of the attack picked ."
9902,coolio then . they get encircled and mass surrender . still no need to fortify against them . push south fast and hard .
9903,"i'm no german , but pardon my french , wouldnt that be spanish ?"
9904,"[ british ( main london ) accent on ]: ah , you cunt , i was in london before the pandemic ( 1st time and it was awesomeso much history ); and ive watched plenty of movies made in our hollywood ; i know of which i speak ."
9905,they always announced prior to delivering new weapon systems . you need to have predictable reaction from the russians once those weapons are used . imagine if f16 flew in combat missions in ukraine and russians assume that it is american . it could start a nuclear war .
9906,not in this war . us is very much interested to make sure that there is no beginning of ww3 if russians confuse ukrainians with nato .
9907,they always do for diplomatic reasons . they want russians to know what us weapons ukrainians have before they are actually used .
9908,"as a former paratrooper myself , i somehow doubt this story . you never perform an airdrop in a wooded area . casualities would skyrocket , since a paratrooper , landing in a tree literally can get cut in two halfes . on the other hand : its the russians , they are stupid beyond any comparison and dont give a shit for their soldiers lifes ..."
9909,now imagine these idiots with nuclear weapons ?!
9910,i am ukrainian .
9911,because hes a fuckhead
9912,> wait for russians to surrender i worry about how the civilian population will be treated if russian troops are trapped and left alone .
9913,"they cant wait for that . if the southwest is not retaken before fall , it will be the deaths of far more people ( civilians mostly ) than if they assault now ."
9914,these are the geniuses that dug trenches in the red forest .
9915,"yeah , i agree : on one hand this story has way too many holes in it , plus not officially confirmed anywhere . on the other hand , russians are soooo stupid ... but i just like this story on its own , like a war-time anecdote . ps . did not know about cutting in two parts , how is it even possible ?"
9916,"back in the ' 60s a paratrooper landed by accident in a large tree in our back yard ( we were living on a military base in se asia ). i remember him hanging up about 20 ' above ground . mum made the parachute into a hammock for dad , which he used on patrol as company commander ."
9917,"another story from the beginning of war , that russians paratroopers who were supposed to perform an airdrop to odessa , landed in the cold sea and drowned . do not underestimate russian's stupidity"
9918,"theyve demonstrated frequently enough that yes , theyre that stupid ."
9919,"hi ukrainian , i'm dad . \* gets yeeted to siberia \*"
9920,what do you do ?
9921,"this isnt in the past big dog , its like , right now "
9922,"shes not saying the people 100 years ago , shes saying 3 months ago in a conflict thats ongoing , and i know you can tell the difference which means you just want to be a lil dookieboi"
9923,hence why ukraine will push to the outskirts of the city and use partisan intel to keep blowing up barracks within the city . if russia attacks the civilians the partisan movement and the general population raises up and attacks everything in the city while the ukraine army rushes in . look up the warsaw uprising in ww2 . such is the power of the people in urban combat .
9924,well how much worse could it get ? also the knowledge you may need to surrender and will face prison or a summary death sentence should be a deterrent .
9925,nor can ukraine commit to a full on urban combat . they cannot risk the man or material .
9926,"i live near a us army/national guard training camp . during night paratroop training , a pilot missed the drop zone & the troopers hit the trees . every er in the area was packed ."
9927,"around that time too , our neighbor ( in sea ) tried to invade & "" free "" us from a colonial power who were said meddling into our country affair . they sent paratrooper to land in area marked as secondary forest without knowingly it was planted with palm oils tree years early . guess that sharps thorn shreds their parachutes & got them hanging until get captured ."
9928,"that made me chuckle , you can stay "
9929,i am an english teacher by trade . also work as an online school administrator right now . basically smm .
9930,may i ask why the questioning ?
9931,you dont say ?
9932,i just think thats a little dishonest to say we when all you did was fuck all . dookieboy nice . is this what they called you at school before you became a pedo ?
9933,the warsaw uprising that got absolutely crushed ?
9934,"he didn't miss . nat guard pilots can be dicks sometime . like saying they have to fly nap of the earth with a full load of hung over ( and many still drunk ) paratroopers , when in fact they don't .... loadmaster to pilot on intercom : "" these hungover fucks are puking all over the place . i just cleaned the deck last night !"" pilot to loadmaster : "" put the cap on your spit bottle . imma drop the ramp ...."""
9935,"jesus , that's scary . i always thought if you hit a tree the worst that can happen is you get tangled in the branches and maybe get a few scratches . was the pilot all right in the end ?"
9936,true hero )
9937,theyre literally gatekeeping supporting ukraine . ignore them lol .
9938,you said we . i am just asking whos we and what did you do .
9939,"yes , this clearly all leads to me being a pedophile ."
9940,because the allies never showed up . imagine the same thing happening in kherson but the ukraine army like 5km from the city center . the absolute chaos of russian soldiers being attacked in every direction while the ukraine army pours in .
9941,ya they just leveled half the city . it was one of the only times the strumtiger was used in combat .
9942,"in addition , they've worn out the barrels and have no replacements , so the guns are starting to blow up ."
9943,"russian ammo truck drivers do an awful lot of praying to their maker these days . if the junk doesn't explode in their trucks , it predetonates "" in the barrel ."""
9944,if might paraphrase churchill the russians have been suffering from the rather childish delusion that they could shell ukraine and ukraine couldn't hit back . its not that russia is going to run out of shells any time soon its that this shouldn't be an issue at all . in spite of everything stacked against them the ukrainians are holding their own . russia was supposed to have the entire country in a week . i am glad the ukrainians proved them wrong .
9945,russia prefers to refer to it as detonating ahead of schedule. 
9946,it's almost like equipment specifically designed to fight russian artillery is working as it's supposed to ! now send more .
9947,blow those motherfuckers sky high . ukraine needs to win to save their identity and territory . the world needs to win to show that good always will triumph over evil .
9948,russian armament is the equivalent of harbor freight tools now
9949,[/ nelson muntz laugh ](
9950,in situ is always better than in your face .
9951,and their artillery can't hit anything because their barrels are shot .
9952,"> in a month of precise strikes , the ukrainians slowly-growing arsenal of himarsthe americans have pledged 18 of the launchershas destroyed a hundred high-value targets , an unnamed senior u.s . defense official told cnn on friday . that's * huge *. that's 100 ammo dumps , command posts , fuel depots , etc , up to 50 miles behind the front line . himars are undeniably changing the course of the war for the better ."
9953,"it's not that russia is running out of ammo , but they're running out of ammo on the front lines . russia has a butt ton of ammo stored from the soviet union , and it's unlikely they'll actually run out ."
9954,"i doubt the ammunition depot explosions are destroying that much ammo . they're probably effective mainly as logistical disruption . most of the ammo destruction would be from russia using it , and also wear and tear , ageing supplies ."
9955,now playing : you dropped a bomb on me the gap band ft . ukraine army drop bombs on em ukraine . send em to hell .
9956,if they run out of conventional ammo they will simply start using their nukes . already russian tv is preparing the population for exactly this scenario . so it may be quite a negative thing for the west
9957,this is good but don't count on russia running out of ammo anytime soon .
9958,"in additional addition , they spammed literally millions of artillery rounds already in this war because they idiotically thought it would break ukraine . probably wishing they had those rounds now ."
9959,"and this is their [ rusty stockpiles ]( that was supposed to be 2010 , so worse now"
9960,they are also prime targets for grenades dropped from small cheap drones .
9961,"the quote comes from arthur ' bomber ' harris , head of raf bomber command ."
9962,it's one thing to look at your enemy and think of countermeasures . you don't know if it'll work or if the enemy has secret weapons you couldn't account for . so yeah this is the part where western military r&d guys and strategists get their hypotheses tested and i think we're all happy they appear to have overestimated the opponent .
9963,false . harbor freight doesnt promise to be anything other than what it is . and its decent .
9964,don't be knocking harbor freight .
9965,and even when they are new they don't look like they could hit much ...
9966,"the goal is more so to stretch their supply lines to the point where their military can't operate with any sort of agility . as it says in the article , the russians now have to transport supplies more like 62 miles to the front line troops vs . more like 19 miles before . combine that with ukraine destroying over 1300 trucks that would be used for such transport and you have a real problem . so in other words , will russia continue to have stores of ammunition domestically , or far behind the front line in ukraine ? sure . but does that make up for their front-line troops being 50 + miles from badly needed supplies ? absolutely not ."
9967,if they use nukes they will get a retaliatory strike back
9968,and wasted all their precise ammo / rockets destroying cities and terrorizing civilian targets and only managed to further cement ukraine resolve to fight back .
9969,i doubt theyre running out of ammo just yet but theyve probably had to lower their rate of fire . they just cant sustain 50k-60k shells a day if the war is going to drag on for another 6 months or more .
9970,"in additive additional addition , they are allegedly no longer capable of making quality new barrels due to sanctions going back to 2014 . russia running out of artillery barrels is quite literally a possibility ."
9971,"i mean while this is affecting their supply lines , russia likely still has millions of rounds left . their problem is having to move ammo dumps further behind lines now meaning more distance to cover by truck meaning more fuel and maintenance needed ."
9972,"egad ... every crate is rotten , every shell is rusty or soaking wet for decades ... why haven't these just blown up on their own by now ? are piles of explosives in this condition generally still safe until they get fuses added ?"
9973,"ok , now \* that \* actually surprised me . i'm not sure what i was expecting to see , but this level of "" ah , just drop it anywhere you want to ivan and i do mean drop it "" disregard for any concept of safety staggers the mind . you'd think someone might want to mention to the guys handling it that this stuff is kind of explodey ."
9974,i worked in munitions storage for ten years in the air force and uh ... holy shit .
9975,it is known that they have shortages now of some types of dumb ammo as well . and it could be for reasons such as this : improper long term storage . there still shooting although at a reduced pace and i am really curious when the well is going to run truly dry . i think it is on the horizon .
9976,not if they drop them on kyiv . i might add that i am a refugee from ukraine so i hope i am wrong but russian state owned tv is presenting the kremlin's thinking and it all looks very nuclear .
9977,and motivate the civilized world to assist ukraine !
9978,"they have more but have been unwilling to commit them to this war , probably because they need them in defense of russian cities ."
9979,"agreed that they are not going to run out of dumb shells any time soon . however , ammo dumps have had to be moved farther behind the front line doubling or tripling transport times reducing the available shells at the artillery ."
9980,"forcing them to move the supply depots farther behind their lines greatly slows down their fire rate . they have the same number of supply trucks but have to drive a longer distance , meaning the trucks can make fewer complete trips in the same amount of time ."
9981,"the issue is not running out of shells per say , its running out of shells right there , next to you or close by , so that you can use it ."
9982,"the issue isn't about ammo because they have a near unlimited amount . the issue is actually getting the stuff to the front lines where their artillery needs it . having 10 million tons ( made up ) of artillery rounds is useless if you can't get it to where you need it . this is further complicated in that russian logistics isn't designed for ferry stuff long distance with trucks since they're reliant on their rail network and their current strategy is to just spam all their ammo because they have no accuracy , necessitating huge ammo dumps ."
9983,"i saw some numbers kicked around that up to 1/3 of everything russia fires duds out . no idea how accurate that is , but i see a lot of cheese in patron's future ."
9984,"they have been blowing up on their own . just search for russian ammo dump explosions on youtube . theres at least a dozen such incidents recorded every year since phones with cameras became widely available . although , some people speculate that these accidents are also used to cover up theft of equipment and fuel . but when you see how russian soldiers [ unload ammo ]("
9985,"palletized shit is hard to steal from . if you just stack it willy nilly , who says some crates cant grow legs amd end up in some backwater warlord's arsenal ."
9986,then you are going to love this ! [ unloading ammo russian army style ](
9987,"a drop on kyiv would automatically trigger article 5 due to the shit blown into neighboring nato countries . that and america wouldn't wait for a "" what's next "". it will be pre-emptive strikes and the end of the world . so , no ."
9988,"and broke an agreement on grain shipments only moments after signing it , ensuring that no future agreements of any sort will be possible even if they are in russia's interest ."
9989,yep that absolutely is a huge issue . thats also an issue in addition to the one that i mentioned . sustaining 60k shells per day without massively ramping up production is also just not feasible for a long drawn out war .
9990,bridges near kherson have been destroyed so supply routes are broken . one bridge remains but ukraine forces have put several large holes down the center of it . the bridge now is only suitable for small cars and not heavy armoured vehicles an tanks etc . options for resupplying the front lines to that area very limited . a pontoon bridge would likely be a disaster . drones an satellites will be watching that river constantly . it seems the only way across the dnipro river is across the dam . that's over 30km away from kherson and very exposed . i'm hoping ukraine can have some success and take back that area soon . russia will hopefully run out of supplies in that area .
9991,"> they have the same number of supply trucks for now . but given their maintenance skills , that extra wear will soon kick in "
9992,"in some cases tanks were driving themselves to pick up ammo because of no support trucks . already traveling close the their maximum range , doubling distance to resupply means in some of those cases the tank would have to also refuel in the middle of the trip to pick up ammo and return to the feild ."
9993,"yes logistics is a huge deal as is other issues like the barreling wearing out but thats not the issue im talking about . im talking about total shells in storage . quite simply no nation , even russia , has deep enough stockpiles for prolonged artillery warfare . this war isnt ending in a week or a month so russia has a choice . massively ramp up production and go into total war mode production or cut back on the amount of shells theyre burning through sometime in the next couple months ."
9994,"yeah , that is one of the main problems for then . this was from a nov 2021 article , pre war . >[...] if the combined arms army fired a single volley , it would require 56 to 90 trucks just to replenish rocket ammunition . that is about a half of a dry cargo truck force in the material-technical support brigade just to replace one volley of rockets . there is also between six to nine tube artillery battalions , nine air defense artillery battalions , 12 mechanized and recon battalions , three to five tank battalions , mortars , anti-tank missiles , and small arms ammunition not to mention , food , engineering , medical supplies , and so on . those requirements are harder to estimate , but the potential resupply requirements are substantial . the russian army force needs a lot of trucks just for ammunition and dry cargo replenishment ..... and the war has shown that the russian suck at logistics ."
9995,yep nothing apart from total defeat is an option now . ukraine has to beat them with a stick not a pen .
9996,they will be sold on ebay before they wear out . gotta update the dacha at st petersburg now the monaco one is off limits .
9997,stick ? a big club is better .
9998,beating them back into russia and dismantling their capacity to make war would be better . make the peace last longer .
9999,"stick's better for poking the mangy old bear in the eye , though ."
10000,"yes , but clubs do much more damage when taken to the head or body .... slava ukraini ...!!"
10001,"well , if you make it a really long and pointy stick , that might work , right ? and you can keep a bit of distance between you and the rotting bear , which , given the smell , is probably a nice thing ."
10002,"i have to say , that ursula at the end startled me a bit : d"
10003,"you've gotta admire ukraine's propaganda . they've become masters of it , and the whole world should take notes ."
10004,number 9 is best !
10005,weird the eu lady is included as a picture .
10006,"size is misleading ; russian land area is 28 times bigger , but it's population is only 3 1/2 times bigger ."
10007,ruzzia is dumb as f*ck and drunk too
10008,also 28 times more retarded !!
10009,this is already a historical victory for ukraine !
10010, ! !!!!!
10011,... and 28 points lower iq matters !
10012,""" war brings out the best and worst in people ."" i think about that whenever i see firefighters/medics/random people putting their lives on the line for strangers . and when i see the horrible atrocities . slava ukraine !"
10013,did they tow a t-14 armata ?
10014,fighting for freedom is banning opposition political parties
10015,one gets the impression that a lot of the least terrible/most innovative and clever parts of the ussr may have come from having ukraine as part of it .
10016,"like russia ukraine has people and knowledge from the udssr times . also the ukraine got that other sides can check facts independently . russia is still along the line of just laying claims to contra-factual stuff "" moskva sunk by storm "", while the official statements from ukraine are pretty solid to later fact checks . of course , some facts are easier to check than others , and its a war , with a "" fog of war "", but as an observer , the communication of both sides looks massively different in the aspects of facts ."
10017,which is shocking because i thought russia was supposed to be the master of propaganda .
10018,"when the truth is on your side , you don't need "" propaganda "". memes , however are definitely epic , the world should take notice indeed . it's not often that a country without a naval presence figures out how to sink a flagman ship of the ruzzian fleet and then release a stamp commemorating the event ."
10019,its easy if you have the real facts that you can use . have a look how harder its for r*ssia to do their propaganda based on the imaginary word they created even with a network of kgb agents around the world .
10020,that's what made it sexy
10021,ikr
10022,she wants to make a good pr for herself on the ukraines expense .
10023,"how is this misleading ? quote : ' country that is 28 times * larger *' population - bigger , but land is larger . everything seems correct here edit : one could say ' country is bigger ' obviously , but i do not hear people say ' population is larger '"
10024,"yes . plus , the strategic depth of the land is much more important than ratio , as it exposed logistics and halted the advance ."
10025,also a majority of russia is barely inhabited
10026,how ? the war is still ongoing and the support they got from eu plus usa is next to legendary ... this is actually quite worrying since china has not yet taken real action in pacific .
10027,they would have had russia sent any
10028,"that applies to russia since it's existence , as well as belarus , both were born from a beginning in kiev . based on putin's belief of correcting historical territorial claims , ukraine should be claiming both russia and belarus as part of their territory ."
10029,well ukraine was pretty firmly in the 2 spot next to russia as far as size and importance of the 20 ~ republics of the soviet union . leonid brezhnev was of ukrainian descent . and some of the other soviet premiers may have had ukrainian ancestry .
10030,"only for the domestic , fetal alcohol syndrome market"
10031,more masters of disinformation that leads to confusion or apathy .
10032,all of that falls under propaganda
10033,"lmfao this dude just said "" when it's true it's not propaganda "" looks like it might be working on you lad "
10034,i think youre just used to the idea that propaganda always disinformation . thats not always true . it can be truthful statements and a force for good ; it helps with morale . and morale is probably one of the biggest factors helping ukraine right now .
10035,"i hate to say it , but the truth has to be sold , just like everything else these days , or it loses . the bad guys are great at generating really enticing lies ."
10036,thats not the case
10037,"correct but misleading , the size of the country isn't really relevant . you wouldn't be surprised to see the uk beating mongolia ."
10038,> i do not hear people say ' population is larger ' this is 100 % valid english and used regularly .
10039,i think he means for practical purposes when comparing countries pops is better . i would say pop/economy is best .
10040,sure it's technically correct but you obviously know it's misleading . the physical size of the country isn't as important as the amount of people the country has . it would be one thing if ukraine was invading russia and had to cross all that territory but it's the opposite that is true . in terms that actually matter russia isn't 28 times the size of ukraine . it is however still a david and goliath situation .
10041,are you disingenuous or you didn't understand what this guy said ?
10042,"there is a mentionworty sideaspect when it comes to size and population : russia needs troops at their long borders and troops in their major cities and areas , to quell unrest . that was always a given in russias military planning and chunks down on the available material and troops in a extreme way . the stuff is already needed elsewhere . they can not leave borders unguarded , nor can they use their globally active navy besides what is already in the black sea . that explains partially , that with even nearly 3 times the size in population , they can not muster easily the same voluntary troop numbers . russia runs into a problem of their own propaganda at that point . they claimed that the invasion was a sort of "" police action "", not a war . their constitution demands that they have to be at war to go full draft . so besides the economic effects , civil unrest consequences would come to bite russia once russia/kreml changed definitions in that regard . i doubt that china would be supporting russia when it went that way and the best troops russia had for internal suppression were materially annihilated when they tried landing via airlift in ukraine at the begin of the war ."
10043,"china likes it's international business more than risking it for supporting an insane man that plays non-sense war-games . maybe china will start a war for itself , some day .. - but not now ."
10044,huh ? china ? what are you talking about ?
10045,"a historical victory .. because of its ability to hold their ground against a huge , big fucked-up enemy .. - it's a victory in itself . (* if it not a perverted game to play weak by russia , for some reason , of course .)"
10046,"china has no reason to move . ( with what on what ?) they earn from russia isloation , they can dictate prizes without sending weapons . china is draining russia right now for what it can get , maybe later some territories if the russian federation is strained enough . otherwise this war is just a business opportunity for china , but no commitment . for example abc weapon usage by russia would be a no go for china and a reason to interviene against russia , because they know russia would also use it against them eventually . those states ( china , russia ) are coexistent , not cooperating nato or eu ."
10047,"yeah , sure . but did they ?"
10048,so sort of a scotland to england in the uk/british empire ?
10049,have any statistic to back that up ? because russians drink less than brits during pregnancy these days .
10050,"yes , but this one is very well done , without the heavy tone you usually get . it is effective propaganda , it doesnt have the crassness of russian efforts ."
10051,"not really . propaganda has a pretty clear definition . > information , especially of a biased or misleading nature , used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view . there's nothing biased nor misleading about the sinking of moskva or farmers "" repossessing "" tanks ."
10052,"yes it is . she is failed politician , dishonest , manipulative ."
10053,idk i'd be pretty surprised that the uk somehow got troops through russia and/or china .
10054,like when talking about obesity ?
10055,i've been corrected and i think you are actually correct .
10056,we'll see how it goes . they are preparing for special operations in taiwan for the past years ... ignoring their behaviour is going to cause the next ukraine crisis ... with cpus instead of corn .
10057,are you ignorant or disingenuous ?
10058,"victory should be celebrated when you win the war , not a battle ... if you celebrate for battles , you are preparing for a lose scenario with propaganda ."
10059,that sounds about right . ( although it's hard to compare a country of 4 primary divisions to one with 20 ~)
10060,"anything used to promote a political cause or point of view is propaganda . many people associate it automatically with negative or manipulative statements but that isnt always the case . something as simple as war bonds for victory can be considered propaganda , and you could hardly call encouraging people buying war bonds to be a biased or manipulative thing ."
10061,""" especially "" but not necessarily . most propaganda has at least * some * truth to it . 4s is saying that this is propaganda doesn't mean that he's saying it's bad"
10062,"a simple bumper sticker saying support our troops is propaganda . having a military recruiter come tell his story at a high school os propaganda . slogans like loose lips sink ships are propaganda . none of those things are wrong or untruthful in any way , but that doesn't mean they aren't explicitly done for the purposes of furthering a national interest , which is all something needs to be propaganda ."
10063,"showing me a copy-paste of a google definition of propaganda , does not invalidate what i've said . this is pure propaganda , and the thing itself doesn't have to be misleading or false . ukrainians giving russian pows an opportunity to phone home is another example of ukraine's superb propaganda ."
10064,"sowhat you are saying is , that she created this about herself and included it in this reddit post ? hats off ! especially since granny here looks like her first text message was a wax stamped letter"
10065,"the number of "" flintenuschi "" bootlickers here is disturbing . imagine protecting a criminal ."
10066,"she was one of the first to visit bucha , and the eu kicked into gear after that . there is more they could have done but they don't have unlimited power . she might be a typical politician , but she is on the right side ."
10067,no that was boris johnson .
10068,one of her failures . the equipment levels of the german bundeswehr .
10069,"lol , if these are the results of dishonesty , failure and manipulation , i would welcome more of it ."
10070,"you can definitely say that a country has a larger population than another without meaning obesity . from now on , though , i will assume obesity every time . did you know that china has the worlds largest population ? yep , super fat , each one ."
10071,of course ..
10072,"it's you who is incoherent . i assume you are , in some way , trying to talk about taiwan ?"
10073,"when you fight a bigger enemy and get him to bleed .. you may lose the war , eventually .. but got the win in terms of bravery , endurance and honor . - meanwhile the big guy can't celebrate his pathetic struggle against a much smaller opponent .."
10074,"putting "" smoking kills "" on a pack of smokes ( almost used the british colloquialism there before i remembered about american readers ) is propaganda for that matter ."
10075,"people associate the term "" propaganda "" with fascist ideology and the big bad evil guy by nature . it is propaganda , and they fully know it , but they dont want to call it like that . let them ."
10076,"its not about that . i for one , know that she failed upwards . nonetheless she is doing the right thing for once ."
10077,"she has been advocating for a stronger bundeswehr her whole career , but she cant increase budgets or pay for equipment all on her own . she wants a more assertive germany , with arming levels to match , and eventually an eu army ."
10078,"i am very coherent . you just need to be spoonfed words . no , i was talking about talibanska ..... man if you need to ask stupid questions , i don't know what to tell you ..."
10079,"we can call it "" advertising "" then , to prevent people's feelings from getting hurt ."
10080,"yea she also spend millions of taxpayer money on consulting ( about renovating an old sailing boat ). "" spend "" might give the wrong impression . she gave it to her son who was the consultant.n"
10081,"the bundeswehr has a higher budget then that of france's military , despite the french having more active and reserve personnel , more tanks , more armored vehicles , more aircraft and helicopters , more submarines , actually having aircraft carriers and destroyers , and on top of that managing to maintain a nuclear weapons deterrence . the bundeswehr doesn't need an advocate as a minister , but somebody competent ."
10082,"german procurement is incredibly innefficient , even more so in her time as mod . the main problem with her wasnt the money , rather how she spent it ( on mckinsey where , coincidentaly her son works ...) any sane mod could use the money to more effect than her . she wasted millions on berater and essentially made the bundeswehr lose at court against hk because the g36 is a damn fine rifle . at the same time she wasted money for social benefits ... sounds nice but with a "" small budget "" you should rather spend it on proper equipment . civilians lending the bw winter cloths so that the bw can perform nato ops in the baltics and exercises in norway is the wrong thing to do . in short : flintenuschi had no idea what she was doing . akk at least looked like she tried ."
10083,"talibanska ? wtf ? am i talking to gpt-3 ? and if you're being sarcastic and you * were * talking about a hypothetical invasion of taiwan , that has nothing to do with whether ukraine is winning against russia"
10084,who cares of those people that use feelings for their judgements ?
10085,you don't know what you're talking about mate .
10086,isnt donetsk fully under russian authority ? i dont understand this one 
10087,that stuff is so sick ! who in the name drops such things on cities it supposedly controls ?
10088,dnr/lnr forces have had huge losses and are getting tired of being used as cannon fodder . so russia bombs donetsk and blames ukraine to keep them motivated and willing to fight outside of their oblasts .
10089,"i think the most likely explanation the following : as russians are already caught trying to do false flag artillery strikes here , is most likely that some drunk ass russian shoved the wrong shell up the tube , and bam ."
10090,"thermite , a mixture of metal powder and metal oxide , is the hottest burning man-made substance in the world . it burns at temperatures of more than 2,200c , enough to burn through steel or asphalt . on human flesh , it can burn down to the bone . bunch of war criminals who are completely complicate and brainwashed by an egotistical tyrant . "
10091,being rendered totally ineffective in the battlefield they have to resort to attacking themselves . they keep raising the bar on embarrassing themselves .
10092,probably some soldier piss drunk accidentally releasing it in the wrong area . its under their control . no fightjng going on there atm . no infantry .
10093,"this doesn't look like white phosphorous , it looks like magnesium thermite . either way we are witnessing a literal war crime . im fairly positive the only approved use of these munitions by the geneva convention and other agreements in combat is for the purposes of illumination , smoke screen , and disabling equipment ( ie thermite on an enemy vehicles engine block , or in the breech of an artillery or other fixed gun position .) but using it as an offensive weapon is forbidden . just setting em off like this over a city filled with civillians is barberic . im sure russia and those damn bots will come out in force saying that "" it was only for illumination ? we wouldnt * purposefully * target civillians !"" then they will just outright claim it was in fact , the ukranians attacking themselves . edit : see ? there they are .."
10094,they brag about using white phosphorus while also claiming that aren't targeting citizens . they're doing ethnic cleansing and genocide and are showing they're a generally inferior society .
10095,this doesn't make any sense . is it a false flag ?
10096,firefighters must be working overtime . but i cant deny it looks beautiful on the night sky .
10097,what the actual fuck
10098,this provocation was anticipated . mobilisation coming .
10099,theyre just throwing whatever they can through played put barrels and its landing all over the place it looks like .
10100,another war crime for the collection .
10101,war crimes ?
10102,itd be beautiful if it wasnt part of this fucked up war
10103,russia committing more false flag attacks to wild up the zombies in their population .
10104,these assholes something needs to change give them the 300km himars
10105,lets not escalate anything as the us government have said .
10106,this is absurd . we need to kill putin and end this already .
10107,is this really a russian attack on a russian held city ? does ukraine have phosphorus bombs even
10108,this is probably a false flag from russia to justify using wmd in ukraine .
10109,the juxtaposition of beauty and horror
10110,well thats fucked up
10111,"this is a ukrainian lightning signs , not a russian phosphorus/thermite bomb ...."
10112,"they just won't stop . hope you enjoy what remains of this life putin , cause your next one ain't gonna be so swell ! "
10113,terrorists are doing terrorist things
10114,russia has been indiscriminately killing civilians since the war began .
10115,"uaf posted info that it's likely something used for lighting ( idk how to translate it ), not phosphorus bombs , but it's unconfirmed so far . they did post comparison photos in their telegram channel ."
10116,"excuse me , what ? thermite ? okay , were getting close to the "" we have to do something "" line . fucking thermite ."
10117,isn't this an old video ?
10118,this is the retreat .
10119,interesting to watch russia industrialize terrorism .
10120,look like fireworks
10121,"you see that ? thats an entire city on fire . i started this war killing russians in donetsk , then luhansk , then sievierodonetsk . now im killing russians in russia . it will end . soon . but before it does a lot more people gotta die. "
10122,thats not thermite . thats white phos . dont touch it
10123,how do these work ? is it like a bomb dropped by plane and explode in air ? dot get how it rains like this
10124,super fucked up thermite burns crazy hot and burns through anything . when i served i was on m1a1/a2 abrams and we had thermite to destroy the tank if it ever got disabled . it would burn through the breech of the main gun and thats like a solid block of metal . any houses or people or really anything that stuff lands on it'll just burn straight through and keep going till it hits the ground . nasty stuff .
10125,"i read the fire and got a master class on how thermite is used to burn down cities . i guarantee they dont have fire raising experts in the job , russia is just doing a half assed job of trying to copy 10 % of what the raf did during ww2 , hoping to cause some fire and panic . doing it russian style , aka generically and with no thought involved ."
10126,could it be a missile intercept or malfunction ? i wonder if an exploding solid rocket motor might look like this .
10127,why didn't the fires in the middle of the street extinguish ? i don't think pavement is not flammable to keep it going .
10128,isn't this more likely white phosphorus ?
10129,is somebody able to geolocate the place from where it was filmed ?
10130,"thermite , hot enough to melt through most metals and in some cases can evaporate itself . shit is pretty nasty stuff almost as bad a napalm"
10131,all the ukraine reddits have such shit quality control now . blatant lies ( for karma ) do not serve ukrs cause .
10132,what's the best thing to do in this circumstance ?
10133,"when talking with russians sometimes i am really astonished , what kind of stuff they believe . democracy is nothing for russian , of course , putin tells this again and again . europe is decaying and such stuff . every russian with some money wants to see european cities . a friend from russia called her friend in germany , are you ok ? can you walk down the streets ? it must be terrible . did you hear : in kaliningrad they want a referendum . russia makes often such referendums . people there suffer under the present conditions and shopping in poland was so common . it is just not decided , do they want to get independent or get an autonomous province of poland ?"
10134,this looks more like burning magnesium than phosphorus . p burns quite yelow-ish while mg burns with blinding-white flames which we can see on the footage . conclusion : it's most likely illumination roudns .
10135,interesting to see that from close-up . how effective is it ?
10136,"it's silly to assume russia would use this kind of munition on their own city . don't blindly make propagandized assumptions - apply critical reasoning . ukraine is the side shelling donetsk , and this was probably illumination flares , not incendiary munitions meant for starting fires ."
10137,"ik that this is really , really bad . but you have to admit that it sorta looks trippy at nighttime"
10138,you really think thats what thermite bombs look like ?
10139,fucking russian savages . absolute crazy lunatics . fuck russia . slava ukraini
10140,"magnesium . i keep seeing these being called phosphorous,thermite , whatever else . it's magnesium ."
10141,"isn't termite bombing , like napalm , a war crime too ? pls correct me if i'm wrong . i mean , not that the orcs would care , but it would be another thing to the list ."
10142,pretty sure thats a war crime 
10143,"this uh doesnt look to be very effective as an incendiary weapon all things considered . also it is definitely not white phosphorus , burning white phosphorus is a viscous liquid that sputters constantly and burns with a relatively normal looking fire . this stuff is most likely some sort of magnesium or metal oxide given the white color of the light produced , and how much it sparks . edit : here is what what phosphorous incendiary weapons look like for reference . note the orange color , how much faster it descends , and the massive amounts of toxic smoke ."
10144,someone should nuc moscow
10145,this type of bomb should be outlawed . it nearly as evil as nuclear . smaller but deadly to human life 
10146,bro what ? whos behind this then ??
10147,russia has no value for human lives or infrastructure of its peaceful citizens . fuck off putin
10148,russian terrorists .
10149,putins a sore freaking loser .
10150,erdogan is a fascist dog that constantly seeks validation to remain in power . idk who the fucks thought it was a great idea to keep him in charge there but it's like letting a wolf take care of sheep .
10151,no moral standards . russians will even kill their own people and blow up or bomb appartment blocks if they think it is politically useful . primitive species .
10152,weird right ? attacking the same morons that opened the door for them in the first place .
10153,"it's easy . they do not appreciate people who live in temporarily occupied territories ( as well as the inhabitants of yakutia , for example ). this has no other reason than to blame ukraine for this ( after the bombing of odessa ). even if it doesn't work for east , it still works for russians ."
10154,"it is . the russians are trying to squeeze every last conscript they can get out of the separatist enclaves since now they're facing manpower shortages after using them as cannon fodder for five months . they hope that attacking these cities , making it look like the ukrainians are attacking them , will encourage more volunteers to fight for russia ."
10155,not sure yet . someone on combat footage said that the angle of incoming shows it came from russian direction . but i ain't got a scooby .
10156,maybe they think theyre gonna lose it soon so theyre trying to do a scorch earth and get out or something
10157,"its not russian citizens , so they dont care .. also .. they wany to destroy everything just like orcs"
10158,terrorism
10159,murderous barbarian bastards ......
10160,"yes , the russians aren't attacking themselves ."
10161,> that stuff is so sick ! its incendiary ... and not really special since im yet to see it have any effect on anything since 2014 when it was first used . > who in the name drops such things on cities it supposedly controls ? ukraine does ( munitions are coming from frontline ). at least in this case . and they dont control it .
10162,this isn't russia firing on donetsk . it's ukraine firing illumination round to let them know to stop firing incendiary munition over ukrainian cities because donetsk is in range of ukraine weapon systems .
10163,lmfaooo
10164,"and you can easily make it in your garage . or , if your high school chemistry teacher is a slightly demented ex-marine , as a last week of senior year time filler . in a coffee can . with a hypergolic igniter . on top of an engine block behind the auto shop . it went all the way through ."
10165,"*"" crematoriums use incinerators that reach temperatures ranging from 760-982c . as mentioned in previous texts , temperatures of 1100c and above are required for complete bone breakdown .""* so maybe it won't stop at the bone . i wonder why there are no acid bombs , for example using [ perhaps liquid is too heavy for use in for example an artilery shell , compared with the potential damage it could cause"
10166,"watch them scream that ukraine did it . update : uaf posted info that it's likely something used for lighting ( idk how to translate it ), not phosphorus bombs , but it's unconfirmed so far . they did post comparison photos in their telegram channel ."
10167,"it looks like a [ 122mm grad 9m22s rocket ]( with warheads that are packed with "" magnesium cups filled with a thermite-type mixture...each element having a burning time of at least 2 minutes "". pretty sure it was the [ same stuff they used against azovstal ]( edit : some [ additional info on the 9m22s ]( they will claim that they were using it for something other than starting fires in a city ."
10168,"it's not white phosphorus , it's magnesium based . this has been debunked so many times each time this is reposted ."
10169,"if donetsk is under russian control , then yes . it's just russians being russians ."
10170,"either false flag , or artillery operator with 2 days of training put the wrong coordinates ."
10171,"this might be bit crazy so bear with me here , but maybe the ukrainians aren't always sweet little angels and they did this ?"
10172,it would be prettier falling on moscow .
10173,its diversion of attention from odessa
10174,not enough smoke . white phosphorus makes a metric heck ton of smoke when it burns .
10175,no . this has been debunked every single time this has been reposted .
10176,no its not . white phosphorus particles move a way more faster and look kind of different . its either an incendiary ones or light particles .
10177,"its a rocket that disperses submunitions after certain time , like cluster munition . in this case its ukraine using it on donetsk city since the direction from where the munitions are coming from is from ukrainian frontline ."
10178,because a firework doesn't go out on a pavement until it burns out . didn't you just criticise same\_old for posting the same thing multiple times ? phillip .
10179,"this was shot at ilyich prospect , 25 in kalinin district , donetsk , according to dpr citizens in the social networks ."
10180,"how can you know its a lie ? if you have factual elements , tell us all of it , but don't just spread confusion"
10181,"> apply critical reasoning . you are on wrong forum for that . > and this was probably illumination flares , not incendiary munitions meant for starting fires . those are incendiary . here you can see the munition hit the ground and burn :"
10182,"this was donetsk , its not white phosphorus . white phosphorus gives off a lot more smoke . its likely thermite incendiary submunitions . most likely a misfire by russia , they fire them on the front lines of donetsk constantly ."
10183,well it's not ukraine shooting incendiary weapons at their own cities . russia already tried to blame today's attack on odessa harbour on ukraine and that didn't stick so i guess they raised the stakes . feel free to draw your own conclusions .
10184,the russians most likely . they intentionally shell separatist areas in order to blame ukraine .
10185,"uaf posted info that it's likely something used for lighting ( idk how to translate it ), not phosphorus bombs , but it's unconfirmed so far . they did post comparison photos in their telegram channel . notice , how the tree doesn't catch on fire when the stuff falls on it ."
10186,"a potential 3/10 , since its an illumination charge . its shot to light the surroundings . have been used around dnr since 2014 ."
10187,"not weird . desperate . erdogan is probably pissed about odessa and the russians want plausible deniability -- their story has always been that it's not them doing the evil deeds , it's the ukrainian nazis and nato warriors and also apparently mutants ... so now they can go "" see !? see !? it's clearly them !"""
10188,"i don't think ukraine even has this type of "" bomb "" i've only ever seen them used by russia ."
10189,"ruzzia is trying to mobilize dnr . they are bombing to blame ukraine . its fvcked up , because thats exactly what ruzzian propaganda has been accusing ukraine of doing for 8 years . remember malaysia flight 17 ? what about today is odesa ? ruzzian scum "
10190,lmao fr these morons ruined everyones way of living in this region by starting a war simply because their guy wasnt in charge . most of the donetsk soldiers look like theyre on the spectrum or their mothers drank while they were in the womb .
10191,"this isn't russia attacking . i dont know why people post shit without verifying what's going on . this is ukrainian illumination shell fired over donetsk why ? because it is harmless magnesium it burns out very quickly dpr has been firing actual incendiary shells over towards a nearby ukrainian held city , as a response ukraine has fired a illumination shell to show they are in range of donetsk ."
10192,us tracks launches too and will likely confirm it's direction .
10193,"> not sure yet . someone on combat footage said that the angle of incoming shows it came from russian direction . but i ain't got a scooby . they were wrong . here you can see rounds coming towards person recording : this is the building from which the round bounces off you can see river behind . it towards frontline . so unless russians moved grads to a front line and fired 180 away from ukrainian forces , it was ukrainians that shelled donetsk city ."
10194,this is a link to someone guessing what this is .
10195,"is that confirmed ? i saw some people speculating that was the case but nothing official . russia did shell donetsk a week or so ago though , so it's easy to assume it's the same again with the thread headline ."
10196,"nope , it's magnesium"
10197,> lighting ( idk how to translate it ) illumination 
10198,"can you post those photos , or a link them please ? why would one need to illuminate the sky/battlefield , of an already illuminated city ? plus , that's not how those flares / rounds behave . edit : illumination rounds are falling at a much slower pace than these ( i also don't see any hint of a parachute ), won't set things on fire , extinguish themselves quicker and don't break away in such pattern . the russians have g2g and a2g rockets / missiles capable to store incendiary sub munitions , filled with an highly flammable material . what i can't tell for sure is what's the nature of that material , since the true colors are being altered by : the phone that was recorded - n times the original video has been encoded and decoded - our displays not being professionally calibrated . the thing could be phosphorous , but the initial moment the payload was unloaded is missing , so i can't tell if the reaction was spontaneous the moment it came in contact with oxygen . if it's thermite out of an g2g rocket , then tomorrow will most certainly see other videos/photos of melted small magnesium cases , along with puddles of melted iron covered by aluminum oxide ."
10199,i'm not sure something created for the purpose of illuminating an area should also hit the ground and become a flaming mass . two clear locations in the video where this stuff landed on a street ( 35 seconds in ) shows it still burning with large flames . on pavement .
10200,you can't fact check something that's impossible to confirm .
10201,they are never ex marines
10202,"this stuff is dangerous in the obvious way and also in some less obvious ways . some years ago , local tech university students watched breaking bad and thought , hey , we can do that . which they did because it's not exactly hard but they didn't think it all the way through . the thermite burned through the container , and whatever they were trying to burn through , and then landed on the ground below which had some puddles from a rain a day before . puddle became steam , explosively so , and propelled the thermite up and all around along with a lot of scaling hot steam ."
10203,yea i think its mainly because fragmentation and he are already very good at killing + theyre cheap . plus imagine some guy fumbling the round and spilling acid everywhere .
10204,"there's mortar launched flares but they look like single balls of light , not like this ."
10205,"nah these are magnesium rounds , i saw rhem use it on azovstal too"
10206,"well , apparently this was also in the neighborhood where denis pushilin lives ."
10207,"fucking barberians .. no .. thats an insult to barbarians , even they had a few drops of mercy and humanity ? this is just evil and cruel ."
10208,"not to mention the range is far less then nearest frontline , so not hard to do the math that russian terrorists are behind it , as always ."
10209,thermite . which burns more than double the temps of wp . how is that any better ?
10210,orcs drink & destroy
10211,"the geneva convention allows the use of white phosphorus as a lighting material but on a very limited basis and only in military areas . here we have residential blocks . it is worth mentioning that white phosphorus burns at 1,600 degrees celsius , cannot be extinguished with water , and gives off fumes that suffocate living organisms ."
10212,thermite
10213,"no , that would still be a war crime . let's not fall to their level"
10214,"again , it lands on the street in the distance and commences to spew out large flames , while sitting on pavement . i don't believe this is intended for illumination unless the goal is to illuminate everything by setting it all on fire ."
10215,termite ? as in wood-devouring insects ?
10216,it's white phosphorus ... vet .
10217,"i picked up the word "" fosfor "". not claiming it is phosphorus , just what i heard the guy say ."
10218,thank you i think i might have located the building . [ building in the middle is in the shot the l shaped one is from where it was filmed .]( what do you guys think does the dispersion pattern give away from what general direction the shell came in ?
10219,> uaf what is their telegram channel ?
10220,"like it would fucking work , erdogon's a shitty fascist but he's not an idiot ."
10221,trying to create a false flag by using weapons only russia has ?
10222,"according to my mother it's always ukrainians shelling their own cities , not allowing civilians escape and staging terror attacks to make russia look bad and get more support .... this is their propaganda narrative they are going with from the start ..."
10223,this
10224,"> i don't think ukraine even has this type of "" bomb "" i've only ever seen them used by russia . ukraine has been using them since 2014/5 , so they do have them ."
10225,"side note - people on the spectrum , especially people with aspergers have above average intelligence and are very sensitive , caring but overwhelmed people . they believe in justice , fairness and are truth seekers . just not part of the mainstream herd mentality . they are often ostracised and abused/bullied for their differences , yet often the ones that randomly stand up and help save others due to their quick learning abilities , in depth knowledge in a diverse range of areas and persistence in the face of constant adversity and shunning from society . also tend to thrive during disasters and emergencies when neurotypicals shut down or lose their shite . same with other neurodivergent people like those with adhd . neurodivergents are generational rebels and ahead of their time , while also remembering the wisdom of the ancients . often involved in advancing science , medicine , history , nature/animal related careers/activism for the vulnerable . i know plenty . they'd be the first pick for my team . ( see * intense world theory * and * double empathy * if you are interested in being more knowledgeable on this topic , sincerely ). they are the antithesis of putin and his little sukas ."
10226,you cant spell donetsk russian without d-r-u-n-k
10227,found the russian troll ! this is a fun game :)
10228,"thats not air defence , thats a phosphorus munition that blows up in the sky and rains fire destroying everything it touches . russia has bombed their own territories countless times to blame ukraine in order to rile up their own people . notice how they didnt throw a traditional bomb , but something a little bit less aggressive . we havent seen ukraine use these munitions even once so far , im not even sure they have them ."
10229,"that's what illumination round is , magnesium ."
10230,that's the word ! thank you !
10231,"this video looks very much like one that was posted a couple of months ago where it was russia launching incendiary munitions at ukrainian villages . at the time , the speculation was that it was white phosphorus , but i don't think that was ever confirmed ."
10232,this is magnesium illumination round fired by ukraine over donetsk as a notification to let them know that they are in range of their artillery . because donetsk forces have been firing actual incendiary munitions into ukraine held cities .
10233,"it's clearly not burning righ in front of the camera , where it landed on a tree"
10234,you are correct about that .
10235,"ouch ! i had a retroactive shudder years later when i discovered that some engine blocks are made of aluminum and magnesium . ours was just an old , rusty iron block . but i dont know that he actually checked . as it was it smoked a lot , as did the dirt it was sitting on , but it didnt catch fire ."
10236,and they work much better . even a single hand-launched illumination flare is daylight-level while it lasts .
10237,uaf telegram channel
10238,"it's not about better or worse , it's about being factual and combating misinformation ."
10239,"this doesn't look like wp . magnesium maybe . as for the geneva protocols , the russians ignore them . so that's unfortunately not relevant regardless of what material this is burning ."
10240,"this does not look like wp , wp is often used as smoke covering because it produces insane amount of smoke . its also not shot in this way , but in a fast straight motion to the ground . this looks like magnesium"
10241,definitely magnesium or a rust reduction reaction ( thermite ).
10242,"again , it lands on a tree in blear view of a camera , and it's not burning ."
10243,"you're drawing conclusions and spreading those conclusions to others without knowing what you're talking about .. veterinarian . * there's great footage on yt from syria showing the use of phosphorus munitions . what's being used here is burning very fast and is not producing smoke , some of it has already burned up before it hits the ground . when it hits stuff , like the ground and the tree it looks like most of it goes out directly . russian propaganda channel on telegram "" intel slava z "" are blaming this on ukraine and even they are saying that this isnt phosphorus munition . instead of using some stupid ethos argumentative statement by stating you're a veteran you should instead explain why you're drawing the conlucion that you did ."
10244,"doesn't wp generate so much smoke , it's used as a smokescreen too ?"
10245,other angle . you can see the momentum of munitions coming towards camera and river in background . its coming from frontline .
10246,"tried to post it twice , reddit removes it , so ... delete the spaces in this : https : // t . me / operativnozsu"
10247,"on a direct contact ? sure . so do the fireworks kids buy in stores . but these chandeliers as locals call them , are shot really high up above the buildings and burn out/dissipate before they reach 3rd floor , as long as you have your windows closed - you will be safe ."
10248,"i know - see how lapdog putler was left waiting for him , victim of an easy powermove"
10249,he is a bit of an idiot when it comes to monetary policy
10250,yup . isn't it funny they managed not to do that for 200 years and only started doing it when russian artillery is in range ?
10251,im sorry to hear that must be sad and hard dealing with such delusions and ignorance . youve probably tried but its worth sitting her down and trying to logically break it down and provide evidence .
10252,your mum is a retard
10253,and where's the source for that story you read ? ukraine doesn't even have any proper warships other than some coastal defence .
10254,go away russian troll
10255,and they cant spell donetsk russian 
10256,i am saying what wad up vote in this sub by a guy saying fact check . any link to officials confirming on what actually it was ? why would they bomb city that they control over 8 years ? it makes no sense .
10257,"where you get all this ? in post before people clearly came to conclusion that phosphorus would produce more yellow color , and the title even says thermite ."
10258,""" designed to create large fires in areas of vegetation and other flammable material , these incendiary elements are hexagonal prism shells made of * magnesium * alloy ml-5 , and are filled with a pyrotechnic composition """
10259, ! stay strong my friend 
10260,pretty sure it was ruled not to be white phosphorus but some aluminium based instead .
10261,"yep , over here and in syria they've used thermite on populated areas , either to scorch the earth ( burning flora and crops , killing people , forcing people out of their hiding spots ) or to lower the morale . but , there could be many similar reasons : the same thing can be seen when a fighter jet does a low fly-by and those could be its flares that have yet to be depleted , or you know could still be used for "" illuminating the battlefield ""."
10262,"that's the one i was describing , but they're also using the 3-2.5 ( m / cm ), and a few that r.n . , i can't name them from the top of my head . it can be , but if the uaf , has an official telegram account and said there's nothing to worry about , and gave some proof ... and will shall leave it at that ."
10263,"if i saw that , i would be worried ... and at the same time , not , like a moth . correlate my last sentence with another comment of mine when i'm describing flying jets , and what they are using , and the purpose of the things they are using , because it's of a similar nature and you'll understand why these were truly used . i initially was stupid enough to say the quiet part loud , and edited the post you've replied , and excluded any reference to ukraine entirely ( had a hunch ), on purpose ."
10264,"you mean fell between the branches of the tree down to the ground just before the camera moved to focus on a different direction , or do you think those two fires in the street , one of which the camera zoomed on , were just coincidentally there , burning ?"
10265,"again , it falls between the branches of the tree and the camera moves away before you can see where it lands beneath the tree , and then the camera zooms in on a couple of fires in the middle of the street . you not going to address the fire in the street at all ?"
10266,you mean coming towards the camera in the second shot ? then it would have been fired from east since the camera faces this direction . the dispersion is generaly going sout i guess due to the wind .
10267,thats offensive to people with an intellectual disability . dont compare them with someone who believes in that stupid ruzzian propaganda .
10268,"vodka supply ran out last year , and even the industrial cleaner bottle is already empty . such is life in the dnr ."
10269,can i ask what your native language is ? may i also ask what sources you heard ?
10270,"thermite is a reddish in colour , you can look up videos of thermite being used in mariupol . but i think youre missing the point . its not really about whether its thermite , white phosphorus or magnesium , the point stands regardless of the specific compound used ."
10271,"the worry i see is that it can start fires , destroy vehicles and damages buildings , in this case civilian ones . it makes life harder for civilians , but id say its unlikely to lead to direct deaths ."
10272,just before it extinguished .
10273,stop downvoting just because you're wrong . this isn't white phosphorus .
10274,"again , it extinguished before the camera moved"
10275,> you mean coming towards the camera in the second shot ? main video which is geolocated to the building you found . direction of the munition movement is from river towards building or even slightly towards left . that would mean it was fired from direction of west-north/west .
10276,kind of apt that dnr also stands for do not resuscitate
10277,"post that was posted yesterday , fuck now i will need to go and find it just to prove you ."
10278,i just want anyone except random redditor to confirm what i see here . is it too much to ask ?
10279,"i'm not downvoting anyone . i'm the one being down voted because i'm pointing out that whatever this is continues to burn in multiple locations on a street at 35 seconds into the video . i also never made any claims as to what it is , so i'm not sure why you're telling me this isn't "" white phosphorus ""."
10280,"again , you don't seem to have much to say about the fires in the middle of the street that aren't extinguished , and last i checked , pavement doesn't make for good kindling ."
10281,not sure about this because both videos start pretty late . if it was windy on this night the general direction would approx . be south south east .
10282,answer my other question . ill be waiting . glory to ukraine glory to the heroes
10283,"umm welcome to reddit , where everyones a random redditor ? you want a munitions expert to give you a breakdown ? you replied to a comment thats not really about specific compounds or munitions used demanding specific when thats not the point of discussion . weve seen incendiary shells used by russia dozens of times , its not new . most here are familiar with it , russia used them to set crops on fire regularly . thermite , white phosphorus , magnesium thats all you really need to know . theres a chance it could be an illumination shell as well ."
10284,"its this : both sides have been using it , ukraine since 2014/5 ."
10285,"i understand what you mean and thoughr exactly the same , those two can't think in facts ."
10286,"the thing fell down , it's not done being a light source . it's not burning the pavement ."
10287,and you don't have anything to say about the tree .
10288,"while video does start late , the overall momentum of submunitions is still visible , especially at start . there is no visible wind since trails are pretty stationary ."
10289,"i am ukrainian , born in horlovka , now citizen of lithuania . by replying like that you make fool of yourself ."
10290,"look , all information that i have is that something white and burning falling from the skies . observer in video assumes that it was hit by air defense . and yes russians are at fault here , duh ... as they are agressors . as no one provides any more specifics , that interest me , there is no need to talk about it anymore ."
10291,"what exactly are you seeing at 35 seconds into the video ? because i'm seeing two locations where this stuff is landed and continues to burn . if that landed on a rooftop or anything else that would burn , i imagine it would be an issue . you keep saying that this extinguishes when it hits a tree , i don't see any evidence of that , it looks like it just falls between the branches of the tree but i still see light beneath the tree which makes me think it's still burning down there . just because the camera didn't pan down to confirm that doesn't mean anything and the fact that there's still fires in the street around 35 seconds in tells me that this stuff isn't extinguishing the moment it hits the ground or before it hits the ground ."
10292,"agree with same\_old . it clearly falls into leaves and a tree and does not cause it to catch fire . it falls on the pavement but does not set anything alight . of course it carries on burning for a bit , so will a firework if you hold it in your hand until it burns out . phillip ."
10293,"here's what i'll say . if this stuff is capable of maintaining a large fire in the middle of the road , that is to say it reached the ground and continued to burn , then i would say it's just as possible that it has reached rooftops and other flammable surfaces and also continued to burn . if that's what you consider to be something that was created just to illuminate an area , it's a pretty piss poor design and a fire hazard at best ."
10294,go find the post buddy . we are all waiting
10295,"agree with whoever you like , although i've also seen fireworks continue burning after hitting the ground , if you look at the distance of those fires from the person filming , and consider just how large they would need to be to show up as big as they do in the video , they are definitely large enough to easily set a rooftop on fire . personally , i have a hard time accepting the assessment of someone who has been spam posting the exact same message repeatedly across this thread while also ignoring some contradictory details , with regard to their claims , about the video itself . i've seen russian troll accounts do the exact same thing to try and control the narrative or derail conversations . that being said , i'm sure we'll find out more when an official message from the ukrainian authorities comes out ."
10296,"yes , but aren't trees flammable ? i mean , last you checked ..."
10297,"moldova has taken in a lot of refugees from ukraine . more than slovakia , hungary , and belarus . giving the state of affairs in those countries ; id flee to poland too . which has taken the most refugees . and yes , they should be very worried about russian aggression"

10301,"this makes me so furious . no one , no one should have to be afraid of invasion , rape , and murder because of some insecure fuckhead thinks he should rule europe ."
10302,"moldova should declare war to romania and then get "" occupied "" by romania , problem solved"
10303,"russia can't get to moldova . it's on the other side of ukraine and they're not making any progress in the south . there are some russian soldiers in transnistria , but were they to invade moldova , either ukraine or romania could easily handle them and russia would lose any advantage their presence in transnistria gives them immediately ."
10304,"moldova should be worried , but what have they been doing to prevent or prepare for that possibility ? their military is widely acknowledged to be ill-equiped , to put it politely ."
10305,"any country part of nato is safe unless putin is totally insane . nato counties could easily defeat russia . * if a country can start an annexation war without any regard for international law , then in this sense , nobody is safe, she said . i think a lot of countries are worried. *"
10306,"from what i understand , which is admittedly very little , moldova is very rural and undeveloped . in their shoes i would be fearful of russia too , as they have no defenses and the world would not come to their aid . on the other hand , russia also has no reason to invade them as there would be no spoils . still , just to be safe , if it were me i would do everything in my power to get as close to europe as quickly as possible ."
10307,"i really think moldova needs to take a short circuit trip back to reunification with romania , come to some federal agreement but fall under romania again and they'll have far less to be concerned with ."
10308,"for those curious about moldova joining nato , moldova is in an individual partnership action plan country with nato . however , moldova is bound by article 11 of its constitution which states : "" the republic of moldova proclaims its permanent neutrality . the republic of moldova does not allow the deployment of armed forces of other states on its territory ."""
10309,time for moldova to reunite with romania . get that eu and nato benefits
10310,"the drive from odesa the port city we been reading about in the news lately ( rocket bombardment ) to teraspol a city in russia contested territory is less than 2 hours . the article makes it sound like it's a theoretical threat . the danger of war spilling into moldova is very , very real ."
10311,taiwan and hong kong should be worried now that there is precedent .
10312,heres an important point for everyone in the thread . russia may not have the capability to effectively invade moldova but that doesnt mean that putin knows it .
10313,christ i have a friend in moldova . ive been worried sick for a while
10314,"hell , i'm worried about the russian invasion and i live in australia . i really don't want this war to accelerate"
10315,i can't wait for all the nuanced commentary from all those who can't even find moldova on a map .
10316,"maybe this is an impossible idea , and if it is please someone explain why , but why can't moldova seek out a temporary defensive agreement with another state on its own ? for instance , what is to stop it from contacting france or the uk and offering them a 5 year lease on a military base on their territory so long as that country also agrees to keep a certain amount of troops at the ready in moldova to help ward off a possible russian invasion ? and it doesn't have to be those particular countries , or that exact set of terms , but isn't it possible to make some kind of unilateral defensive agreement with a militarily stronger country ?"
10317,"they know that the moment ukraine falls , they will be the next target ."
10318,jfc no one has ever been safe . the last 50years + hasnt been some make-work project . the fact any country does any business with russia or china is straight stupidity . are we having fun playing his game ???
10319,"567 comments in this thread so far and i doubt even 500 of them know fuck all about moldova . like why comment on shit you know nothing about , stfu and let people who know what they're talking about contribute ."
10320,yeah theyre basically fucked if odessa falls
10321,romania should annex moldova which was part of it long time ago . this way they get the security they need .
10322,this is why we cannot let russia win a single inch this time around . they have learned that they can repeat their aggressions without being held accountable . this time we need to break that idea . otherwise russia will annex countries every 4-6 years and it will never stop .
10323,i'd also be worried if i didn't have nukes .
10324,"while yes , nato will come to moldova's rescue in the event of a russian invasion , the russians will be well into the country doing terrible damage to it until nato works its way to helping moldova . i think that's moldova's fear . the russians can wreck a lot of crap in a small amount of time for moldova"
10325,can't they just invite the us to have a base there in exchange for protection ? i get the impression this arrangement happens a lot
10326,"armchair general opinion here : at this point if nato collectively rolled slowly into ukraine and held the rear while ukrainians lead and retake territory there's nothing putin could do about it right now . if they did it before putin can restock , taking a minimally offensive stance as possible , by acting as the rear guard , and relying on intimidation through large numbers , they could ; 1 . cause a mass route in russian conscripts . 2 . show up putin by calling his nuclear bluff and destroy his strongman image for good . 3 . train & equip ukrainians with nato gear much faster . 4 . gain a greatful ally in ukraine and establish access to the black sea . 5 . rebuild ukraine faster and even elevate it's standard of living to levels above pre-invastion as a huge cultural values victory showing what democratic countries can achieve when united ."
10327,"romania wouldn't let it happen . with or without nato , it wouldn't let moldova fall and that's not even mentioning that ukraine would 100 % intervene as well in such a scenario . transnistria would fall so quick and that's why russia hasn't made a move on moldova as of yet and wouldn't as long as odessa continues to stand ."
10328,"europe dosent give a shit about moldova , we are the poorest county of the continent , instead of sending us money to help the refuges they send weapons non stop to ukraine , our economy is already broken , but nobody in the world gives a fuck about us as always , and we must help them whit our resources , fuck europe , fuck russia and fuck zelenski they all play with poor people lives"
10329,"okay i need to ask whats up with all these articles from western media saying that putins army is a sham and crumbling and thats why hes resorting to shelling and bombing civilian areas ( obviously the entire country is a civilian area ), then articles saying every western or non aligned country near russia is afraid of an invasion and americans need to take it seriously . which is it ? is putins army actually weak and hes virtually leading the entire conflict from his bedroom . or is it actually way more equipped and funded enough to actually invade all or half of western/non aligned nations ? then theres the whole russia wants alaska back thing i saw an article on and cant tell if thats a meme or not ."
10330,ukraine offered to take out the trash....they should take them up on it .
10331,"russia cant handle the mess they made in ukraine , theyre not adding to the embarrassment ."
10332,"moldova should send troops to help ukraine and also transnistria . if odessa and budjak fall , its not a matter of if , but when russia will invade moldova . ."
10333,this confuses me . how is it that the narrative is that russia is losing the war and in the same breath moments away from invading other nations ?
10334,"actually , i'd say everyone is safer now that we know russia has an absolute dog shit military that can't make it half way down the road without breaking down or running out of gas . i don't think russia would even rate in the world's top 10 anymore , maybe even top 20 ."
10335,why would moldova be worried when ukraine is going to win anyway .
10336,it's time for request ukrainian peacekeepers to restore authority on soverign moldovan land .
10337,"all of russia is responsible , even its own citizens who are doing nothing to topple their cancer-stricken loser leader ."
10338,never going to be a better time to cure yourself of that problem by cooperating with ukraine to evict all the russian army units from transnistria .
10339,"i think now is the time moldova politely asks the russian military to leave her country . and if they will not , they should get treated like any other invasionary force....moldova should ask for help from anyone willing to do so to remove them"
10340,"they know they are next on putrids list . its why the world has to help ukraine stop these monsters * now * before they get any further , because every step they take moves us closer to the brink . i dont particularly want to be forced to learn russian at my age , do you ?"
10341,"moldova was ruled by the russian empire and the soviet union for hundreds of years , but was not completely assimilated into russia . it seems that the russian empire's ability to assimilate was low ."
10342,they should attack russia preemptively to show them who's boss . the russian army is at their weakest now .
10343,"there is no reason for moldova to exist as a separate state from romania . if they're so scared , they should immediately call for a unification process and automatically become part of nato and the eu ."
10344,does moldova have nukes ?
10345,"who said they stop at ukraine ? anyone ? he's trying to reunite the ussr . he can't use "" denazification "" excuseson two countries !"
10346,literally everyone who voted in the pro-european president is regretting their decision . the words of the administration do not reflect what the country feels .
10347,"i know this is nit popular in reddit . but if there is a gd , and he is accepting prayers maybe we should throw some his way . because i want want my children to grow up in a world that is better than mine . not worse . and it seems to be getting worse everyday . and it seems like humanity can't get a grip on itself ."
10348,has zlad ! made any statements ?
10349,this article has a number of problems describing geography .
10350,this is such a sad situation .
10351,the question should be why wouldn't you be worried about russian aggression
10352,who tf would go to belarus when fleeing ?
10353,what state of affairs in slovakia ? enlighten me please
10354,"i seriously doubt russia would go after anyone else right now , putting my bare bones basic understanding of tactics into play i think it would be beyond disastrous if putin decided to fight a two front war . the basic understanding i have of this comes down to one word , logistics . putin already proved he hadnt properly planned the logistics for a possible prolonged battle with ukraine and it would be nearly impossible for him to drum up the necessary supplies to fight another country while still engaged with ukraine . since ukraine is refusing to back down until all of its territory is returned all of the russian army is focused there , diverting troupes to start another war would be idiotic as it would immensely weaken the current lines of battle . putin is very aware of this and knows he cant do anything except bluster like a peacock . his only viable option would be to launch nukes but many countries have already stated that if russia launches nukes they would ensure mutual destruction . given all this , putin has nothing but words , hes a international joke and as long as he is fighting ukraine , a non issue ."
10355,"they should be thanking ukraine that they weren't already invaded ... if russia rolled through ukraine like they planned , they would already be sitting in moldova , and who knows where else since moldova doesn't have a military ."
10356,if i were gay or trans id probably just keep walking
10357,i mean ... that and the whole transnistria thing . and i'd head straight to romania if i were moldovan . like 40 % of them want to unify anyways .
10358,why is slovakia worse for refugees than moldova and poland ?
10359,wow
10360,don't worry russia is not going to invade those countries . russia isn't imperialist only usa is they should be fearing the usa . - sincerely american tankie
10361,the continued supply for western wepons should really help with that !
10362,"maybe it's time for moldovia and romania to do a large joint training mission with lots of romanian troops and equipment training moldavian troops and citizens interested in local defense ? / wow downvoted in one second , some group is watching this thread with interest"
10363,i think russia has to go through or around odesa to reach maldova . and that'll be an insanely costly operation for russia to do that . they can't even get mykolaiv .
10364,"ukraine would never allow that to happen . transnistria only has a couple of thousand troops . ukraine has plans to deal with that as having a totally russian controlled state on the only clean side of the country is completely unacceptable . so tranistria is relatively safe from an actual invasion - what's it's not safe from is destabilization and internal terrorist acts , ala putin's apartment bombings ."
10365,they should start rapidly expanding their army
10366,russia can bomb it .
10367,unless they use their tactical nukes . technically .. no one is safe .
10368,what advances in the south ?
10369,you all put too much weight on these awards . i used to just give them to the first post i saw .
10370,you mean this ?
10371,it's why finland never gave up conscription and bought up all the tanks denmark had .
10372,"right , but then you should be furious all the time . someone , somewhere is always being invaded and raped"
10373,middle-east noises intensify
10374,"my man , that was the default status quo for thousands of years throughout history ."
10375,"could russia come onto this scenario as a "" savior ""? cause if that's the case , we'd be fucked"
10376,200 iq move . maybe america should ' invade ' ukraine too
10377,"russian troops have always been in transnistria , ever since the 1990s . they help the transnistrian separatists with defense and to pressure moldova against joining nato , eu or merging with romania ."
10378,the black sea ?
10379,theyre like the poorest country in europe
10380,youre talking about the poorest country in europe . you think high-tech military hardware is free in peacetime ? thats not how that works .
10381,i think every country bordering russia is worried about being invaded . russia is like that creepy uncle who likes to touch in inappropriate places .
10382,"articles like this are pointless . there is nothing we can do about a russian invasion . this is a tiny country . you can drive from east to west im less than 3 hours . we do not have an army in reality . only on paper . a lot more worrying is the current economic status . the current government is surprisingly incompetent . they campained of being pro western , anti corruption and they boasted about how every minister is a specialist of his field . their current solution to the economic slowdown is to squeeze buisinesses and citizens for everything they got . on top of rising costs of fuel , electricity , food , they are increasing taxes , increasing fines and so on . my sister's mortgage went up by 35 % overnight . police pull people over and give fines for even the most minor things like dirty plates . and a lot more stuff like this , it would take too long to write out here . all of this in the name to bring more momey into the budget . more and more people here are becoming fed up and as a result are turning from west to east . russia won't have to invade . they just have to wait for these idiots to deliver the country right into their hands for free ."
10383,moldova and other poor european countries were probably russias next move but ukraine is showing a lot more guts than they were anticipating . i honestly believe the battle for ukraine will decide if russia decides to conquer other countries
10384,they can ask ukriane's help kicking out russia from transdniestria .
10385,"i mean , this is moldavia strongly hinting that they'd like some military aid . i get it , they aren't exactly an economic powerhouse but still , that aid is likely going to go directly to ukraine and not to them ."
10386,"moldova isn't a part of nato or the european union . in fact , russia has a puppet state known as [ transnistria ]( in eastern moldova , which they will use as justification to invade the country just as they used the donbas to invade ukraine ."
10387,i dont understand what youre saying . unless putin is gone ? so are we unsafe when someone takes putin out ? are you trying to say countries not in nato are unsafe unless hes taken out ?
10388,> russia also has no reason to invade them as there would be no spoils . i feel it's more of an ego thing . restore the map of soviet union and all that .
10389,i mean agriculture is like the main reason they want ukrainian land .
10390,"eh , they are an official eu candidate , from a diplomatic point of view they have closer relations to europe than ukraine did at the start of the war . if it would make sense military i'm sure they would get some javelins to keep the small russian force already in the country in check . obviously if russia conquered all of the south of ukraine and went into moldova with a massive force than it just wouldn't really matter ."
10391,sounds like youve moldova it
10392,because proclaiming neutrality has worked out amazingly throughout history . genius move right there .
10393,you'd think a country that is worried about russian aggression would join a pact to negate russian aggression ...
10394,"that's the thing , due to decades of russian propaganda and russians being settled into that region , many of them are brainwashed and genuinely want russian troops marching into their country , so uniting with romania is not a very realistic scenario anymore , which is exactly what the soviets wanted to avoid ever since they took bessarabia . they knew this moment would come , and they did the same shit the russians do nowadays . most/many moldovans that know their history already have romanian citizenship ."
10395,hong kong is already gone .
10396,"taiwan is still free . hong kong was taken over years ago . the protests and subsequent "" national security law "" china pushed through was the death rattle . i'm sure the chinese military is there ."
10397,"taiwan is less worried now than they have been in ages . before ukraine , they were paranoid about whether any help would come for them if china stepped up.........now they dont even question the us support ( and many more nations ) the precedent is tyrannical countries apparently arent nearly as good as they like to pretend ."
10398,"taiwan has nothing to be afraid of , chinas navy is dwarfed compared to the u.s . additionally , taiwan has been so fortified that a chinese invasion would likely fail even if the us , uk , and australia all did nothing"
10399,"its not rocket science that they dont have the capability to invade right now , you can just look at a map . unless russia takes odessa ( probably not happening in the next 6 months ) invading moldova is literally impossible for them ."
10400,"russia is already in moldova , they have military in transnistria and have for a while . if russian soldiers reach that area the entire country will probably fall within a few weeks . it's a very small country ."
10401,i think wildlife would get them before they would get close .
10402,"granted , as an american , prior to this clusterfuck of a war i could not have told you the exact proximity of moldova to ukraine . however , i would assume anyone who has the audacity to comment from this far away would be quite aware of all counties bordering ukraine . we all need to be keeping a close eye on this no matter where we live ."
10403,neutrality is enshrined in the moldovan constitution . it explicitly forbids deployment of foreign troops on its soil .
10404,why would anyone want to take that deal ?
10405,odessa will fall the same time warsaw does .
10406,why would nato come to their rescue ? they arent part of nato
10407,"so long as ukraine is around the russians can't do jack with moldova because if they do , ukraine will naturally come to aid moldova and help them neutralize the region . waging war in transnistria without a land corridor is beyond idiotic . the whole territory can be shot through with mortars ."
10408,nato wont get involved until a nato country is invaded ( almost no chance ) or the security council authorizes intervention ( no chance ).
10409,nato will come to aid moldova as same as they came to aid ukraine
10410,"nato is not involved directly in ukraine , what makes you think they would in moldova ?"
10411,russian troops are on moldovan soil and have been for a long time . a miss step would be very dangerous .
10412,nobody cares about you because your neutrality clause in your constitution and your insistence on being separate from romania even though youre the same renders you irrelevant even on regional matters .
10413,do you guys want to join romania again ?
10414,no one owes you shit 
10415,""" fuck europe "" because people in other european countries does not send you money from their own pockets ?"
10416,there is so much propaganda being release from all sides that nobody actually knows what the fuck they are talking about
10417,"the russian army may be weakened , but it's not "" can't afford to invade a small country like moldova "" weakened ."
10418,"> then articles saying every western or non aligned country near russia is afraid of an invasion read about transnistria and youll understand . moldova is worried russia will try to blitzkrieg the western half of hte country and kill everyone and then use it as a western front against ukraine . yes the russian military is severely weakened , but you have to understand how little to no defense moldova actually has against any aggression by russian soldiers in their eastern territory . does america want to be helping ukraine fight a single eastern front war....or suddenly worried about a multi-front war where god-knows-what starts getting dumped into the western half of ukraine ( in the form of missiles rockets and bombs ) all the things you said can and are true at the same time . youre trying to say "" well it has to be either/or "" no , no it doesnt . its both"
10419,this is western war rhetoric and propaganda . saying the so called enemy is doing bad things and they are easy to handle .
10420,i doubt moldovan troops can even get in ukraine . russian controls the eastern border in their country . it will be a full invasion once russian soldiers in the south of ukraine meet up with russia soldiers in moldova already
10421,"in war , the first casualty is the truth ."
10422,"the ukraine war is not ending anytime soon and by all measures has been a disaster for putin : economically,militarily and geopolitically moldova is an easy win . something putin can point to as an achievement to make this all worth it . also another opportunity to demonstrate the power and efficiency of the russian military . thats the only rationalization i can think of ."
10423,"that currently remains to be seen . russia has been obtaining land , but at a heavy cost as ukraine fights hard to hold them back . the war currently remains stalled on both sides ."
10424,"> ukraine is going to win anyway . losing 20 % of the land does not make ukraine winning , just saying ."
10425,"no thanks . transnistria exists because in 1992 ukraine allowed russian army to get there through its territory , and also sent volunteer cossacks who were raping and murdering not only moldovans , but also russians and ujrainians . so both russia and ukraine can pretty much go fuck themselves with all their peace keeping ideas , wed be better with romania . an honest opinion by a moldovan ."
10426,what are you doing against the warcrimes your country is doing ? with this logic you are responsible for all the crimes too .
10427,we are the borg . resistance is futile .
10428,"> for hundreds of years literally less than two centuries . 1812-1917 , 1940-1941 and 1944-1991 . and they tried ."
10429,thats something to talk about......maybe romania in return allows moldova's leadership to become romanian leadership for a term of time ( so there is some shared unification ).
10430,what an idiotic comment . please enlighten us why you think moldovans don't deserve the basic right of self-determination
10431,> there is no reason for moldova to exist as a separate state from romania . maybe your country has no reason to exist either .
10432,lol was this a serious question
10433,"if there is a god why would he need our prayers , surely this is something hed notice all by himself"
10434,"if there is a god then this is part of his plan , cause his a cunt . better to hail satan"
10435,"is a start , but id be concerned if i were close to the front lines"
10436,because they would be spreading themselves too thin ?
10437,"some authoritarian weirdly think that since nato is in general bad , it means that every country against it is good ."
10438,because russia seems to have badly overextended invading ukraine . and they haven't even managed that successfully .
10439,is that whataboutism ? / s
10440,the question should be why wouldn't you be worried about aggression .
10441,people with family ties .
10442,"if you live near the border of belarus , it might be the only escape option for you ."
10443,people with family in belarus ...
10444,"its probably your worst possible choice , but further away from where the fighting is is always better than not . for some im sure there was no choice . plus maybe some had a place to go there ( family/friends .)"
10445,"one country is an active war zone , the other is not . it's a bad choice , but if in the panic of fleeing war it's your only choice you'd probably take it ."
10446,you realize ukrainians have also fleed to russia right . getting the fuck out of the country thats being bombed and is an active warzone is most peoples priority .
10447,it could solve the immediate risk of not being shot at while you figure out where the fuck to try to get to next
10448,"a white nationalist conservative would , thats who in fact , [ this guy did ]( thats not a isolated incident yes , they are dumbasses ."
10449,ethnic russians who support the russian government
10450,"you kidding ? imagine yourself as a ukrainian ; your city is being bombed to shit , you live in the eastern third of the country and you have two young kids to look after . the passages to the west are blocked off . you can move to russia , belarus , or die in your ruined city . what tf do you expect them to do ?"
10451,we found the dumb comment of the day
10452,to be fair he is still a bit of an issue to ukraine
10453,being horrifically tactically unsound hasn't stopped putin from making decisions so far .
10454,well there have already been attacks in moldova in the russian breakaway region of transistria aimed at destabilising . not to mention they are pushing towards the port of odessa which almost borders moldova which the country is small . not to mention lukashenkos blunder on live tv showing invasion plan map which shows arrows pushing into moldova .
10455,"if russia was making rational decisions they wouldnt be in ukraine right now , and thats the rub . we cant rely on russia to make rational or pragmatic decisions with the best interests or even the long term survival of their country in mind . that makes them unpredictable , and being unpredictable makes them dangerous . its like a rabid dog ."
10456,isnt he already doing a two front war by docking around in syria right now too ?
10457,you're making it sound like a bitter transactional relationship but it seems like both countries have warm relations and are happy to support each other .
10458,for a second i thought ' trans ' meant transnistrian and i was very confused .
10459,or a woman
10460,yeah poland has ridiculously homophobic policies as well as being horribly anti choice . they have similar social views to russia
10461,if you were trans ukraine wouldnt allow you to leave
10462,you know that you don't have to tell anyone about your sexuality right ?
10463,cool story bro
10464,it isn't but it's much further away for a lot of ukrainians
10465,"moldova would first need to build sizeable army , train it and equip it ."
10466,not to mention the continued drain on russian supplies .
10467,"its complicated . moldovas constitution is fucking awful and its neutral status requirements are a major hurdle with being able to get much of any help , even if they were to get invaded"
10468,pro-russian trolls are still lurking . i've noticed many posts can get initial downvotes before starting to rise back up by the masses .
10469,"keep commenting with your honest opinion ... there are some people , other than trolls , that want to see it ..."
10470,that is actually an excellent idea ! somebody suggest it to ' em at once !
10471,"we're are doing that already , everything is fine here"
10472,"> / wow downvoted in one second , some group is watching this thread with interest instead of going full conspiracy mode you should know reddit uses vote fuzzing to avoid showing real numbers ."
10473,no .. its because you wrote ' moldovian ' instead of moldovan .. imagine being such a brainlet thinking russian bots would target this throwaway comment about moldova
10474,watching them fail to approach mykolaiv has been very satisfying .
10475,and that'll be an ** impossible ** operation for russia
10476,""" ukraine has plans to deal with that "" go on ..."
10477,"south has been an absolute stalemate . maybe he's talking about increased missile activity , but yea that sentence feels badly phrased ."
10478,"to be fair i was starting to have doubts for conscription and its usefulness , but then russia invaded ukraine in 2014 ."
10479,"i do not blame them . it is ridiculous europe has to rearm , but the only thing that will stop bullies is standing up to them ."
10480,still awful .
10481,with nato in moldova ? i don't think so
10482,"finally someone mentioned this . russia is already in moldova as part of a "" peacekeeping "" force . not a big enough unit to take the entire country but if russian troops in the south or ukraine get all the way to the border with moldova the small country would probably fall immediately ."
10483,moldova is landlocked .
10484,they've got an excellent saxophonist and violinist though
10485,they're exactly the poorest country in europe . a big chunk of their population are farmers . only majority-rural population in europe
10486,russia coming for that title .
10487,"> theyre like the poorest country in europe a friend from there said she's indifferent about moldova getting invaded . she said if they get invaded , then invaders would have to feed everyone there , which isnt necessarily a bad thing according to her"
10488,which makes them an invasion threat ? nobody is looking to invade haiti either .
10489,"i dont think finland is particularly worried . i believe russian troops would not make it 100 meters into finnish territory , theyd be obliterated ."
10490,"i've seen a bunch of discussion about moldova rejoining romania ( something they have hired in several times ), or at least entering into a much closer militarily/economic agreement . would be instant nato . currently opposed by a majority of moldovians but the spectre of russia has dramatically swayed public opinion before ( see finland )"
10491,"you really think the people look at transnistria and in a few years will decide its better to be like that ? the whole world is undergoing economic crisis right now and the people's response is to choose to go to russian side and vote out the first real non russia influenced govt they have had , then there is not much hope for moldova ."
10492,how fuel and overall price rising is current government fail ? are not this prices skyrocketing in all other countries ?
10493,"my friend , i believe similar things happen in all of europe right now . if you know romanian read europalibera or g4media to see what happens in romania , we would love to have a leader like maia sandu . life got hard for most people , but you should be more concerned of turning back to a pro-russia leadership , cause life can get much harder . if people stop voting pro-eu for cheap gas you will become another belarus and this time russia will not relax its grip ."
10494,would break their current constitution
10495,ukraine is too busy right now trying to survive
10496,moldova is genuinely the country the most at risk of being invaded by russia if putin's adventures in ukraine succeed . they're absolutely right to be scared .
10497,"transnistria exists also thanks to ukraine , which in 1992 not only allowed passing of russian troops trough its territory to attack moldova , but also encouraged it , sent volunteers ( cossacks ), who raped , murdered and tortured anyone they encountered , regardless the language or nationality , so yeah ."
10498,"i think most people are under the impression that putin is a singular dictator like stalin . imo , it takes a few chefs to run a big restaurantand as weve learned from the drug war , cutting the head off the snake often makes a hydra ."
10499,i feel at this stage even if putin is gone there's a good chance he's replaced by someone also bad . the only hope is that it's not someone bad of the warmongering variety .
10500,"figure of speech , slang .... i switched it to insane ."
10501,they also don't want ukraine to have access to vast natural gas supplies on the black sea .
10502,they dont want ukraine to undercut their natural gas to europe .
10503,"not really , russia is focused mainly on the lands close nstural gas resources and mining industry ."
10504,they have border disputes which disqualifies them from joining the eu unfortunately
10505,"things are rarely as easy as they might appear to you and moldova has problem with transnistria , mr smartass redditor"
10506,"well , you either do something about it or....just silently wait for the inevitable . at this point they are at risk of being invaded aswell and get destroyed ."
10507,drop bears are real killers
10508,like what ? kangaroos who are too lazy to even approach someone ? spiders which mostly mind their own bhsiness ? don't make me laugh
10509,too bad the russians in transnistria didn't get the memo
10510,they might be thinking of romania ?
10511,is ukraine part of nato ? nato countries are pouring billions into that conflict to keep ukraine from putin . i suspect moldova would receive the same aide . nato has to show solidarity against putin invading sovereign countries unprovoked . who else is going to stand up to him if nato doesnt ?
10512,"yep , if transnistria suddenly becomes an active warzone , it's instantly encircled by ukrainian and moldovan forces with no supply routes . congratulations , you've just delivered thousands of pows to the enemy , and freed up all the ukrainian forces currently guarding that border to be relocated to other front lines ."
10513,"good point . as long as ukraine holds back russia , moldova is safe ."
10514,"a lot of our population wants to be part of romania again , the problem are the russian ukrainian and turk presence in our country that doesn't allow us to reunite especially russians who use our country as a puppet"
10515,it's not an easy win because you can't get to it without first steamrolling over the rest of ukraine - something russia isn't well positioned to do .
10516,moldova isn't an easy win if either of their neighbors intercede on moldova's behalf .
10517,they haven't lost it yet . the war still rages .
10518,well they are fighting a defensive war and momentum is tipping in their favour now . so i wouldn't say thats an indicator of them losing .
10519,"people constantly look at territorial losses and gains to gauge the war but they don't really mean that much . if russia fights a battle where they gain control of another 1 % of the country but it costs them 20,000 soldiers , 1,000 tanks , and 100 aircraft it's not really a win ."
10520,of course you'd be better off with romania . but romania won't give up its umbrella to help you . ukraine might .
10521,"so this is about the personal interest of the "" leadership ""? that's an interesting take ..."
10522,probably some ethnic reasoning which comes straight out of 1930s germany
10523,"theyre are already in moldova and have been since 1991 , the region of transnistria is occupied by russian troops on a permanent basis despite being the sovereign territory of moldova . and moldova has no army to speak of , if these troops were to march into moldova there wouldnt be much in the way to stop them ."
10524,or at least off to the left of the front lines 
10525,"with civilians , that probably doesn't matter that much . or maybe they are attacking civilians because they can't hit military targets ?"
10526,honestly nato isnt bad . its just a defensive alliance . the member states have gotten involved in some questionable conflicts . but nato itself is an effective and good peace keeping tool . even today its likely protecting the baltic countries from russia and the balkans from each other and/or serbia .
10527,nato is in general bad ? what ? i think you mean the members of nato because when the us invades a country it isn't nato it is the us .
10528,lol nato isnt bad . reddit is dumb and falls for anti usa propaganda sue to not actually learning
10529,nato is so bad that most of europe wants to join it for defense . alright sergei
10530,the enemy of my enemy is my friend i guess
10531,because then people many people will start to get funny ideas about america
10532,2nd worst .
10533,i feel that if you were stuck in the east and getting across ukraine was clearly not an option . that would be a super tough life decision ! something i wouldnt want to face !
10534,"far more have been forcibly deported to russia , to be conscripted and/or sent to isolated regions . they never had a choice . these are same tactics russia used against the population of the baltic states in the 1940s . most never made it back alive ."
10535,oh i figured it was going to be sebastian gorka
10536,he will return one day and then commit an act of terrorism . i'd hope the cia is keeping an eye on him .
10537,only thing i dont understand .. is how wasnt his passport flagged once he got into the eu or ukraine !?
10538,"i have friends in belerus who hate both russia and lukaschenko , and who would gladly support ukrainians if the opportunity was possible . i dont think many ukrainians want to go to belarus and for good reason , but please dont assume that everyone whose individual circumstances led them there are anti-ukraine . some are assholes , sure , and some probably just had family there and nowhere else to go ."
10539,syria is largely a frozen war with most of the country under saa control
10540,cisdniester
10541,"transalpine , cisalpine . it's all about the pine , baby ."
10542,and nobody cares that they usually shoot the men and dump them in a ditch .
10543,no they do not .
10544,oh ok . a perfectly healthy western democracy : requires you to stay in the closet
10545,"you know that you can't just "" hide "" that kind of stuff , right ?"
10546,yeah and much closer for others .
10547,russia can barely hold the small amount of territory they can hold in ukraine . i doubt they are making it to moldova .
10548,"> moldova would first need to build sizeable army , train it and equip it . moldova , use this time and experience well , train up . [ bruce lee : be like water inspirational ]( ** 0:23 ** "" i am bruce lee """

10550,that neutrality is doing nothing for them . they should get rid of transnistria and join nato
10551,"yeah , but since not long ago we can recruit in our army citizens of other countries . like nato soldiers ..."
10552,that neutrality might mean they won't be invaded in the first place .
10553,this went neg 2 right away then shot up .
10554,it's the closest thing to a victory they can manage these days .
10555,"it went neg 2 instantly , like in 5 seconds , a minute later it went up ."
10556,"in what world is klaus iohannis an pro russian authoritarian , lol he was at kiev with the german , french and european chancellor . ( )"
10557,romania would have something to gain from moldova's security . namely the fact that it would keep russia from their border
10558,> even if romania wasn't ran by a pro-russian authoritarian how do you even get to such an ignorant conclusion ?
10559,"no , its not because of grammar . its because moldovans are romanians who are brainwashed into thinking theyre ethnically russian"
10560,yes so the plan is basically don't let them or die trying
10561,"this is just my own conjecture , but the russians in transnistria happen to be sitting on one the largest ammo dumps in the world , one that is in very poor condition and within artillery range of the ukrainian border . if it were to be destroyed , the resulting explosion would pretty much obliterate the bulk of the russian force . along with a nearby village , unfortunately "
10562,"it's indeed a stalemate , but it's a very flimsy strip of land . i can see why they're worried ."
10563,"and what has happened most recently has shown and proven to both europe and the wider west that both the eu and nato are not only justified in their existences , but necessary . and those two alliances/organizations had been under serious questioning over the last few years ."
10564,finally someone whos not talking out of his ass
10565,minor inconvenience at best .
10566,i mean all they gotta do is blow up a bridge basically lol . its like ten feet of ukraine until moldova .
10567,barely ! the nation's borders practically kiss the dniester estuary which leads to the black sea
10568,"they can do a mean pirogue as well , don't forget !"
10569,"was moldova the epic sax guy country , i take it ? edit : of course . takes me back to the good ol days of the internet ."
10570,and folklore and rock and roll
10571,indeed
10572,still probably better troops than russia right now
10573,"> she said if they get invaded , then invaders would have to feed everyone there , which isnt necessarily a bad thing according to her kinda like how nazi germany fed the russians when they invaded russia ? they dont have to do shit for the local populace ."
10574,"ah yes , all those people piled up in mass graves in bucha with bullets in their heads and hands tied were very well fed by the russians , im confident"
10575,"no , op is saying moldova's military is ill-equipped . but moldova isn't doing that because they've directed all of their money to building statues ... moldova's military is ill-equipped because moldova is poor ."
10576,"nobody wants haiti . russia wants full control over the region , notably the european plain . russia already has a donbas-esque region in moldova called transnistria , so the groundwork is in place for another special military operation ."
10577,"seriously ? moldova has a similar history with russia as ukraine . it is also a former soviet republic and used to be a part of the russian empire . aside from that , you do realize moldova currently has a problem with russia creating a breakaway region there too ? the situation with moldova is very comparable to ukraine ."
10578,> nobody is looking to invade haiti either . except for all the times that haiti has been invaded by france or the us .
10579,haiti is a top contender for the record for most invasions by the us . twice in the 20th century . that doesn't count all the times we send troops down there to help rebuild after hurricanes .
10580,"my favorite is where moldova declares war on a nato nation , invades with a platoon and then unconditionally surrenders putting moldova under nato jurisdiction . not gonna happen , but hilarious conceptually ."
10581,"that's russian propaganda . here in romania we have a pro-russian party that claims it's pro unification , while its leader is banned from entering moldova . the only way a ' unification ' will take place is if moldova enters the eu , but they have corruption problems and it'll take time ."
10582,"yes of course , it is not 100 % the government's fault . but you missed my point . in tough times the government should come to the aid of people no ? not extort them further . and consider that all of this is happening while a lot of companies haven't even recovered from the covid consequences . also during that whole covid thing we didn't have stimulus packages or any real meaningful help . of yeah they offered companies like ours like one or two months of delayed interest payments on loans ... yey ..."
10583,change the constitution .
10584,actually ukriane is forced to keep an army on that border anyway in case russians try something . eliminating that threat would free up ukrianian troops for more active parts of the front .
10585,"russia has to take odessa for that . and if they can create that land link to moldova , then yes they will be invaded"
10586,them and kazakhstan .
10587,"what's the value of moldova ? ukraine has natural resources , grain , and ports but i don't know much about moldova . does it have a strategic or resource value or would it be more of just annexation of territory ?"
10588,fuck id take some fucking billy madison type . gotta be one of them among them rich fuckers
10589,"and putin's actions aren't exactly unorthodox for a russian nationalist from the moment he came into power : he stabilized russia's economic situation and stopped any further breakaway regions , and slowly , but surely he has been picking up the pieces of the former soviet union . putin's eventual successor is likely going to be of a nearly identical worldview ."
10590,probably that fuck medvedev .
10591,gotcha . didnt read it that way originally
10592,"and the recently discovered , 10 years ago i think , in the eastern part of the country . which by coincidence alone , is where russia is focusing it's occupation forces ..."
10593,well that too . but resources in general and ukraine is the breadbasket of europe
10594,"providing financial support , intelligence and selling weapons to a country are very different than rescue , and on an entirely different level than standing up to a hostile nation ."
10595,that won't help because moldova has less than 10 % of ukraine's population and basically no real military . nato has been arming and training ukraine since russian invaded crimea in 2013 .
10596,"they can receive similar aid but if they don't have the soldiers to fight the aid is not going to be enough . moldova only has 2.6 million people so not as much to recruit from . ukraine has 40 million people to fight . it's also a lot easier to take over because of the much smaller size . nato doesn't want to fight russia unless it absolutely has to fight russia . putin could get scared then launch some nukes . nato wants to avoid that . right now giving money , weapons , intelligence , training , food , etc to ukraine seems to be working . the thing is it's going to take more time . if some how trump or desantis gets elected in the us a good deal of that help is going to disappear ."
10597,sounds like a solid play actually . focus some of the ukrainian forces on another front even if just for a bit . dont see transnistria going for it though .
10598,im not saying they would try and invade tomorrow or even next month but i think maldovas fears are justified . especially if they grab more land in southern ukraine
10599,"i meant easy relative to ukraine . if romania,slovakia and bulgaria didnt come to the aid of ukraine , i doubt they will go to war over maldova unless theres a military treaty between them im unaware of . considering the surrounding countries are nato countries that might very well trigger article 5 . i just dont see them doing that over maldova though i could be wrong"
10600,"nor do they need to win . they just need to not lose , just like vietnam , korea and afghanistan . theres only so long russia can fight ."
10601,til losing 40 % of your land means your winning a war .
10602,"oh no no . im saying.....if you want to talk about one country absorbing the other for mutual benefit , then the absorbing country should probably give a little in return ."
10603,"moldova * does * have a small standing army , not much of one , but it would probably be enough to stop the 1500 russians in transnistria from trying to do some shit ."
10604,"well , other than a nato/eu security guarantee ."
10605,"and in my opinion , greece and turkey from biting eachothers throat"
10606,"yeah , it so defensively bombed belgrade . it's not defensive and not an alliance . it's a us tool ."
10607,"re-read what he said , clearly he doesn't agree with the sentiment . follow what you preach and learn to type as well as read ."
10608,"well , nato does indeed protect its members against agressions , but also have done some terrible stuff in africa and the middle east . though its more up to you to search on it ."
10609,"yeah for sure , also its important to note plenty of ukrainians simply have family in russia so it made sense to just go there and stay with them ."
10610,"if he comes back it would be mostly the fbi . fun fact , lee harvey oswald ran away to soviet russia before shooting jfk . who , by the way , also spent time in belarus after defecting . cool ."
10611,"the 2 bff's that everyone hates , putin and lulaschenko"
10612,that's just regular moldova .
10613,"chrisalpine ? also , don't know who this alfred pine character is ."
10614,what are you referring to exactly ?
10615,"i mean - kill the men , dump them in the ditch has been standard operating procedure during wars for millennia ."
10616,gay and men arent exclusive
10617,sure women might have a better chance of living but getting brutally raped and possibly worse and then living is probably just as bad .
10618,really ? dont they have anti lgbtq zones and barbaric abortion laws ?
10619,worth noting that the area russia has taken is about half the size of the uk . not really a small amount .
10620,by the small amount of territory you mean territory larger than great britain ?
10621,they are outnumbered and fighting a nato trained and armed army across fortress donbas that has 8 years of entrenchment built . i'd take it slow and use a lot of standoff weapons as well .
10622,"small amount of territory ?! what kind of wishful thinking is that . i wouldn't call 125.000 km2 (~ 50.000 miles2 ) (~ 20 % of ukraine's territory ) anything near a ' small amount '. any ' barely hold it '?. it's sad news but june and july have been the most successful months of the invasion for russia . their consolidation of donesk and luhansk is going according to plan . and they are heavily entrenched in the southern part of ukraine . taking that back will come at the cost of many many ukrainian lives . they are literally using a nuclear plant as military base , which means it's nearly impossible to retake that without risking a nuclear disaster , and even if it would succeed , why wouldn't the russians blow it up on their retreat ? they have never shown the most basic deceny . some people hate to face reality , but wishful thinking is deceptive and doesn't do anything but ' generate ' a false feeling of victory in your brain ."
10623,"insert russia seeing another part of moldova with russians being "" mistreated "", and some separatists who are suspiciously well armed creating a new disputed territory"
10624,reunification with romania could be the better choice i believe .
10625,yeah man giving up your sovereignty sure is a solution to a foreign nation taking over .
10626,> that neutrality might mean they won't be invaded in the first place . not a chance .
10627,"ah , neutrality ; yep , no neutral country has ever been invaded or threatened by a hostile occupation force hint : to most expansionist imperial powers/fascist dictatorships , "" neutrality "" is the same as being an enemy , it just means you have less guns and no allies manning your border"
10628,"that would be nice if it was the case , but it didn't help belgium . neutrality only helps so long as the larger power doesn't have a reason to invade or think the potential fight is worth it , which is how switzerland and sweden managed to keep themselves neutral for the most part ( though even that always had caveats )."
10629,"because russia will surely respect their neutrality , as they respected the signed agreement in odessa ."
10630,they already were in the exact same way ukraine was in 2014 .
10631,you know i didn't think it was possible to be this incorrect .
10632,"> that neutrality might mean they won't be invaded in the first place . i see somebody didn't learn from ukraine . they [ gave up their warheads - granted , the codes were in moscow - for pledges of neutrality in 1994 .]( russia installed a puppet dictator in 2004 and invaded 2014 . russia and ukraine were supposedly better than neutral , they were ostensibly "" allies "" since 2003 . how'd that work out for ukraine ? at every turn russia proves its promises aren't worth the ink spent to sign them . no surprise [ when they chose to incorporate the worst parts of the mongolian raiders .]("
10633,russia doesn't follow through with signed-off peace treaties and pacts ; do you really believe that they'll honour the concept of neutral nations ?
10634,"neutrality works if you have geography on your side and a capable army . switzerland is basically a natural fortress and it has a really strong army for the size of the country . it also is surrounded by friendly countries . sweden and finland had a really big armies during the cold war , and their armies are still quite big and effective . they have also recently decided to join nato ."
10635,"neutral moldova was invaded by russians and "" separatists "" in the early 1990s . you're going to have to explain why being neutral will protect them ** this time **."
10636,so did mine ... - 3 and now its 2
10637,"romania is only formally led by the president , the actual power resides with the prime minister . that said , i don't think ciuca is pro-russian , just corrupt ."
10638,"would that be a shame ... the village , i mean ."
10639,i think its rather obvious how putin and russian intelligence were doing all they could to push this question . then putin got impatient . its terrifying how much worse this could all be if putin was more competent .
10640,russia trying to mount an amphibious operation would be absolutely devastating . to me . if it wasn't captured on video . because i would love to see a bunch of invaders in shitty fishing boats with z's painted on them floundering in the black sea ..
10641,russia has had icebreaker ships for years . maybe they will unveil landbreaker ships . probably just waiting for the right moment
10642,an amphibious invasion is not a minor inconvenience .
10643,"might have been minor , if they didn't get their asses handed to them on the snake island . if they had complete control and could place sams there they might have had some chance . but as it stands - they will be fucked more than ever if they try . which is not to say that i don't want to see them get fucked some more , but come on , even their idiocy has it's limits ."
10644,ya i just looked at the map and its around 20ish miles from the sea to moldova at the shortest distance .
10645,ayo let them reach canada in that case
10646,majority of russian troops are rural conscripts themselves .
10647,> kinda like how nazi germany fed the russians when they invaded russia ? they dont have to do shit for the local populace . she's being a bit humourous i suppose . basically her point is that there's nothing invaders can gain from moldova . it's just a bunch of very poor people that will soak up russian resources if they desire to keep the country .
10648,"according to this article , the european plain stretches through northern germany and hooks around mountains down to south western france . yikes ."
10649,are you thinking of [ the mouse that roared ](
10650,"ok , tell me how lack of help ( from your perspective ), is equal to extortion ? as far i remember government do have social plans and implement them . and considering how much refugees per own citizen and overall destabilization in region moldavian government is doing pretty good . do you think , eu would offer republic of moldova candidate membership in ue if they would consider their government incompetently and corrupts ?"
10651,those fuckers are a long way from odessa . hopefully ukraine will push them further away .
10652,"and unless we see china wake up tomorrow and actively supply russia , it's not going to happen . 5 months in and this is all russia has been able to achieve and hold . now's when sanctions and hardware issues will begin to plague russias ability to conduct an offensive war ."
10653,i understand being scared if you're moldova but russia will need to pull out the ace up their sleeve or mobilize the whole country to take odessa .
10654,"kazakhstan and other ' stans ' haven't really been under any pressure at all , surprisingly . that's what tells me this war in ukraine is more about the west than ukraine . russia would have walked over the stans because i doubt the west would have back them quite the same ."
10655,any territory is valuable to imperialists .
10656,"bessarabia is the historic name of the region that is basically moldova and the ukrainian territory to the south ( the mouth of the danube on the black sea ). russia has long focused on the strategic importance of control of the region . its not as strategically important in the modern world , but that doesnt matter to putin . moldova isnt in nato and cant defend itself . he pushes a narrative that what was once controlled by moscow should still be controlled by moscow . if russia managed to take odessa then there is no doubt theyd quickly look to take moldova ."
10657,lol no he's just a toad nobody actually likes him .
10658,"yeah . the weapons and funds would help moldova a lot , but they'll have to fight russia by themselves - no western boots on the ground ."
10659,"opposite . the garrison in transnistria is keeping a portion of ukraine's forces occupied in case they do something , and keeping moldova on edge . if they act , they get destroyed quickly , ukraine no longer has to worry about that flank , and russia loses a lot of it's influence over moldova ."
10660,"not really . as it currently stands , they're already tying up ukrainian forces and resources just existing and being a potential threat . the moment they become actively hostile , ukraine can destroy the threat and move on to other areas . it's a similar story with belarus , how them just threatening to invade ties up more resources for longer than if they actually did invade and lost ."
10661,"unlike ukraine , theres no border with russia . unlike ukraine , any foreign intervention will be an immediate victory that ends the war shortly . unlike ukraine theres no supply line directly to russia . this isnt an article 5 situation , its more of a serbia situation . they know theyre outmatched by a mile . thats why this hasnt happened ."
10662,i think there is more of a chance for ukraine to come in . they certainly would not like russia to build up their forces there . last i heard only a couple of thousand russian troops are there and they are relatively isolated . i mean the black sea fleet is smaller nowadays .
10663,"well russia has the advantage of not being very democratic so putin doesnt really have to worry about reelection . and biden still got a ton of hate for pulling out of afghanistan . in russia , i assume ending the war will basically be the end of putins career"
10664,"there is more to a war than territorial extent . of course 20 % or 40 % isn't good for ukraine , but it isn't as important as other factors because the production of equipment and humanitarian goods mostly doesn't happen on ukrainian soil anyway ."
10665,""" absorbing ""? it's would be the unification of one single people . there is no "" absorbing "". the west didn't absorb the east in germany . merkel is from the east , by the way ."
10666,they don't have enough of an army to kick 1500 foreign troops out of their country . the army/police forces they do have are as corrupt as russia . they aren't really in a good position to defend what little democracy they have .
10667,but moldova isn't a full nato member [ and just has an action plan ]( nor is it an eu member .
10668,boomers ruined everything
10669,tell me you're russian without saying you're russian .
10670,youre a fucking idiot dude . they were right to bomb belgrade because genocide was being committed
10671,"this is such a loser argument . it's so funny that this is the only example you can ever bring up against nato and they did it to stop literal ethnic cleansing , and the result killed maybe 500 civilians in total . dumbfucks would rather let ethnic cleansing and genocide continue than see the us be on the right side of anything . or perhaps you're a genocide denier , or supporter yourself ?"
10672,i think you mean that nato members have done some terrible stuff . people keep mixing up what the us does and what nato does .
10673,"so "" some vague terrible stuff in the past "" that you won't name makes the alliance that secures most of the world's democracies against aggression "" bad "". okay ."
10674,no it didnt . what it did in the middle east and africa was ensure the oil was maintained so that hundreds of millions didnt starve . you can either have nato intervention or you can have a million countries like russia that use energy as a weapon . google it lmao .
10675,"problem is putin is probably keeping track of those from ukraine . i dont know what hes doing with them , i hope he doesnt hurt them ."
10676,i don't think putin really likes lukashenko that much
10677,"its kind of weird how much the situation between putin and lulaschenko is like hitler and mussolini . for example , hitler had great control over germany where as mussolini did not over italy . putin has a strangle on russia but lulaschenko cant even deploy his forces for fear he will face a rebellion at home ."
10678,with the pronoun mld .
10679,stan and ford's less-storied triplet
10680,"probably the fact that despite not being a marginalised or disempowered group , its the men who are most at risk of being killed by invading soldiers ; they are the ones who are drafted to fight , and even when they arent they are seen as a bigger potential threat than female non-combatants ."
10681,"i don't think you would be put in prison for being gay like in russia . there is much more freedom and openly gay friendly establishments as well . lgbt free zones were a gimmick of a number of braindead "" catholiban "" rednecks that happened to own businesses , it was not a nationwide policy . but yes , still radically catholic with fucked up abortion laws and corrupted judicial system and government . on all other counts the life is much better in poland than in russia ."
10682,"hello , american living in poland here . the lgbtq zones are just masturbatory virtue signaling from religious fundamentalists that have no actual power . some of these "" zones "" have been struck down by various courts . pride events occur regularly and although the police did nothing to protect marchers from lunatics at first , these events go on normally for the most part . yes , poland does have horrendous abortion laws , put into place by a rigged equivalent of the supreme court . it's not as horrendous as malta ( which nearly killed an american woman recently over the issue ) or texas ( i think you know what's going on there ). public opinion on the legalization of both same sex rights and abortion rights are becoming more favorable . by pushing the religion angle so hard , the polish government has turned public opinion against the church and their key policies . there is some hope that these fuckers will be voted out next year ."
10683,"don't exaggerate . in major cities we don't give a fuck what is your orientation . the fact that there are news about homophobic politicians and policies does not mean that a normal person cares about that stuff . it is just a distraction play from the gov . we care about inflation and interest rates and care about anti eu remarks by the gov . we don't go and bash lgbt on the streets as in russia . anti lgbt zones were introduced by smaller municipal areas to win favor from the gov and money of course . there are however minor cities where a mayor is gay ( not openly ) and everybody knows about that and nobody gives a shit . they are only sorry for his wife . a divorce would be shameful ... this does not mean that we are progressive enough that you can do your thing on major sporting events :) most probably however neither is uk nor france :) abortion laws are a pis play to win the church and far right movements . winning the church means you gain a lot of 50 + electorate . i hope however that pis days of spewing hate will be over soon . they also like to incite hate between - miners - teachers - medical staff - everybody who immigrated - shop owners - small business owners - it workers -... the list goes on and on . that is just their way of distracting people from failing policies . as inflation rises , ir rates rise , ppl stop caring about shit they say . hopefully as things go to shit ppl will change the political scene in 2023"
10684,"wait , are we talking about poland , or certain parts of america now ?"
10685,right now russia can't send any new troops to moldova or bring in any new weapons bc ukraine closed the corridor they were previously using and moldova is blocking transit . edit : only a few thousand troops there right now .
10686,"ok . but do they already have the supples to invade and take over the country ? ( because that requires equipment and supplies on different level than for "" being there ""). becausethey are not getting more any time soon ."
10687,i bet the locals would fightback if they did .
10688,"the vast majority of that 20 % was already under separatist/russian control prior to the current war . it's relative - after the northern axis of russian invasion collapsed , and after losing ground in the south and around kharkiv , russians control only a fraction of what they once did , just a few months ago . doesn't mean everything is peachy for ukraine , or that victory is assured , but in a war of attrition , stalling an advance while pounding logistics/supply again and again every day ( including strikes far behind russian lines now , due to himars/m270/rocket-assisted 155mm shells and other long-range weapons ) is exactly how you grind your enemy down . ultimately it will be the success or failure of counter-offensives that tell the story , but the success or failure of those missions is very much dictated by the level of attrition being inflicted on the defending side , which is what we're seeing now , especially on the southern front . so there's at least grounds for cautious optimism ."
10689,""" i agree "" comments are frequently posted by bots . the person i replied to is a many years old account with almost 0 karma , here with the most generic comment possible at the top of a frontpage post . when i call them out directly as bots they often delete their comments , so i thought i'd try something subtler first ."
10690,"russia can barely supply its own troops in ukraine let alone stranded troops on the other end of it in another country . fwiw , ukraine has already offered to flush the russians out of transnistria if moldova gives the word...or if the russians get an idea to try and start shit around odesa . that said , transnistria is already better armed and has a larger military than moldova but nothing romania ( unification ) and/or ukraine ( sw invasion ) couldn't handle in a few days . ukraine is focused on kherson , though , and doesn't need the distraction ."
10691,"that would be gagauzia , a collection of villages of around 150,000 people in moldova's south that has autonomous status and constantly serves as moscow's other thorn in the side of any liberal moldovan government . it wouldn't survive on its own , and is funded almost entirely through moldova and the eu , but russia funds numerous social clubs there , where old men can hang out and hear about how great mother russia is and how evil the west is ."
10692,"weirdly , its the best option . romania is uncomfortable with the idea and so is moldova , but we live in odd times ."
10693,"switzerland maintained its "" neutrality "" by taking gold the nazis stole from jews and others . they also accepted "" vacationing jews passing through "" if they could pay enough , and called that balance . they've been laundering money from across the world for decades ."
10694,> they already were in the exact same way ukraine was in 2014 . arguably worse . russia's been [ illegally occupying them since 1991 ](
10695,that's literally how reddit worked though . refresh and watch your count bounce up and down
10696,"romania is a semi-presidential republic , which means that that while the president role isn't as important as the french president is , it isn't purely symbolic either , like in germany or italy . both the president and the prime minister ' rule ' the country . they're both clowns and terrible at their jobs , but that's another issue . le : spelling ."
10697,"lol the though of this . you can just see the fat russian generals on the big ships face palming while the recruits manage to capsize their armoured amphibious vehicle in shallow water . the ukrainians feel so embarrassed for the russian troops they help them right their vehicle , and then the russian troops end up heading back out to sea past the generals ."
10698,there is a bit of ukraine in the way
10699,hence the stolen toilets !
10700,"thats a very naive way to look at it . theres land to be gained , the local population can always be replaced with russians ."
10701,"they don't need to control it all , just enough to where it narrows , so it's less border to defend . right now the russian border is thousands of km of perfect tank driving land ( assuming you don't do it in spring ...) ideally , russia takes over poland where the plain narrows down to be within 1 country . however , since they're nato , russia will have to settle for second best . having soft or hard control over ukraine , moldova , belarus , and kaliningrad basically blocks all potential european ground assault to ' russia proper '."
10702,"that's new to me , decent flick ? premise sounds neat ."
10703,""" will begin "" people have been saying this throughout the entire war , every single day . i've yet to see it make any effect other than minir inconvenience"
10704,"there's been a fair bit of speculation that kazakhstan is being backed by china against russia , and that chinese pressure is the reason russian forces left after crushing the protests there earlier this year ."
10705,this thought experiment is moot . you can drive from one end of moldova to the other in 3 hours . moldova will more than likely fall in the initial strike . there's no way to help moldova in time .
10706,trump started the pulling out of afghanistan decision .
10707,"that's why i said security guarantee , not membership ."
10708,it was however a violation of the terms of the agreement ( even if morally justifiable )
10709,also every country in unsc approved the action except for russia and china who used their veto power . our human rights champions .
10710,it is genuinely amazing that so many morons think that the usa is after oil always . have you seen the usa economy ? we dont need it . the world needs it and we are the only one strong enough to do the job . that is why nato always agrees . even out enemies like russia actually always agree .
10711,usa is always backed by nato . please stop being dumb . with you anti usa message so poorly informed it is amazing .
10712,"i mean , nato does some pretty good stuff . its just that bad things are relatively more impactful than the good things . but fair enough ."
10713,"starting to round up and kill ukrainians in russia would be a very risky move for putin . unless done very carefully amd gradually , it would make the rounds on russian social media . i'm hopefully optimistic they'll be fine ."
10714,"not getting hurt , but the ones without family/friends are a bit screwed there , as the refugee system is definitely not the same there as germany for example . there are a lot of volunteers risking their lives trying to move refugees out of russia to estonia , to be eu processed"
10715,"they don't have the love/greed-light in their eyes the way some other leaders do around putin . lukashenko has fear-light in his eyes , along with a ton of greed-light ."
10716,"out of the 5k ukrainian casualties reported on july 12 , 38 % were men and 26 % were women ( rest were children and gender undetermined .) while the men may be killed and thrown in ditches , the women are more likely to be raped and/or sex trafficked before their deaths ."
10717,don't forget that man can't even leave the country to begin with
10718,"it seems strange to leave out the other obvious point , that the women and girls will be raped . war is hell for everyone ."
10719,"they dont kill women because they want to keep them alive to rape them . i think death would be a better choice . also look at the other side of the coin : its primarily men doing the invading , not women ."
10720,we are talking about these countries having low rights for gay/trans and women . with poland having made abortion illegal and gay marriage not acceptable in many of these countries ..
10721,> i don't think you would be put in prison for being gay like in russia . this is true . [ here's an openly-gay mep for example ](
10722,"> we don't go and bash lgbt on the streets as in russia not as much anymore , but don't tell me with a straight face that it hasn't happened . ask biaystok , lublin and pock about it . > abortion laws are a pis play to win the church and far right movements . winning the church means you gain a lot of 50 + electorate you'll notice that basically nobody under 40 goes to pis rallies . > the fact that there are news about homophobic politicians and policies does not mean that a normal person cares about that stuff . it is just a distraction play from the gov . tell jarosaw kaczyski to shut the fuck up then - he was prattling on and on about "" demoralization of children "" yesterday . don't even get me started on czarnek ."
10723,i was thinking they might go by sea but they'd have to go through ukraine or romania i suppose .....
10724,up until last year moldova had a very pro-russia government and my understanding is that while younger generations are more progressive and anti-russia there are many in the older generations that would welcome them
10725,"i would not bet on that . do you remember the videos of whole ua making molotovs to fight the invaders ? now how many of these were really used by the locals ? when the real shit hits the fan , the civilians will rather cover in the basement , than heroically go against tanks with molotovs ."
10726,"am not sure they are that uncomfortable with it , primarily talking about common people . economically and politically speaking it would create lot of difficulties as disparity would be quite large but in the end they should come out stronger ."
10727,"the problem is , moldova is fucking poor . like the poorest country in europe . romania is already in a bad economic position , taking on moldova would be a major challenge ."
10728,"many , if not most , romanians already view moldovans as related and wouldn't be opposed to reunification . i think it's more on the moldovan side , and maybe largely , a lack of political will . moldovans are already the poorest in europe . they deal with some of the highest levels of corruption and aren't eager to be subject to romanian corruption , too . their political leaders also aren't keen to give up their own fiefdom and be subject to a larger nation's laws and control as a minority state , particularly where eu law could be used against them like a bag of hammers . it would also likely trigger a conflict with transnistria ( which would be swiftly dealt with by the nato-trained romanian military ). but , yes , for all these stated reasons , it would probably be best for the average moldovan in the medium-to-long term . personally , i would try for a confederation . moldova gets protection , stability , and eu institutions . romania helps out its brethren and gets rid of a constant pro-russian thorn in its back yard . eventually , they can hold a referendum to stick together or not . either way , they're both eu states , transnistria is gone , and so are the russians . the only concern is whether romania can handle that kind of drag on its economy without collapsing . definitely would require u backing ."
10729,"the president would have some extended and very significant powers if we went to war , but in regular politics he can propose people to be appointed for functions and veto laws * once * by sending them to the constitutional court . in romania the president is purely decorative vis a vis internal politics , barring corruption . * externally * he can sign treaties and generally represent the country , which iohannis has been very good at . what you see as him being terrible at his job is just him not overstepping his official job description ( which was one of his original election promises )."
10730,"people seriously underestimate the logistics necessary to carry out amphibious operations . there's a reason the germans didn't see d-day coming , at best expecting something similar at the narrower calais crossing , and didn't invade the uk themselves . we're talking about the invading force that couldn't drive 100km into ukraine without creating a traffic jam that got bombarded to hell . if they try anything amphibious , they're going to get absolutely crushed . especially given the degree to which naval operations can be undermined by the level of omniscience western intelligence provides to ukraine via spy satellites . damn , it's almost midnight . time to go to bed and dream of russian invaders in dinghies being bayraktar'd "
10731,land is the one thing russians have plenty of .
10732,russia isnt in this for lebensraum lol .
10733,this was my 9th grade theatre production . i haven't thought about it in years . i was the narrator .
10734,"this is where critical thinking and inference into what sanctions will eventually bleed into really make a difference on how people can disseminate what is happening . read more , conceptualize it , keep reading ."
10735,"initially it is minor inconveniences , they start like that because russia had their best equipment in the best condition they could present it in . now though theyre beginning to have to scrape the bottom of the barrel , they cant easily replace any of their equipment , their money is trickling in far slower than it did before , sure theyre selling oil still , but its at pennies on the dollar compared to what it was before . they didnt really have the industry to produce their best equipment in meaningful capacities before , the sanctions make it almost impossible now . theyre fighting against a newer peer force and both sides are going through a considerable amount of equipment , but ukraine is the only one of the two who can reliably replace it ."
10736,started sure . but the people trying to ride on the outside of planes happened under biden so he will always be the one associated with it .
10737,"fair point , my mistake ."
10738,"that is highly debated - nato described the conditions in kosovo as posing a risk to regional stability . as such , nato and certain governments asserted they had a legitimate interest in developments in kosovo , due to their impact on the stability of the whole region which , they claimed , is a legitimate concern of the organisation . a draft resolution , tabled jointly by russia , belarus and india , to demand "" an immediate cessation of the use of force against the federal republic of yugoslavia "" was defeated . among the 15 un security council nations , there were three votes in favour ( russia , china and namibia ) and twelve against , with no abstentions . argentina , bahrain , brazil , gabon , gambia , malaysia , and slovenia , along with the us , britain , france , canada , and netherlands voted against it"
10739,"you're delusional . look at the countries usa involved in their foreign policy venezuela , iraq , saudi arabia . of course they care about oil ."
10740,i mean the only thing russia can do to nato is destroying the world which means nobody wins
10741,"remember the iraqi war ? other nato members were not very supportive , were they ?"
10742,"what bad has come from nato ? some nato members have done bad things , but how is that relevant to nato itself ?"
10743,death is definitely not a better choice . people say stuff like this but given the choice almost everyone is going to wish to keep living . nothing is more final than death .
10744,you'd be surprised how often men are raped in war . but how is the gender of the perpetrator at all relevant to how much we should care about the victim ?
10745,abortion could be the deciding factor since many women were raped during this war . it was so bad for some that they literally died from rape-induced injuries .
10746,"no , we are talking about war . where death and suffering is a much bigger issue ."
10747,"when you were fed shit sandwiches during the cold war and now you can barely get those because you're so shit-poor , of course you'll harken back to the good ol ' days when you could at least pretend to be fed . the younger folks don't have that to fall back on . they see the status quo isn't working , and russia will only make things worse . the eu is the only real choice here ."
10748,"well considering russia didn't attempt to occupy any major cities , we don't know anything do we ? i bet the civilian uprising would have been catastrophic for the russians ."
10749,no . some will but some wont . civilians can still significantly fuck up an occupiers intentions as history has proven repeatedly .
10750,"don't need to go stand in front of a tank heroically , just toss the bloody thing from a window or a balcony . what are they going to do when fiery surprise can come from any window ? this is why at the start russians just went around chernihiv and sumy , they couldn't deal with this shit ."
10751,are you capable of identifying fire hydrants and crosswalks by yourself ? i dont think youre a bot i just really want to know
10752,sounds like a great time for germany and france to kick them some unification assistanc. 
10753,"> the president is purely decorative the role has been eroded in the past two decades , largely because psd failed to win presidential elections time and time again . > which iohannis has been very good at debatable . ro is largely irrelevant , so there's nothing much to do . his greatest achievement is simply being quiet and not fuckin up , other than that i don't think we could find anything to praise him for . his biggest achievement comes from internal politics , when he unexpectedly showed up at and presided a government meeting ( so he wasn't purely decorative ) thus delaying the passage of a government decision to low key legalise corruption , which in turn encouraged people to go out and protest . naturally , nothing good lasts so he latter showed his true colours by joining forces with psd and being perfectly content with corruption , provided it comes from his side ."
10754,so biden should not have pulled out ?
10755,i love the neighbourliness and decency of this conversation . you're one of the gems of reddit u/rape-putins-corpse
10756,i would rather die than be tortured and raped . that kind of trauma would have lasting impacts on my life . i already struggle with mental illness .
10757,"no , read the thread its about people fleeing to poland instead of moldova and poland being a bad option for women and lgbt + people"
10758,"well , the other will probably level the whole aparment building down ."
10759,i agree !
10760,"the problem is not the money , with which the eu can help , or the popular opinion , which is mostly pro union . problem is that the romanian constitution does not allow for separatist states or autonomous regions while moldovan constitution does . moldova has 2 autonomous regions , gagauzia and transnistria . having a reunification wouls either mean that those 2 lose their autonomous status or the ethnic hungarian minority that is in szkely/inutul secuiesc will get autonomy which wil piss off most of the romanians ."
10761,what expansionist imperialism does to a mf . you just always crave more land .
10762,"well , ukraine would be strategically important to russia if nato was actually aggressive . i don't know if the same can be said about moldova ."
10763,"ukraine has the most untapped oil reserves in europe ( other than russia i think ), the invasion , as poorly as its gone for russia , was an economic move more so than anything else . invading ukraine also ( theoretically ) would give russia better warm water ports . moldova is landlocked"
10764,of course he should have . that was my entire point from the start lmao . im just saying he got hate for it . now imagine the hate putin would get . right wingers are fucking insane
10765,"you can't win with this one . if you stay or if you pull out , there will be life or death consequences ."
10766,like most of these people had much of a choice and were not literally fleeing for their lives with the nothing but the shirts on their back
10767,fleeingbecause of war . stop trying to force some kind of issue here where there isnt one lol .
10768,"you're the first person to directly say that , and it's this low in the chain"
10769,they could just put in the constitution that the autonomy of transnistria and gagauzia will be preserved .
10770,best we can give them is a ligma corridor
10771,did they provide a corridor at azovstal ? did they leave odessa port alone after the the treaty signed yesterday ? ukraine would be stupid to agree to this ..
10772,"after(predictably ) violating the agreement and bombing odesa , i say they surrender or die . no more agreements or negotiations ."
10773,i agree with russia . ukraine should provide a green corridor for them to escape ukraine . all the way to the hague .
10774,"let them return the azov soldiers . if not , no deal"
10775,no . surrender or be destroyed . enough pussyfooting around those bastards that thinks agreements are only for them and it's ok to ignore any other ones they make .
10776,and meanwhile russia is shooting missiles at odessa . inspite of the treaty they just signed in turkey .
10777,make it green just as aggressor z nazis made it green for defenders of mariupol .
10778,"sure , why not . a green corridor straight straight to a pow camp ."
10779,"russia 100 % knew ukraine wasn't gonna agree to this , nor do the russians gives 2 ducks about their troops . this is just an attempt to make ukraine look bad and further drive their narrative ."
10780,"maybe just surrender ? i swear , these tone deaf russians are worse than the actual nazis ."
10781,surrender or die - pick one
10782,"love this from inside article * def mon follow replying to my conclusion regarding the vysokopillya situation is i might have to redefine my definition of encirclement , for me it has been completely surrounding the enemy . no matter which words used to describe the ruaf situation , the seem to be knee deep in shit . 4:40 am jul 23 , 2022 *"
10783,how many days did you ask to evac troops from azovstal ? tell them they can leave in that many days ...
10784,"they should be offered the same "" green corridor "" that the russians offered ukraine in ilovaisk in 2014 . but since ukraine is a moral country that doesn't commit war crimes , i'm assuming that they'll be given the option to surrender instead and be pows under the geneva convention ."
10785,imagine you call someone a nazi for 5 months and want to kill him because of it and later ask him to let you go instead of arresting or killing you . one part of this story is bullshit .
10786,"they ask green corridors hours later a bombardment on odessa commercial port ... 24h later an international pact about secured grain transports ... let a rain of fire fall upon them , burn all those pigs in the mud , don't let a single ruzzian soldier see the dawn of monday . this is what deserves a country whose words are worthless . burn and die"
10787,an encouraging report from kos ! have to love it that russia is asking for a green corridor . i hope ukraine gets lots of prisoners of war to exchange for their warriors of azov .
10788,"while with the other hand , they attack odessa immediately after signing a pledge to not do so . they ** demand ** the very same quarter they would not give . they demand an honor they do not have . fuck them . ** surrender or die **. many of the orcs stuck there would probably welcome the chance to not return to their ranks and its ' brutalizing officers . plus it's one hell of a blow to orc troop morale , as in *"" i wish i was one of those soldiers taken , instead of remaining in these miserable conditions and becoming meat for the grinder , in this pointless invasion we know we are losing "".* edit : changed a few words for clarity , the idea remains the same ."
10789,and it should be provided ......... directly into ukrainian controlled territory ( straight out of ruzzkie playbook ala mariupol )
10790,sure ! as soon as russia brings back to life all the ukrainian children they murdered they can get their green corridor .
10791,what makes the green grass grow ??!!!!
10792,odessa says fuck you . hell is their corridor .
10793,![ img](emote|t5_2qqcn|13047 )
10794,"same treatment as mariupol soldiers ... surrender , or be killed ."
10795,"tell them yes and bomb them anyway , just like they did with mariupol . and make sure to gaslight them by saying youre not bombing them , see how they like it"
10796,"this should be the same "" green corridor "" like they gave us in ilovaisk ."
10797,pows or annihilate them . russia has broken every agreement big or small if it benefits them . they deserve no quarter but i understand ukrainians are moral soldiers that take prisoners .
10798,same green corridor as in [ 2014 ]( russia killed all ukrainians as they were leaving through agreed path . ukraine did not forget about this event .
10799,why is russia that stupid to even consider this as an option ?
10800,either surrender or turn into a hot pocket from arty fire
10801,"they deserve exactly the same kind of response we were given in mariupol . everyone knows what happened there , so i don't need to embroider it ."
10802,hahahahahahahaha rules for thee not for mee get ducked russia
10803,"this must not happen . they must be captured , not let free to be redeployed somewhere else ."
10804,fuck em . bargain their worthless pathetic lives for pows or the million civilians russia carted off . or get them killed . this planet is already suffering from rats infestation . cull the numbers .
10805,"if that's the case , no "" green corridors "". surrender or die ."
10806,heres an idea fuck the green corridor and treat them the same as they treated those at azovstal
10807,give them the same cease fire as russia did for the grain shipments .
10808,would sacriface those iskander missiles just to evaporate that pocket proper . fuck them .
10809,you have to be fucking joking
10810,lol . no country at war would do this
10811,you mean the one like you said you would give to the guys and girls in mariupol . and then launched artillery at . give them nothing !! they die or surrender the choice is theirs . slava ukraini
10812,"how about no ? those troops are going to be demilitarised , one way or another ."
10813,no green corridor . annihilate them . just like theyve done to the ukrainians . finish them off .
10814,i hope they show those fucks the same mercy they showed to women and children . no mercy . fuck them .
10815,they will be drafted into the ukrainian army to kill orcs .
10816,give them a safety corridor that actually leads to a bunch of angry combine harvesters .
10817,hahahaha ....no !
10818,remember ilovaisk august 2018 !
10819,"they can surrender , like the putin nazis forced the azov heroes to do in mariupol ."
10820,remember debaltseve from 2015
10821,trying to steal ukraines fertilizer too ? they can surrender or feed the plants . no humanitarian corridors for people committing crimes against humanity .
10822,is this something that happens in war ? seems counterintuitive to freely let opposing troops out of an encirclement . why even encircle if those were the rules of war ?
10823,do it the russian way . agree and then bomb the shit out of them while they are retreating .
10824,hahahahahahahahahhahhshahahshahahahaha
10825,no fuck you putin .......
10826,trade them for azov .
10827,** do not ** give them anything . they can have a green corridor for body bags only .
10828,how the turntables turn . russia go fuck yourself .
10829,russia bombed odessa after more or less signing a un memorandum they would not . bomb the russian trash .
10830,"nope . your orcs wouldn't even do it for fucking civilians . take it like a man , pootin"
10831,maybe their own idea of a green corridor then ? you let them go then shell the convoys .
10832,"green corridor , civilian corridor , all the same . treat it just like russia treated mariupole"
10833,best i can do is death .
10834,nope orcs must be buried
10835,"aha , right after they bomb the "" green corridor "" for ukrainian grain . that's gonna happen , suuuure ..."
10836,ukraine is way to kind for this type of combat . even the most hateful comments give compassion and a survival option . salava ukraine . i had way more evil plans .
10837,these morons don't know how wars work . they want special rules . fuck them
10838,no corridor they deserve death no pow russia is a pos terrorist organization and must not be catered to anymore
10839,kill every russian that tries to break them out and when they stop trying take them captive and trade them .
10840,"fuck no , don't even consider it ."
10841,"tell them they have 24 hrs to surrender . if they don't , use them to tune up some of the new artillery ."
10842,put the lid on the kettle and turn up the heat . orcs on the barbie !
10843,russians want to have their cake and eat it at the same time . those soldiers should all surrender to ukraine army .
10844,russia : can we please have a green corridor to evacuate troops and equipment ? ukraine : bahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.nope 
10845,just kill them .
10846,no way to give them green corridor . fuck these bastards .
10847,how about no ?
10848,then nuke them after said corridor is setupkind of like the odessa missiles this morning !
10849,"pow is the way to go , azov didn't get a green corridor either"
10850,"no , starve them out , make them surrender ."
10851,nope . they fired on civilians . this is war and if they're allowed to leave they're just gonna restock and come back again .
10852,the russian soldiers can surrender .
10853,first we will invade then we will ask for mercy to retreat ....
10854,kill them all
10855,this encirclement sounds the perfect place to train ukrainian a-10 pilots
10856,they could do the russian type of green corridor . say yes and then bomb and shoot the shit outta them .
10857,they can surrender or die .
10858,"i think zelensky should accept to give green corridor for russian troops , because its the humane thing to do . then ukraine shall shell them to hell . thats the way russia understands ."
10859,"maybe tell them that unarmed troops who have abandoned their weapons may leave on foot in peace ... but that any vehicles , equipment and armed personnel attempting to leave the area will be fired upon . make them forfeit their equipment in order to save their troops . --- allowing these deeply demoralised and broken troops to go back to russia with their tails between their legs and tell of what is happening is probably better for ukraine then having to look after them as pows ."
10860,turntables
10861,"well well well , how the turntables"
10862,nah . hit them with washing machine and toilet artilleries while they're evacuating .
10863,bomb them into submission before the orcs try to recover them .
10864,sure . as long as those troops evacuate into a ukrainian prison
10865,"wait so the people who would not allow safe passage corridors , or agreed to them and then ambushed the people trying to flee.those people now want safe passage corridors for themselves ?! wow"
10866,shell them twice as hard now . fuck them . shouldn't shell odessa after you tell everyone you're gonna let grain exports go out you fucking pricks . the encircled can either surrender or have their friends and family identify the bits and pieces that get sent back in garbage bags . a fitting fate for stupid barbarians .
10867,dont give them a fucking inch !!
10868,"ivan !, the evil jewish nazis will not let us retreat ! we must fire missiles at odessa port to make world starve! but didnt we just sign treaty? hahahahahahahaha ! wut . fire! "
10869,check them for tattoos and send them to concentration camps after shelling the corridor .. whoops wrong side .
10870,funniest thing i've read in days .
10871,"well no , but you got 2 other choices left : pow or kia choose wisley ."
10872,"that would be a no unless they come reciprocate with a huge give on their part , like the return of every single woman , man , and child theyve taken from ukraine ."
10873,"put them all in regular ukranian prisons . this isn't a war , right russia ? so they go to jail for murder or attempting murder ."
10874,say sure then bomb the fu-kers
10875,"lol sure okay , ivan ."
10876,prisoner swap .
10877,surrender or die .
10878,nah .... just keep blasting them . the ruzzian missiles don't stop ? they rain down on ukrainians every day .... no mercy for the 
10879,"wait so i'm hearing mixed info on this encirclement . just yesterday people were saying it's not true , but now apparently it is ? unless these reports are unrelated or something ?"
10880,haha fk them !
10881,oh hell no ....
10882,lol as they bomb odessa after signing a grain transport agreement .
10883,they should say yes and then treat the road in the same manner as the russians did the port .
10884,ukrainians will give them a corridor alright ... a corridor straight to hell !
10885,russia fuck off .
10886,the russian soldiers can surrender and be taken prisoner . that's the best offer .
10887,are the azov soldiers still alive ?
10888,i believe this is karma
10889,no . surrender . or die . your choice putain .
10890,green corridor to hell can be offered .
10891,"why ? you lost , now deal with it . why should russia get "" green corridors "" for * military * soldiers when russia can't grant it ukrainian * civilians *? they can buy them back with sugar and grain ."
10892,"the country that makes and then immediately violates agreements wants ukraine to create a corridor for their murdering , genocidal troops to evacuate ?! thats hilarious fuck ruzzia and most of all fuck pootin"
10893,fuck off . burn the cunts
10894,nazis don't deserve any mercy .
10895,"paint the missles and bombs green ...? sure , why not ?"
10896,just surrender and you can have all the corridors you want .
10897,highway to hell !!!
10898,the ukrainians are systematic and will not give in to ridiculous demands from russian . this is perfect opportunity for ua . they will manage it well .
10899,like the one you gave fighters in mariupol ?
10900,just say no . hell fucking no .
10901,i say give them a green corridor and then proceed to turn it into a second highway of death when enough russians accumulate on it .
10902,"they literally just violated their own agreement by opening fire on a port in ukraine after agreeing to allow flow of goods like grain . fuck off , bitch ass putin ."
10903,did they allow azov to leave ?
10904,after bombing odessa today they have once again proved that we cannot negotiate with terrorists .
10905,i hope ukraine agrees only to bomb them as they attempt to leave
10906,hahahahahahaha nyet .
10907,lol no .
10908,do like the russians do : agree and then bomb the shit out of it .
10909,fuck the orcs . no corridor was given to ukraine during civilian evacuation . no corridor for them .
10910,what a beautiful twist . ukraine asked the same in mariupol and russia made sure to attempt as much carnage as possible . russian war crimes have no extent . ukraine should capture all of those troops and exchange them for all ukrainian citizens forced into russia at the beginning of the war .
10911,"russian "" green corridor "" request go fuck yourself"
10912,fuck no . bomb the russians .
10913,yeah.......how about no !
10914,russians have no honor . and we have seen that time and time again . fuck that .
10915,just the fact they they know they are fuked ...
10916,ruck fussia . genocidal evil .
10917,lmao shut up and die rapists
10918,russia is a terrorist state .
10919,"the guys who are encircled are unable to choose not to obey the dictator , so i reckon the ukrainians should choose their fate for them"
10920,"grant them , and then shell it when the troops retreat ."
10921,"pfft , provide a green corridor the russian way and take them all pow . take all the gear , vehicles , armor ."
10922,green corridors are for civilian evacuation . not so troops can change position and escape encirclement . pound them into dust with artillery and force them to surrender . exchange them for azovstal fighters .
10923,no . next unreasonable demand for ukraine to refuse please .
10924,"it would be stupid to agree to this request . they can die fighting or surrender . during a war , you don't let encircled enemy troops retreat only to have them fight you again . it's simply not logic ."
10925,give no quarter to the monsters
10926,"they absolutely should agree , there's no need to deny them safe passage out of their position . sucks they evacuated right through an area conducting live fire drills that day though , awful tragic"
10927,just like that green corridor given to the folks in mariupol ammiright ?
10928,i thought green corridors were for civilians .
10929,"green corridors are for civilians to escape a war zone . these are soldiers . take them as prisoners of war and treat them in accordance with the geneva convention . or if they won't surrender , bayraktar + himars = problem solved"
10930,"no is a complete sentence and the appropriate answer in this case . you fuckers invaded , now lay down your arms and surrender...or don't . your choice ."
10931,"realistically what the ukrainians should do is mimic russian behaviour , seeing as that's what the russians want to see "" they shouldn't try and be western , they should be like us "". so , this said , the ukranians should agree to a green corridor today and then fucking smash the fuck out of the corridor with everything they've got ; just like the russians did to all the civilian evacuation corridors in the past and to odessa yesterday ( not even 24 hours after agreeing to leave it alone in order for grain to be exported to the starving southern hemisphere ). russia can fuck off . slava ukraini ! "
10932,"source : [ "" he added that the russians , according to \* unconfirmed \* data , asked at the tactical level for a "" green corridor "" to get out of the encirclement . basically , another bullshit clickbait ."
10933,"unless these troops have been rotated they are same shitty people who invaded , the least they deserve is a long prison sentence ."
10934,this still seems to be based on the unconfirmed rumors from yesterday ?
10935,"give them and then bomb them to he'll , just as the russian do whatever deal they made or announced . just treat the russian the same way .."
10936,russia wouldn't allow a humanitarian corridor for civilian evacuation without shelling it
10937,a well fertilised green corridor .
10938,same ' green corridor ' like ruzzians have done in ilovaisk
10939,either surrender or become a basis for the largest sunflower field in ukraine .
10940,special opperations still goin as planned .
10941,if the nazzis surrender and then exchanged they will soon be back in the fight again !! make sure they are all injured ...
10942,no fuck off . turn it into villers bocage or the road to basra .
10943,"fuck no , blow the fuckin lot up ."
10944,this is very elaborate but hear me out . put the pows to clean the streets of the cities . feed them and house them . let them tell the families what city they are in and watch the russian missiles kill their ownsoldiers
10945,i enjoyed this article . lots of potential shit happening for the invaders . i truly hope it's all becoming reality .
10946,i didn't know russian weed was this strong . they are smoking some good stuff there .
10947,whole world telling them to leave for 150 days . you chose not to . get fucked russians
10948,"it's war . these are combatants . the whole idea is to surround and either capture or kill the enemy . what is this talk of a "" green corridor "" for soldiers ?"
10949,after bombing odesa ?? give them nothing !
10950,"has an attacking army ever asked fort a ' green corridor '? how does that thought process even work ? i get trading of pow's , but this ? * oopsie , we over extended ourselves and got surrounded . would you guys be so nice to let us walk / drive back , preferably with our weapons and supplies ?*"
10951,"lol , um no . either surrender or be kia , the choice is up to them"
10952,nope . what a great victory for ukrainians .
10953,remember that it is extremely important from a strategic perspective to allow enemy combatants to surrender and to treat pows humanely . show the russians that they have to choose between meaningless death in privation and squalor or relative comfort in captivity . much easier fight and quicker collapse that way .
10954,"there is no such thing as a "" green corridor "" to evacuate invading troops who wants to fight somewhere else ."
10955,fuck those russian fucks !
10956,sure ! but you get them back without heads if they did not surrender .
10957,how the tables have turned . rescue them with fire and brimstone i say .
10958,absolutely no way . no mercy for russia . starve them out of ammunition and food and continue with the counter offensive .
10959,"from what you done so far in mariupol , i have to say no . no green corridors for you . either become pows or die , ther are only your choices . choose it wisely ."
10960,they can't be serious . is this another troll from russia similar to taking alaska back ?
10961,"moral high ground or pragmatic realism ? i take pragmatic realism . either they surrender at a given point at a given time with "" un observers "" present , or it's open season on orcs ."
10962,i understand they just signed an agreement to let the grain flow . but until we see how that pans out its hard to think russia is acting in any good faith . especially after the mariupol its not exactly something ukraine would agree to . especially since it is just combatants encircled
10963,ask for all citizens to be returned
10964,"ok , i'll do it this time : what's ligma ?"
10965,"even if they did it just isn't comparable . ukraine has asked for green corridors for civilians to escape the war , russia is making the ridiculous request to allow its invading soldiers to reposition for another attack ."
10966,"during the post-2014 donbass conflict , russia was happy to provide green corridors...which they famously violated almost immediately each time to massacre ukrainian soldiers . they should get no such consideration now ."
10967,russia agreed to humanitarian corridors and then shelled civilians evacuating on numerous occasions .
10968,"ukraine will never agree to this . we are not surprised about port incident . that's why ukraine signed that deal with un and turkey , not russia . the only green corridor orcs can get is to lay down their weapon and go into ukrainian captivity ."
10969,the article itself said they denied the request for a corridor . it's ride or die for ruzzia now .
10970,did they not shoot all of the civilian corridors ? reap what you sow . such wow .
10971,maybe they thought putlers cancer was making him more human somehow and he was suddenly trustworthy .
10972,i agree . let anyone who wants to surrender do so and kill the rest . russia doesn't deserve anything better after azovstal .
10973,19 hours it took them to break that agreement . fuck them all !
10974,"remember years ago when the russian army executed a column of ukrainian troops using a "" humanitarian corridor "" to leave the town of ilovaisk , which was under siege , later dubbed as the "" ilovaisk pocket ..."" not to mention all the other atrocities these shit bags have committed against the ukrainian people as of late ? yeah . i do . fuck these russians . they do not deserve to invade , destroy , kill , rape & pillage and then ask for "" compassion "" when they get cut off from the protection of their main mob . the earth is better off without these animals on the planet . fuck . them ."
10975,i think usa has a leverage to agree to this deal . ukraine needs more himers . but pows is better than green corridor .. and also they should loose the equipments .
10976,"> ukraine would be stupid to agree to this .. this is such good news . i think in terms of corridors , we can all trust that zelenskyy will provide them a nice "" pow corridor ."""
10977,this is the correct answer .
10978,maybe they should reply : russian invader : go fuck yourself .
10979,""" we'll provide a corridor for them to leave as soon as they surrender and give us all their arms and equipment ."""
10980,"hey , our troops were there to wreak havoc on your people and economy , but now that theyve been surround , you think you could provide them safe passage home so they can rest up and re engage? "
10981,give them a green coridor trough a mine field..de-mining and de-nazifying at the same time..also fertilizing the soil so three birds with one stone
10982,ukraine could use those prisoners of war to get back some of their people fuck russia .
10983,had to scroll too far for this
10984,... then turn it red .
10985,give them a mined corridor . straight up home alone that shit .
10986,russia is not a member or signatory .
10987,the hague is about as useful as nipples on the batsuit .
10988,"it's like "" hey can we get our shit out so that we can attack on another front ?"" uh ... no ?"
10989,"agreed . at least those russian soldiers can be sure that they won't be tortured and deported to siberia if they are captured , unlike the ukrainian pows captured by the orcs ."
10990,didnt the russian filth just bomb the grain docks after agreeing to allow grain to be moved again ? yeah f them ! nevermind the russians have a history of agreeing to green corridors and then firing a few missiles into them . the russians deserve nothing .
10991,"just a reminder for those who didn't know or forgot : when ukraine asked russia for a green corridor in illovaysk , russia said of course and then proceeded with massacring the withdrawing ukrainian troops . so i'd say fuck ' em ."
10992,"yeah , evacuate them with missiles ... from life"
10993,they should trade them for azovstal prisoners
10994,of yeah give them a green corridor . it's a green because they'll become natural fertilizer for the sunflowers .
10995,"only way out of ukraine prison should be return of all mariupol steel factory prisoners . nothing else , absolutely zero other ways out of being a pow ."
10996,"kia for all of them , fucking child rapists deserve to suffer and burn in hell"
10997,"agreed - no green corridor to allow the russian filth to fight another day . but would prefer they become pows instead of kia . save the ukrainian personnel and ammo to fight other russians . beyond the benefit of a pow swap , sending back a bunch of humiliated and demoralized russians home will help speed up the public backlash to putin's war ."
10998,"roll in with some tos-1 and thermobaric missiles , treat them to the same russian goodbye gifts it gave every evacuation and green corridor for ukrainians leaving mariupol ."
10999,"i doubt they would be kias ( ukraine doesn't kill surrounded hostile forces , even pieces of shit like these ), but i hope they'd become pows . we have to play humanly , yes , but not letting them ~~ be evacuated ~~ go ."
11000,after breaking a deal not to bomb odessa and now they want to make a deal ? lol
11001,pow's only on the understanding that they undertake de-mining duties until any prisoner exchanges take place .
11002,time to turn on the delete this grid feature for himars/m270 .
11003,and hundreds of thousands of kidnapped ukrainians .
11004,this is the one .
11005,and the people the shipped to russia and the children they have stolen and given to russian families .
11006,"azov wasn't the only ones at azovstal , most were border guards and marines"
11007,"dont know why , but what happened at mariupol with the azov made me extremely upset and pissed off with the shit deal they gave them . its weird cause im american and some how what happened really got at me to my core"
11008,return azov soldiers and get out of kherson !
11009,you don't trade war criminals for hostages .
11010,"yeah bring azov home no matter what . if there is no deal , unleash hell"
11011,> those bastards that thinks agreements are only for them and it's ok to ignore any other ones they make . they made one ( with ukraine and turkey ) to allow ukraine to transport grain and fired kalibr missiles at the port in odessa .
11012,"same boat . there are other things i want to say , but they are fueled by what russia made me become . which i hate them and myself for . fuck that entire country . worthless ."
11013,or even the civilians .
11014,"out of kherson , but towards a pow camp in ukr ."
11015,or the massacre of ilovaisk in 2014
11016,free ticket out of europe !
11017,** russian commanders :** we were just playin ' this time the artillery shells were a total accident .. *.. now could you let our troops and equipment leave so we can backsta .. uhh fight you next week ? .. nevermind i meant go home .. that is what i really meant .. come on !*
11018,azov swap or nothing
11019,take the buses to chernobyl to clean up the radiation there 
11020,yes . exactly like civilian evacuation corridors into russia for ukrainian people at the start of the invasion . sons of bitches . motherfuckers .
11021,no - one straight to hell
11022,"always have been edit : i should clarify , nazis were never good , they were terrible , but the russians have always been just as bad if not worse , both are a cancer on society ."
11023,"nazis are in the museum , ruzzians are the real threat now ."
11024,preferably both .
11025,"they ask precisely because the answer will be used to support their "" they are nazis "" propaganda . my guess is they also have orders to not surrender , possibly with threats to their families at home , so the propaganda can claim there was a massacre ."
11026,"good idea , but better as pow if we can get back other ukrainians that have been taken prison by pigland ."
11027,im completely enraged these audacious pricks would ask for green corridors given the fact they were constantly attacking them . never mind the fact that they invaded ukraine . i hope theyre all cargo 200 or pows in the near future . fuck every last one of them .
11028,"if they do it right , ukraine could turn this into a pr coup that shatters russian enlisted and junior officer morale even more than it already has been ."
11029,the blood of the enemy ! why is the sky blue ?
11030,russian style .
11031,"i do wonder why they are even asking , something feels a bit suspicious . hopefully after the denial/bombing putin wont escalate his "" special military operation "" into a war which would allow him to access 250,000 reserve troops ."
11032,"you don't make deals with the devil . all is fair in love and war , which means russia will probably use it as a way to execute another unjust strategy ."
11033,reddit loves misinformation
11034,"hell , they'd shoot up a bus filled with evacuating children if they got a clear shot ."
11035,fosfoorous ammo .
11036,thank you for your service . o7
11037,"orcs , ligma balls ."
11038,"you're right , thanks for the addition to my comment ."
11039,there is no need for a corridor for troops to retreat . they need to surrender and be taken prisoner . it's not complicated .
11040,"the bomb civilian green corridors , they bomb ports after signing agreements not to ... fuck them and the machinery they rode in on ."
11041,"they know they won't allow it , they just want to be able to turn around and say "" see ? look how brutal they are ! they deserve this !"""
11042,1000 %!! exactly that !!
11043,"1 ) plant airtags on them ; 2 ) track them to russian army ; 3 ) nuke it from orbit , it's the only way to be sure ."
11044,they should agree and then bomb that corridor specifically to take out as many soldiers as possible . im so tired of this whole dont stoop down to their level bullshit . look at what theyre fucking doing to ukraine and the world . theyre causing terror and starvation . every move against them would be justified .
11045,"not just 2014 donbass . they constantly did this in syria too , as with every other conflict they've been involved in in recent history . it's just how they are ."
11046,wasn't that the infamous avdeevka mechanized brigade that got absolutely massacred you're mentioning ? edit : not avdeevka but ilovaisk
11047,they did literally that with civilians in mariupol in the early days .
11048,i'd say give them the green lane but himars them once they get into the range . their movement should be monitored right ?
11049,"but they forgot one detail .. putin doesn't have cancer , he is cancer ."
11050,id rather have tea with a sith
11051,"don't forget , the corridor goes directly to a ukrainian pow camp deeper in the country . turnabout is fair play . pows are useful for prisoner trades among other things ."
11052,did you just make war green ?
11053,give them sunflower seeds for their pockets .
11054,"i've watched the interview of a ukrainian farmer - bodies decomposition produces a lot of nitrogen , bodies alone are not a good fertilizer in year 1 , so the poor farmers on the north of ukraine had to walk thier fields and gather russian remains into the body bags . even the wildlife does not eat them properly ..."
11055,"there is one critical flaw in your logic . you let them go , you lose the leverage , and then there is an absolute 0 % chance they'll hold on to their word if they even agree to that in the first place ."
11056,you never win with a bully who inly understands force unless you use force back
11057,"the icc prosecutes individuals , not countries . a country doesnt need to be a signatory for them to prosecute a member of that countrys military , would be a pretty bad incentive to be a signatory if that was the case . being a signatory is just a commitment to making sure their soldiers obey the laws of war so that there wouldnt be those individuals getting prosecuted ."
11058,was serbia ? is that even how it works ? teach me plz .
11059,"uh , then russia should not agree to allow the grain out and then russia should own up to it being the cause of famine . but , whatever . russia is getting beat in ukraine , its economy is collapsing , and it is about to become balkanized so it is all good !"
11060,yeah and if weve learned anythin from the past we probably wont see those ukrainian pows for 5-10 years after the war * if * we even see them again . fuck russia and especially fuck putin
11061,"deported is also possibly death . russia has been taking away passports , money , phones , etc from the ' deported ', and many who may have been deported haven't called family in ukraine : which you think would be amongst the first things you would do when you arrive in siberia . deported may well be a russian euphemism for genocide ."
11062,"> didnt the russian filth just bomb the grain docks after agreeing to allow grain to be moved again ? yes , yes they did ."
11063,yup
11064,"no , save the russian's with missiles"
11065,evacuate their bowels .
11066,give them the same circumstances and conditions offered to the azovstal defenders . after capitulation call for prisoner transfers . what is good for the goose is good for the gander .
11067,azovstal heroes . they fought a 21rst century thermopylae . and should be remembered as are the 300 spartans and their allies .
11068,can't be any more green ! only natural fertilizer is being used .
11069,even hell has standards higher than these fuckers
11070,there is also the benefit of russian pows telling the truth to their friends and family back home .
11071,"b52 carpet bombing seems inorder - i know it is unrealistic but it seems appropriate or just let them starve , have their own private hunger games"
11072,if they refuse to surrender then they are a legitimate target to be destroyed .
11073,they need pows to exchange for those azovstal soldiers .
11074,"they cant afford to keep em . food is a scarce resource in war . besides ukrainian people have a heart , and they are not war criminals , unlike some "
11075,the deal should be - surrender and be treated humanely as pows .
11076,excellent idea .
11077,that sounds fair .
11078,"that one is illegal . just capture them for prisoner exchange . announce the exchange to the russians in kherson and let them surrender , get your guys back ."
11079,"can't let 3,000 plus ra back in the fight . they must be forced to surrender or be annihilated !"
11080,"same here . i was keeping up with mariupol everyday since the war began . i was relieved they werent stuck there low on resources of food and water and ammo , but i was saddened they are pows now and may experience worse now ."
11081,because you my friend are a human being who cared about innocent lives . nationality doesn't matter when one suffers
11082,i frankly think they did ukraine a favor taking out the azov battalion considering the fact they were literal nazis even if they happened to fight for a cause which was ultimately good
11083,"yes , azov has been killing russian nazis , what else is new ?"
11084,"they also provided "" green corridors "" to ukrainians many times only to shoot at the people using them . they either intentionally break these agreements , or they have such poor control of their troops that the agreements are pointless . i might have bought the latter , but i highly doubt stuff like launching cruise missiles at odessa can happen without orders from high command ."
11085,"not the whole country man , just putin and the oligarchs . the people of russia are usually pretty cool ime . many of them agree with the war and thats despicable , but theyve been fed lies upon lies ."
11086,a goodwill gesture .
11087,"or the ceasefire on grain-ports they agreed to this week , and then immediately bombarded the moment the grain showed up ."
11088,"fuck "" innocence "". this is war ."
11089,no . what russians did is horrible . actual corridors to pow camps and then exchange . there is no reason to stoop to russian level .
11090,"not really . always capture if you can . first of all because we are human and not russians . second , you can exchange them to get your people back . third russia does not care about lives of their soldiers and would actually prefer them to die then to go back to russia and spread the truth . fourth , it\`s much more embarrassing for russia and demoralizing for the russian army if they get captured ."
11091,the ruzzians were nazis before the nazis were even a thing
11092,"russian revisionists ( or probably troll farms ) have been trying to argue that the ussr should be credited with winning ww2 while conveniently forgetting that 1 ) they made a pact with leopard and didn't join the allies until after the leopard ate their face , and 2 ) they had their own extermination camps leading up to , during , and after the war ."
11093,because ukraine is not russia .
11094,"civilised countries would immediately work as hard as possible to get soldiers back , unfortunately pigland is not one of those . soldiers are just meat bags with a weapon ( if you are lucky ), i don't know how many pow exchanges have been led successfully but i don't trust those animals ... with all respect for animals . i fear that this could be used by ruzzians as a mean to show to the world that ukrainians don't let encircled soldiers escape , no matter what they did with the azov soldiers in the factory . ruzzians can throw rock and break a window in front of thousands of people and blame the guy next to them . unfortunately they will never give the azov battalion soldiers back to us , their value is too high for them no matter how many younglings from the most unknown pigland regions have been imprisoned . you are obviously right , pow exchange would be the best option but i don't trust ruzzians ... we could hope in their need for soldiers cause of the fear for mass mobilisation ."
11095,"ps : anyway , since we are not dog's shit like them , nothing stops us from taking care of the few surviving pigs after the mass bombing i hope and exchange them once healed . we can exchange them , maybe they will have few limbs missing and bodies like groviera cheese cause of bomb shards but that's a detail . it could take more time but unfortunately those rats are numerous"
11096,"can't have those russians romanov , no corridor !"
11097,"man , i fuckin love reddit . top tier comment . lmao"
11098,my only regret is that more people wont see this masterpiece of a comment .
11099,"> ligma some context ( for people like me "" not in the loop "") why this is pretty bloody good "" ligma is a made-up disease and internet hoax claimed to have killed popular fortnite video game streamer ninja . when people not in on the joke ask "" what is ligma ?"" pranksters reply with the crass pun "" ligma ( lick my ) balls "" or other such slang term , like nuts . where does ligma come from ? ligma spread as a joke in may 2018 ."""
11100,noice got me to chuckle
11101,what a wonderful comment
11102,mao gotem
11103,foooking rekt m8
11104,"good for them . ukraine should be brutal . russia has given no consideration and no mercy for soldier or civilian at any turn . they won't start doing so if the ukrainians show them kindness , and there's nothing else to gain by letting them have their way , so starve the bastards . to quote a great general ; "" no terms except an unconditional and immediate surrender can be accepted . i propose to move immediately upon your works ."""
11105,"yeah , probably looking for false equivalence . if pushed i'd have to acknowledge that if i were a russian general i wouldn't be keen on offering green corridors to the ukrainians either . its all well saying its just for civilians , but how exactly can they be sure that ukrainian fighters aren't hiding amongst those evacuating ."
11106,"> every move against them would be justified . morally , yeah probably . but strategically its probably a bad idea . if this becomes a conflict between two evils then western support won't be as strong . secondly , they only get to do that trick once and killing a few thousand soldiers doesn't seem worth it . they'll win the war far faster once russians start surrendering in huge numbers , that's most likely to happen if they know they'll be treated well despite their crimes ."
11107,basically lying violent backstabbing cunts . take them prisoner and exchange them for azov soldiers .
11108,i really fucking hate russians . and i'm russian .
11109,"russia didn't do this , it was ukraine killing their own troops ! putin said so himself ! / s"
11110,"the worst one was [ battle of ilovaisk ]( russians agreed to a green corridor then massacred 500-1000 retreating ukrainian troops . edit : and when i say russians i literally mean the russian army included along with the proxy terrorists , ukraine captured serving members of the russian military from various units during the battle ."
11111,it would also be a war crime under the geneva convention . no need to stoop to russias level . ukraine is setting the example of legal warfare to every despot and dictator out there .
11112,"there's no need for that . just deny russia the request and force them to either surrender or die . i was watching a video yesterday about a guy that couldn't make it as a pro boxer . so he started going to fitness gyms and asking people to do some "" light sparring "". after they agreed , he'd go full-blast and basically beat up innocent gym goers and claim it as a win for his record . whenever anyone could actually fight back he'd immediately call for a "" time out "" and then use that as an excuse to sucker-punch them . what that guy was doing is basically how russia operates , but on a national scale ."
11113,"1 . no , ukraine is better than that 2 . it would break the geneva convention ( who's gonna enforce it no one enforces it on russia...next point . 3 . usa and eu would stop or slow sending weapons used in war crimes . they can just refuse , and then bomb them till surrender , and not break agreements ."
11114,"would be funny , but i dont think its in ukraines interest to stoop down the their level . just leave them in their shitty position to rot . tbh im starting to feel bad for the invaders who are given no training and then are ordered to hold way too deep of a position only to get surrounded lol ."
11115,just because russia is committing war crimes and genocide that doesn't mean ukraine should start .
11116,cancer has putin . i feel sorry for the cancer . imagine having to spread slowly throughout such a vile depraved unhinged man . its disgusting .
11117,cancer has putin .
11118,i guess i did :)
11119,war is always green ; it's just not environmentally friendly .
11120,nothing greener than setting off land mines lmao
11121,"maybe , they just need to be exploded into smaller pieces and cover a greater area . modern solutions to modern problems ."
11122,"you do realize that russia promised to allow the grain out , then bombed the port they said they wouldn't bomb less than 24 hours later , right ? not having a agreement on grain really seems exactly the same as having one ."
11123,its actually simply a part of genocide . they intend to resettle the areas with ethnic ruzzians .
11124,"as much as i'd love to have a lot of dead ruzis , i think i'd rather have pows to trade for ukrainian pows (& fucking abducted civilians !). save the ammo for other piece-of-shit ruzis , like the entire ruzi navy"
11125,"just because russia doesnt stand to its word doesnt mean we suddenly dont have to stand to ours . thats the difference , right ? we still are decent , even if they are not . we dont bomb civilians , even if they do , because its wrong and we are trying to do the right thing . just because russians dont have morals doesnt mean we can forget ours . because if we do , we are not better than them . and then we already lost ."

11130,"the typical blast wave of a thermobaric weapon lasts significantly longer than that of a conventional explosive . a human rights watch report of 1 february 2000 quotes a study made by the us defense intelligence agency : > the [ blast ] kill mechanism against living targets is uniqueand unpleasant . ... what kills is the pressure wave , and more importantly , the subsequent rarefaction [ vacuum ], which ruptures the lungs . ... if the fuel deflagrates but does not detonate , victims will be severely burned and will probably also inhale the burning fuel . since the most common fae fuels , ethylene oxide and propylene oxide , are highly toxic , undetonated fae should prove as lethal to personnel caught within the cloud as with most chemical agents . > another defense intelligence agency document speculates that , because the "" shock and pressure waves cause minimal damage to brain tissue ... it is possible that victims of faes are not rendered unconscious by the blast , but instead suffer for several seconds or minutes while they suffocate "" i suggested the tos-1 for * very * specific reasons ."
11131,yup . surrender or learn why himars and its cousins are considered grid-square erasures .
11132,as much as i detest killing you are right . if they don't surrender and continue to try and kill ukrainians the ukrainians are absolutely in the right to try and kill them back .
11133,i vote for annihilation .
11134,annihilate them wouldn't make uaf any better . don't go down that road .
11135,i guess there were too many wounded both soldiers and civilians with no means to get treatment without surrendering . we still don't know what terms of the surrender were . i hope those terms were more solid than that poor grain deal .
11136,nothing in the russian military happens unless at least 3 mid-ranking officers are presiding over the actions . these terrorist attacks are systemic and warrant nothing short of the complete destruction of the russian military as a fighting force .
11137,green as in carpeted with the bodies of little green men .
11138,"i wasn't stooping to their level , just saying what disgusting motherfuckers they are . ruskys must go to prison and let their equipment be captured for a bonus ."
11139,fifth to encourage others to surrender
11140,"four very good points . you should be a peace ambassador . i do feel sorry for ruzzian teenagers who are trying to impress daddy by signing up to the army then five days later , without adequate training in anything , they find themselves killing people ."
11141,pogroms have re-entered the lexicon
11142,"also that they won because the germans had a lot of their resources and men occupied fighting on two other fronts in western europe and the mediterranean and the american lend lease program was supplying them with the means to actually gain any ground . it was a group effort and just because russia lost the most men doesn't mean they won it all or that we would have lost without them . without all that help and in a true 1v1 at the time , germany would have easily steamrolled russia and marched on moscow much like they did to paris/france and probably in only a slightly longer time frame . even with all those earlier factors i mentioned they still got to within 10 miles of moscow by november . quantity is the only quality that the russian military has ."
11143,fair point .
11144,the ruzzians would likely send any ukrainian pow soldiers back with a packed lunch of novachok nacos . dont eat their food guys !
11145,"the russian forces are more likely to surrender compared to higher ups . it's pretty clear that at the end of the day , their military is very sloppy . they would either die ignorant or surrender ."
11146,it would need to be a 1:1 exchange and include every single mariupol defender
11147,turkey has run some decent exchanges
11148,"you've just witnessed the archbishop of banterbury at work . high grade banter is a beautiful thing . source : am british , fluent in banter"
11149,what makes this comment so good ? what context does one need in order to appreciate this ?
11150,morally it could even be a bit ambitious . remember that countries and militaries are not actually one being with one mind .
11151,so profound and well said
11152,they don't deserve to be taken prisoner .
11153,give them some brain damaging drug first . make them like children .
11154,why azov specifically ?
11155,"exactly the one i meant , thanks . i remember watching a documentary about some battalions in avdeevka and the battle for the donetsk airport region , and that massacre got mentioned but now that i see the name i remember it again ."
11156,fucking animals .
11157,they'd be way more valuable as pows . exchange soldiers and interrogate officers .
11158,not to mention a propaganda win for russia . it'd probably be best to send those russians back with their tails between their legs to tell fellow aggressors that ukrainians haven't given up and are coming back for their land .
11159,are you sure ?
11160,seen the video of that guy . total scumbag .
11161,then got rocked by a 16 year old who had seen his videos and knew to anticipate it .
11162,"yep . let's take it to its logical conclusion from the perspective of a decision-maker in the pentagon . if ukraine proves it won't fulfill international obligations , then it's reasonable to assume ukraine won't fulfill other promises . if there's a reasonable chance that ukraine won't stick to promises , then there's a non-insignificant chance that ukraine would use long range himars missiles to strike deep into russian territory against our wishes . the us would stop providing long-range missiles in any meaningful numbers . that would then kill the trend of the slow but steady american ramping up of providing more and more advanced weaponry . lets explore what that means . the us started this war absolutely and explicitly ruling out giving jets to ukrainians as they were seen as offensive weapons ... now , congress [ approved ukrainian pilots to start learning how to pilot f-15s and f-16s ]( and the pentagon is actually [ debating whether we can send those jets directly from us .]( to put into context how radical that is , turkey - a nato ally member for 70 years - is just now approved to be sold f-15s/16s after [ playing hardball with sweden and finland application negotiations .]( and this is just for the us . think about how many european/canadian allies who are * very * sensitive to international law and diplomacy . the point being the millisecond ukraine goofs up the way russia has , the western-supported ukrainian rejuvenation project will be in question . there are very real , material , and practical reasons why ukrainians should think twice about deliberately violating international law . i'd go so far as to say any ukrainian national being found breaking said international law should be condemned and punished swiftly and publically by the ukrainian authorities ."
11163,"there are ways for them to not participate in war . however there are reports about "" jails "" on occupied territories for soldiers who don't want to fight . ( article is on russian , but check few leaked photos )"
11164,"if we're lucky , when serious counteroffensives start vlad will give some kind of "" not a step backwards "" order . those are terrible for morale and cause high , wasteful casualties ."
11165,thats probably how hes lasted this long . hes so toxic he basically has built in chemo to kill the cancer
11166,"that's what i was thinking . imagine the doctor , having to break it to the cancer , that is got putin . fuck putin"
11167,contracts mean nothing to russians
11168,"not only that , the ruzzian pows should be allowed , if not encouraged to call friends and family back in ruzzia and tell them whats going on ."
11169,"yup . capture them all , force them to watch all of the massacres they've been commiting , ever last second of recorded data . then let them call home . and then trade them off ."
11170,"a gander for a gander leaves the whole world gooseless . so ... yeah , do it ."
11171,sorrry for my ignorance - what is a grid-square erasure ?
11172,they seem to really like rape .
11173,"if they refuse to surrender then it's simply combat loss , there's no moral dubiousness here . there's no reason ukraine should allow enemy forces to retreat , with arms , through their territory , just because the enemy asked nicely if they could . especially so when their elimitation as active combatants would improve ukraine's odds in the conflict . these aren't geneva-protected non-combatants , these are hostile forces . in war , if you get encircled , you fight and ( likely ) die , or you surrender and become a pow . that's how war works , there are no kindnesses when lives are on the line ."
11174,this is war and the ra and its leadership are inhuman scum who will rape children . two options and only two . mo
11175,"if the orcs don't want to be annihilated , they could use those white strips of cloth they use to decorate themselves , tie it on a stick and and wave it as a white flag of surrender ."
11176,disgusting they indeed are .
11177,"indeed yes . most russian soldiers do not want to be there . they are from poor areas and are being used as canon fodder . if they surrender , get treated properly and go back home , most of the others will take that opportunity ."
11178,russia will feel the consequences of this war for decades . all those teenagers that you speak of will have severe mental issues when and if they come back . with no mental help in russia they will turn their society into an even worse shithole .
11179,"this , not many people know about this , tankies claim it's all western propaganda , i can't believe people don't know what russia has done historically"
11180,"something like 70 % of german casualties happened on the eastern front fighting the ussr . the only reason d-day was a success was that the overwhelming majority of german forces were on the eastern front . the allies helped the soviets for sure , but the soviets were by far the more important and impactful enemy for the germans ."
11181,"you need reddit language context . kinda an artform in its own right . like socially constructed poetry , sometimes . possibly limerick in form , occasionally allegorical , sometimes simile gone awry . typically there's no meter , nor rhythm . usually pun-tifical . always reddit ."
11182,"i could but wrong , but i think it is a play on the word ... spoiler : >! romanov aka romanoff which sounds similar to "" roaming off ""!<"
11183,dont worry fam im slow too . i googled it all before o got it . im pretty sure its a play on lick my ball sack .
11184,this is insulting to children
11185,done
11186,animals are better then that .
11187,"10 % back , 90 % for exchange leverage"
11188,"it appears so , yes , technically it is a war crime . > when carried out in order to commit or resume hostilities , the feigning of a cease-fire [ was considered as perfidy ]( geneva convention , article 37 , prohibition of perfidy : > it is prohibited to kill , injure or capture an adversary by resort to perfidy . acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to , or is obliged to accord , protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict , with intent to betray that confidence , shall constitute perfidy ."
11189,yeah the bulk of the russian army has more value as fertilizer
11190,loved the beatdown he gets at the end .
11191,could you link it ?
11192,exactly right . [ even npr ]( is starting to bring up ukrainian corruption that could threaten further aid from the us . they can't be idiots and get into the mud with the invading horde .
11193,"uh , turkey has been domestically producing the f-16 for decades"
11194,"putin is so undesirable he makes anus pus look like an attractive condiment . there is nothing more unattractive than vladimir putin . i think he will end up on time magazine cover as the human with the most punchable face . im not a sadistic man but id make an exception to slowly kill this germ by slowly carving him up with a razor blade , millimetre by millimetre . cant wait to see his decapitated head and i hope they leave his body somewhere for people to travel to a shit on his face . fucking scumbag ."
11195,"words mean to them , almost inhuman , orcs is a fitting terminology"
11196,thus trump's comfort with russians .
11197,"draw a grid , click button , everything in the grid is gone"
11198,super annihilation then
11199,"yes good treatment might make them unable to hate or kill their good captors again and encourage the other young scared little guys to get themselves caught as a pow too , then therell be rash of them surrendering . then we will have peace on earth and goodwill amongst all mankind as all the baby orcs will have returned from their ordeal and have been transformed from the dark side to the light ( i know im dreaming ). they will probably go back to their crack pipes and vodka again though with a tall war tale to tell the grandchildren later ."
11200,"they weren't though . just because that's where the majority of german casualties happened doesn't mean that's where the majority of their troops were . they had around the same number of troops or more on the western front for much of the war . and hundreds of thousands more fighting across the mediterranean in africa , italy , greece , etc . and you have to remember that much of those casualties were inflicted later on in the war because they were able to just barely hold it together through operation barbarossa in the first place . they were outkilled almost 5:1 in that time . germany was absolutely shitcanning them with less than half of their military . yes they started running low on troops and got bogged down in the russian winter and eventually slowly repelled , but that's overwhelmingly because the other two fronts of the war and american lend-lease policy saved the soviets asses ."
11201,no one is downplaying russian contributions or losses ; but the ussr got in bed with hitler by signing a non aggression pact and dividing poland with germany ; sat out the war as western europe fell in 1940 ; and got burned for it in 1941 when no one else was on the european mainland to aid them . you say d-day was successful because the majority of the german forces were in russia but keep in mind - churchill declining hitler's armistice proposal kept a large portion of the luftwaffe and rommel's expeditionary troops out of the eastern front . as i stated above - the leopard ate russia's face and that's what led to their high casualty rate .
11202,the word you are looking for is orc. 
11203,"no , are you sure that firing on an unsurrendered enemy is a war crime ? it's a dick move , but i'm not sure if there's anything in the geneva convention about that ."
11204,"charlie zelenoff . i just found it by searching from what people have said here , this guy is clearly an epic pos . number 4 is where the 16 year old kicks the shit out of him . the fact this guy is even willing to show face in public is pretty amazing ."
11205,"it's behind in a lot of important categories ( i think after russia , transparency international had them ranked as the second most corrupt european country ). i was just reading an article from the economist where there's a growing inappetite in the west to give out loans or aid to developing countries as so much of it is funneled into corrupt officials and or chinese creditors . ukraine is going to really need to tred the line ( which i feel they've done so , btw , i'm not being critical just fair ). even the militarily-celebrated poland has had some eu funding yanked because of their anti-democratic slide pre-war . point is ukrainians need to keep their noses clean so they can keep receiving the aid i really want to them to receive ."
11206,oops . i mistook f-16 for modernization kits .
11207,"it's worth noting your comment "".. travel to take a shit on his face ."" isn't without precedent . after mussolini & his mistress were shot their bodies were dumped in a public square where they were abused by people - and it's recorded that this included people urinating in his mouth and bringing faeces and putting them on him . actually ' copping a squat ' on putin is a step further but hey we can only hope . :-)"
11208,of course not . but treating them well and then exchanging has the advanages that i described up there .
11209,"russians have also committed genocide because of race , shocking no one it was the ukrainians they were genociding . the holodomor killed millions of people in a deliberate attempt to destroy the growing ukrainian independence movement in the soviet union ."
11210,"the german troops on the western front were units from the eastern front sent west to recover and receive reinforcements and new equipment . if they were on the western front it's precisely because they were not deemed suited for more fighting on the eastern front , only suitable to guard a coast . the germans suffered more casualties in the first two months of barbarossa that they had suffered until that point in the war . the reason the germans were repelled is because of the soviets ' own accomplishment . the western front and the lend-lease helped , but not "" overwhelmingly "". no offense , but you should read an actual book about the eastern front . i can recommend when titans clashed if you want ."
11211,thanks mate !:)
11212,"dude , i like your academic approach . wed make a good team , youre smart and i can lift heavy things "
11213,fully agree .
11214,"fucking...yawn !! again . russian threats are like russian promises . worthless . russia still thinks it's relevant in today's world . like it's not a 3rd world nation with nuclear weapons . russia is like north korea , but with more , uninhabitable land . and putin is like a shorter , fatter kim jong-un , with a worse haircut ."
11215,idiots already caused a dooms day to ukraine . additional dooms day doesnt cary much weight when one is already in the middle of one .
11216,"oh , just fuck off russia . you threaten shit every day ."
11217,"another day , another worthless threat from russia . nobody is scared of you anymore boris !"
11218,"they won't have to attack crimea . after the collapse of the poorly trained and under equipped russian army , putins guards will have no choice but to give him the mussolini treatment . then the federation will break up and crimea along other naboring province will join ukraine and fast track to eu membership"
11219,the west needs to take the kid gloves off and let ruzzia have a taste of their own medicine .
11220,pretty laughable that the paper tiger has to make a threat to begin with . even more laughable the enormous mistakes this shit for brains of a country made deciding to go into ukraine to begin with .
11221,goalposts will be moved after crimea is retaken . has anyone been paying any attention the last few months ?
11222,"so let's get things clear ..... russia is currently trying to erase ukraine from the map , actively killing ukrainians by bullet and missle . now moscow is threatening to exterminate ukrainians if they resist being exterminated . russian logic is strange ."
11223,"another weekend , reading another russian nuclear threat . why hasn't anyone made a drinking game out of this yet ?"
11224,sure russia . now let's get you back to the nursing home .
11225,so......we have nothing to lose by just taking little pooty out now .
11226,ukraine attacking territory inside russia = perfectly ok ukraine attacking land taken by russia = doomsday ? alrighty then .
11227,what next ? will we blow up the universe ? steal all the red m&ms ?
11228,the russia and their gay clown leadership being cute again .
11229,russia making threats about ukraine attacking crimea means they basically admitted theyre terrified ukraine can take it back .
11230,i hope ukraine finds the best dramatic timing to retake crimea . too bad russias victory day or whatever of this year has already come and gone .
11231,"when russia uses forceful language , you know they are worried ."
11232,"oh , dear ! those russians sound so serious !"
11233,russia threatening a doomsday ? time for some more sanctions to be held in place until they completetly disarm .
11234,fuck yourself putler
11235,"nukes have one use and one use only . to use if someone lobs a nuke at you . anything else will make them a pariah forever , making nukes very expensive worthless ornaments in almost every situation ."
11236,oh no ! please dont use the nukes ! / s
11237,same ol sh1t
11238,"i think civilized media should better inform the rest of about 5 billion people in asia what fucking 130 millions of russkies have in store for them . no , really . this insane batshit must be well known ."
11239,bunch of drunks
11240,shrug
11241,so he is prepared to wipe out what supporters he has in crimea - cry me a river !
11242,if putin launched any type of nuke because he got embarresed . every single nuclear state will be aiming there's at miscow . the war crimes the raping the killing by incompetent russian sewer rats is getting old to the world leaders .
11243,"yes , we already knew losing crimea would be doomsday for russia . "
11244,when we knock at kremlin doors ? what can you escalate with then ?
11245,doubt
11246,who is this russia dude ? and why is he always screaming for attention like an abandoned child ? fucken damaged goods this kid is .
11247,"medvedev appears extremely weak with his messaging . it seems as though he realizes the distinct possibility of russia being forced out of crimea . it is unlikely the russian federation would want to let the russia people in crimea , they claim to be protecting , becoming expendable nuclear strike victims . the russian federation can not afford to have the position weakened any further in the international community by having a tantrum and using a tactile nuclear device ."
11248,new day new nuke threat from clowns
11249,once more - what's the benefit in spreading their statements ? there's no information in them . it's impossible to gauge if they mean it or not . the math of decisions should not take them into account and scaring the populus isn't going to help !
11250,russia can kiss the worlds ass . crimea is coming home .
11251,"time to start open season russia . just get on with it , fuck these vile pieces of shit ."
11252,"ukraine into nato and start attacking russia from all directions .... all neighbours just start taking land back .... georgia , finland , japan , china , usa divide belarus up , and take kalliningrad . there is something for everyone !!! simples"
11253,whatever you say russia
11254,they can hear the footsteps
11255,just let russia know if they use nukes on ukraine we will have to give ukraine a few nukes to use as they see fit .
11256,"go home , youre drunk little guy"
11257,all they have are threats . theyve used that for 50years to scare the west .
11258,learn a new song ! 
11259,let me guess . nukes ? again ?
11260,putin's arm must be getting tired from all the saber-rattling .
11261,yes it is a doomsday for putin as he roils her seen as a weak leader which would end him
11262,omg either shit or get off the pot for christ sake . so tired of empty threats .
11263,crimea belongs to the tartans and they wanted to stay with ukraine . thats my 5 cents .
11264,thank god it's doomsday !
11265,fuck ruzzia & bomb moscow . hey they started the war .
11266,"two things above all others ... declare putin and his regime ( fsb/gru ) terrorists ... 2 ... foment insurrection , revolution and chaos among the many minorities within russia . these people trapped in a horrible failed state deserve autonomy"
11267,"ok . the one where a lot of us die , and all of russia dies ? were all gonna die anyway . maybe a future without russia is best ."
11268,"and don't forget venezuela and nicaragua ..., parts of imperial russia ! "
11269,within five years russia will be 5 % of its current size . the restive republics will want their freedom and revenge .
11270,"same way it was going to be doomsday if anything was cut off kaliningrad , if sweden and finland joined nato , if heavy weapons were sent , if any weapons were sent ..."
11271,re-run -- i've seen this episode before .
11272,but crimea is ukraine
11273,and a doomsday it will be . russia will never recover .
11274,my morning coffee has no taste without these daily empty threats
11275,"they also said that they wouldn't attack odessa 2 days ago and attacked it 1 day ago . ukraine won't attack crimea anyway , they'll liberate it ."
11276,lets treat this threat like all the other doomsdays theyve threatened and not followed up on ignore .
11277,"if you attack your own country , we will be so mad ."
11278,* when the hunter become the hunted .*
11279,his own doomsday
11280,how many nuke threats ? have they heard of fallout ?
11281,"sounds like some people in russia are genuinely afraid that they could lose crimea . russia can take their threats and shove it , ukraine can take it's land back if it decides that's what it wants to do ."
11282,crimea is ukraine
11283,the last breath of a corrupt regime . everyone hates russia now .
11284,yaaaaaaawn
11285,lol the tables have really turned in this war
11286,is anyone keeping a list of all the threats . its got to be at least 1 per day ?
11287,oh go ahead and blow us up already .
11288,"grandpa is out in the yard yelling at clouds again . russia seems determined to commit suicide , and make themselves a laughingstock in the process . fucking just get on with it , and leave the adults alone ."
11289,"dooms day for russia , not us"
11290,shit or get off the pot .
11291,"another threat ? "" ohhhhhh dear ."" in my best piglett voice ."
11292,"christ theyve already said this a number of times . also , it will be months before ukraine can even launch a counteroffensive on crimea at all ."
11293,just because you stole something doesnt make it yours !
11294,stop ! or ill say stop again! 
11295,that's one of the problems .
11296,how did the doomsday respond to the threats ?
11297,russia is doomsday .
11298,did he mean shroomsday ?
11299,"we can attack , but u cant or we will cry rhetoric . fucking kindergarten levels of behaviour . these people are leading an entire nation , no wonder russia is so retarded"
11300,this is . great sign . russia wouldnt be making this threat id they werent worried about the way the war is going ! slavaukraini
11301,maybe stop calling it crimea and call it the part of ukraine stolen by russia in 2014 .
11302,again ? i thought they already said it
11303,"every world leader should sign a paper that reads in russian "" go fuck yourself "" then have it brought to putin"
11304,"what ? .... does he want to make a new entry in that old book ? ukraine will already have some "" dirty""-n-devices prepared for you .... stupid twat !"
11305,"im so tired of this , just do it already ."
11306,is dimitri aka the midget clown talking again out of his ass ? yadda yadda yadda china final last warning again and again and again
11307,thats a relief . it means nuclear weapons are not an option .
11308,"sure , k"
11309,"it's always a doomsday with russia . can't fight it out . can't win . we must "" doomsday "" them . like that will help russia . if they think the screws are turned on them now ? light a city up and find out the eu's and nato's resolve on this issue ."
11310,lol whatever they have stated that from day one doesnt mean that they can destroy moscow if they ever tried to do that dont play with fire fukers lol 
11311,fuck it . us humans had a good run . lets get it over with .
11312,how bout some talk of peace and de escalation ? commenters here should be ashamed . so ignorant and full of false bravado . i hope you get drafted so you can see the horrors nice and close .
11313,"if i had a follar for every time medvedev has threatened another country during this war , well id have about $ 129 , i reckon ."
11314,"calling russia a "" third world nation "" is quite ironic considering the context of where that term came from ."
11315,"john mccain said , "" ruzzia is a gas station masquerading as a country ."" "
11316,let's get ukraine into nato already and get them nukes so that we can end these threats .
11317,"i take this as good news . whenever russia gets super panicked and starts sabre rattling , then it means they know it's coming , and they can't do anything about it . russia is quite likely even more poorly capable of defending crimea than we thought ."
11318,"the reason why this threat is interesting is russia admits ukraine now has the momentum in this war . that's a big admission , even if only implicit ."
11319,exactly like north korea - also being used by china .
11320,"what hair ? he's mad , he's bald , he's pist ."
11321,north korea is probably pissed because the world takes their threats less seriously now that a supposed superpower has been sabre rattling for four months and literally no one gives a shit .
11322,take that back ! he is not as fat
11323,putin is fatter than kim ? i dont know man .
11324,"\> worthless so , do you claim there is no chance russia can use nukes on ukrainian forces ?"
11325,"as they say in brazil "" what is a fart , for someone who's shit themselves ?"""
11326,medvedev threatens the world with nuclear apocalypse every morning .
11327, this dude has the vibe .
11328,who's boris ?
11329,crimea will empty itself of putin associates . when the russian military collapses and they all race across that bridge - they'll be thrilled when they find out their russian passports won't get them into russia .
11330,> the russian federation needs to be utterly destroyed . this eventuality inches closer with every day . ukraine may well be the hill russia has chosen to die on .
11331,"no worries competition between ukraine and putin's army to destroy russian federation is a very close one . but i bet putin has already destroyed his land , mafia state , brainwashed pop , entire sectors of economy knocked out - car manufacturers - aviation - even mcdonald . gazprom and omon are the only employment prospects now ."
11332,a world without russia is a better and safer world .
11333,"amen to that , sir"
11334,then this title would come true and no one wants that
11335,no it's perfectly sane if you're a narcissistic sociopath .
11336,because we would all have alcohol poisoning if we made a drinking game of it .
11337,surely it * is * a drinking game in russia .
11338,dont you fkn touch my red m&ms !
11339,"all russian officials sound like gopniks in social media . medvedev who is a professional lawyer notoriously uses very silly gopnik language , phrasing and messaging , same goes for putin , lavrov , zakharova , military officials etc its like they all used one and the same gop speechwriter from the 7th grade ."
11340,nobody want that land back anymore - it stinks ...
11341,i'm saying send it . where's trump when you need him !
11342,... or a sizable down payment on a nice apartment by the red square .
11343,"hes not wrong about the doomsday though , doomsday for ruzzia to be clear ."
11344,"russia is capable , but they warn and do nothing . warn and do nothing . i think in soviet times , they would not warn , just act . the act serving as the warning ."
11345,a downgrade from 2nd world 
11346,he probably doesnt know 
11347,that sounds about right . i miss mccain .
11348,the first nuke that's launched guarantees 1000 will be . there's nobody on either side who will take the last punch and back down . end of humanity and the web of life .
11349,why would we give them nukes ? 
11350,"ukraine had 1700ish nukes and gave them up , i dont think giving them new nukes is the answer were looking for ."
11351,that would make absolutely no sense whatsoever
11352,and the worse haircut is highly debatable .
11353,i'm just tossing insults towards putin . maybe he reads reddit ??
11354,"of course they can . this is the problem with proclaiming warning after warning , and doing nothing . your warnings become meaningless . imagine if russia gave no warning , then used a tactical nuke . the soviets would do this : putin's russia , no ."
11355,have we seen working one for decades
11356,"never heard any brasilian say that . lived in several cities around the nordeste and spent time in sao paulo , wife is brasilian . they tend to be *** far *** more inventive than that ."
11357,"former soviet spy , always looking for moose and squirrel ."
11358,or opposite : will cement putin regime by zombyfying russian population even more .
11359,would it ? haven't we passed every red line russia has drawn ? inaction due to fear is how we landed in this nuclear terrorist situation to begin with .
11360,"live on your feet , or die on your knees ."
11361,"how very russian . oh , wait . this is 5d chess . it turns into a drinking game . the russians are used to crippling alcoholism . all of nato is seen collapsed in a gutter throwing up kebabs and putin unveils his masterstroke ."
11362,"probably on the phone , extorting the leader of a nation that is under attack from russia , and trying to invent dirt on his political opposition .... whilst hiding in a bunker , and admiring the "" brilliant "" work putin did invading ukraine in the first place . my god you people are ridiculous ."
11363,"first world and second world were countries that aligned with western or soviet infrastructure , trade , weapons , influence , etc . third world countries were mostly undeveloped and not aligned with either side . it does not explicitly mean poor , though we often use it that way ."
11364,which means there is never a sane time to launch the first one .
11365,nato members can request that nuclear weapons be stored on their lands . ukraine will not control them but they will be there if that scenario ever would to play out
11366,"because that was the deal when they surrendered the soviet ones they had . we agreed to protect their sovereignty , they agreed to hand over a massive pike of soviet bang bangs , with the understanding that if we ( and russia ) didn't protect them they would go after nukes again ."
11367,"because they lost their nukes under fraudulent circumstances , and because russia has forced the rest of the world to accept that nukes are unfortunately the only thing that matters . it is vital for every other nation to disarm that the protections granted by disarming are held sacrosanct . the full might of nato is held at bay by nukes , there's no bigger kid in the playground . if we show the world that giving over your nukes and disarming in good faith gets your country raped , there will never be another nuclear power who willingly disarms ."
11368,they damn sure wouldn't have been invaded if the still had them .
11369,ukraines nukes werent under ukrainian control .
11370,"mad does make sense , its the basis of our whole security infrastructure ."
11371,"not really , he was the sexiest man in 2012 on some western journalists standards . don't think putin ever won that outside russia ?"
11372,"they gave conditional warning : if ukraine attack crimea , and ukraine didn't yet ."
11373,""" o que um peido pra quem ta cagado "" its quite common in the south"
11374,glad to see someone got the reference to a quality russian spy !
11375,"nah . i dont think it will be too long before separatist states start popping up in the soon to be former russia . without their resources , moscow will wither and die ."
11376,highly possible and very worrying
11377,"thing is , putin still thinks he will win , and let's be honest , it's still possible if he starts using wmds . it counts as a win even if western ukraine becomes a wasteland . now , once he realizes that he failed and has nothing left to lose , things will get hairy ."
11378,technically switzerland is a third world nation by that criteria
11379,guess what ? the soviet union is no longer and russia is just a remnant of that era .
11380,"according to mao zedong , who coined the terms , first world were the superpowers , the u.s . and u.s.s.r ., the second world were the countries that aligned with them , and the third world were the non-aligned countries ."
11381,"i know . under the old meaning , switzerland was a third world country ."
11382,now this response makes sense 
11383,"but why would we want another country to have nukes ? lookim completely for arming ukraine and pray that we send them fighter jets . but i cant comprehend the stupidity of people who think we should send nukes and/or highly secretive technologyno matter how much hopium you smoke , its not going to happenbecause the majority of the us population is entirely against itif we arm another country with nukeswhat makes you think our enemies wont do the same ?"
11384,"eh , i think that is entirely overblown . the command and control was always russia's . ukraine could pretty much only used them as dirty bombs or sources to sell nuclear material . they were never an actual deterrence force ."
11385,all available information so far shows that putin and current invasion are very favored by majority of population . there is no much data points in opposite direction .
11386,"> let's be honest , it's still possible if he starts using wmds it's a sobering and difficult thought . if the wmd's start flying , then we can probably say "" noone wins "". but beyond semantics , it would almost certainly push nato to intervene which would then be horrific all around . unequivocally , though , if the conflict reaches that point , it would also be the end of russia as anyone alive has ever known it , along with the complete and utter deconstruction of putin as well as anything he has ever built or envisioned . where ukraine stands at the end of such a conflict is debatable , but there is no realistic situation , as i see it , at least , where putin can tally a "" win "" of any kind through the use of wmd's ."
11387,switzerland is fully aligned with russian stolen money .
11388,"yes , that's why the statement is ironic ."
11389,"mao did not coin the terms . there are two separate versions . the western version from the forties that were as the previous person said ( 1st is us and allies , 2nd is soviets and allies , and 3rd is unaligned ) you are referring to the maoist version from the 70s . obviously most people in the west use the western version ."
11390,"yes , thank you for more detail . i should have been more clear on the difference between first and second world ."
11391,"so did you read nothing in my comment ? or did you just see that i replied and repeated your nonsense ? we want the world to have no nukes . russia promised ukraine not to attack it if it disarmed , arguing if you're protected by diplomacy you don't need m.a.d . ukraine sees this logic , disarms it's arsenal , and then gets raped repeatedly and violently . the rest of the world watches on and learns that _diplomacy means nothing_ . _treaties mean nothing._ . we are showing the world that not only are nukes able to hold the entirety of nato at bay , but that they're the _only_ way to defend your nation . _not only that_ , but they are also learning that whenever big nations take away your nukes even under fraudulent circumstances , you don't get them back . you get raped and everyone watches throwing money at you . _how_ do you not grasp how this is _terrible_ for global disarmament ? how can you not see what this is teaching the world ? its all well and good to stick to our word when it's easy . now that russia has shown the planet nukes can hold literally _any_ army in the world at bay , we have to keep our word when things _don't_ go our way to ensure our word _means_ something , and that countries willing to disarm aren't scared away from the prospect by being raped over and over ."
11392,"i think that's wrong . the critical component is the enriched plutonium . even if ukrainian engineers could not determine how to reverse engineer the missile , they could simply remove the plutonium and put it in their own custom-built missile . this war has shown that ukrainians have domestically produced some very effective missiles . with enough time , there is absolutely no reason why with enriched plutonium in hand , they could not have built their own strategic missile defence ."
11393,"rockets were built here , it would be easy ( possible ) to build new ones . problem was clinton and incompetent people at the head of the state back then ."
11394,thats actually not true
11395,"they threatened nato by nukes if they intervene , nato didn't intervene . i don't think they threatened poland or finland by nukes ."
11396,i wouldnt put too much faith in what russian people say in public or in surveys . really any numbers that come out of russia at this point are highly suspicious .
11397,the majority who were surveyed .
11398,"low yield wmds can be limited to ukraine if used "" properly "". they can still basically make ukraine into a moonscape . the question is then how does nato , and specifically turkey react to this scenario , as they will feel the secondary effects of such weapons . putin would not use wmds for a win scenario though . that would be the "" if i can't win , nobody can "" scenario ."
11399,"oh no , they love american and european stolen money too ."
11400,you were right .
11401,i read your response . i just dont agree that we should give them nukes . i completely understand how much of a tragedy this war is . yet that doesnt mean we should re arm ukraine with nukes . were trying lower the probability of nuclear conflict . not in increase the number of holders 
11402,"the ukrainian armed forces were in appalling state until 2014 , the problem was the corrupt ukrainian government that got booted out . they gave away warplanes to the worlds poorest country as an example of how well their pre 2014 military was run ."
11403,theyve even flown their nukes to the swedish border if thats not a threat i dont know . but so did the us with b52s just a view kilometers inside poland at the ukraine border .
11404,"it's indisputable that a lot of russian families are split , and i read the other day that young russians in the west are being railroaded by their families for giving into ' western propaganda '. relevant video :"
11405,"> low yield wmds can be limited to ukraine if used "" properly "". oof - another toughie . i would question whether russia has the control and sophistication to detonate a series of limited-scope nukes that would not completely devastate their own border cities . let's hope this question never has to be answered ."
11406,at least they are true to their values .
11407,"then your problem is basic cognition and reading comprehension . you're an idiot . how _the fuck_ are you so stupid ? how can you not grasp that cheating ukraine out of nukes and having their country raped _fucks disarmament for every other nation_ . how are you this dense ? how are can you not grasp that every _other_ nuclear nation thinking of disarming is _watching how ukraine is being treated_ . how can you not fucking understand what this example is showing every other nation ? ukraine was _lied to and tricked_ to steal their nukes which would have _entirely_ prevented this entire conflict . the rest of the world is seeing not only how powerful the threat of nukes are , but also how terribly dangerous _dissarming is_ . i'll repeat that because you're an idiot . _the world is being shown that disarmament is a terrible option_ . the first thing we have to do is mend our reputation by _giving ukraine their own nukes back_ , a capability they only gave up under false pretense . after faith in our word is restored , then we start the process of disarming once again . but as long as russia is able to hold off all of nato , the world will be taught _nukes are ultimately the only thing that matters_ . as long as ukraine stays disarmed , the world will learn to _never ever ever ever_ give up your nukes . i'll repeat that for you just in case reading is hard . if ukraine isn't returned their _own_ nukes , the rest of the world will never ever ever ever disarm themselves after watching what happened to the only other country to do so ."
11408,"that doesn't has anything todo with the fact , that if not usa pressure back then , today we would not have thousands of lives lost . these corruption stories are too overblown . this deal was probably the worst deal in history of ukraine , rivaling maybe only pereiaslav agreement . both are paid with blood right now , this very second"
11409,\> theyve even flown their nukes to the swedish border ? what ?
11410,let's hope so indeed . cheers
11411,they couldn't afford to keep their even half of their jets running and sold them off for pennies and you think they could have ran a nuclear weapons program ? they were running t64s instead of t80s that's how bad it was for them until 2014 .
11412,"yeah , blame putins aggression on the clintons ? what a dog shit story bro !"

11451,poland is placing itself as a pre-eminent part of nato and the eu . having a massive military really helps put poland on the map and takes the eu and nato away from being france/germany/uk ( nato ) centric a little bit .
11452,damn that's impressive . poland certainly will have the strongest military in europe after that .
11453,they really like korean stuff huh

11463,so my question is what if hypothetically ukraine pushes russia back enough where their current weaponry can strike deep into russia ? would they agree to not fire upon russias inner infrastructure ? or would they continue to repel russia with strikes deep inside borders ?
11464,it's not a terrible approach . they are sending ukrainian soldiers out of country to train on these weapons systems and they simply can't take tens of thousands of them out of the battle to train . train a core . send them back in country to train others . this is the best way to manage the introduction of new weapons systems . ukraine's preferred solution would be for nato members ' air forces to come in and wipe the floor with russia . the only way that happens if russia directly attacks nato or drops a nuke on ukraine .
11465,it is a fairly sound strategy as the ukraine army doesn't have these capabilities . unlocking these capabilities with little to no training is just a waste of money and it will end up with more people dying unnecessarily . arguably these capabilities should have been built up when russia invaded the crimea but the ukraine army was nothing before the west came along and trained them up .
11466,"and you have to realize the us is still stinging from the afghanistan withdrawal fiasco . you cannot blame the us for wanting the ukrainians to prove their mettle on the battlefield , as opposed to sending them billions in military hardware , only for it to be abandoned to the russians . so yeah , "" leveling up "" is a good way to put the us's approach , and it isn't unwarranted ."
11467,"sending a bucket of advanced equipment would have been a bad idea . we've seen how ukraine was able to organically integrate all of this us equipment which is helped by the small numbers . had they sent 100 himars , half would have been destroyed by now as they would have been used poorly ."
11468,even a slingshot can fire into russia
11469,its the only way the war will end . i hope so too .
11470,wont happen until spring at least im afraid . theyre going to try and squeeze europe over winter w gas . also need to be realistic on what giving up could look like . doubtful they will give up crimea
11471,"i'm just an armchair general , but i highly doubt russia , especially putin and his goons , will accept or tolerate defeat in any shape , be it retreat or being pushed out . the best case scenario we can hope for so far ( regarding russia , that is ), would be for russia to declare the operation a success and then simply "" end "" the war by declaring the conquered territories russian land ... i mean...""independant "", and putting all their army on a permanent defense , so they can claim that any ukrainian counter-offensive is a vile act of aggression . this would be sold off as a massive achievment and make the war seem worth it because putin can actually still come out on top and maintain has narrative of russia being a hero . the worst case scenario on the other hand , would be far more grim : if ukraine manages to push back the russians , even as far back as crimea or the russian borders , putin might actually be insane enough to declare the counter-offensive an act of war against russian home turf and put his nukes to use , because it's obvious he won't be able to push back the ukrainians any more and having russia lose even more land than they had before the war would be a catastrophic result which could end putin's reign back home , given the last remaining soldiers return and will tell everyone about the failures in ukraine . putin won't have that , so he'll prefer to nuke ukraine to hell and leave back scorched earth to , again , sell off the operation as a success and the nukes as a neccesary measure to hold back the ukrainian "" aggressors ""."
11472,"to the surprise of no one , they're desperately short of man-power so releasing or rotating forces would be difficult , while being brutal to their own people comes naturally . the lie of "" it's not us , it's lpr militants torturing our troops "" is sort of impressive even by russian standards though ."
11473,thats an improvement over soviet barrier troops who would have just executed them on the spot
11474,"i'm not sure if russia actually plans for retreats . this could only add to the chaos behind the front lines , where supply depots have been disappearing rather quickly ."
11475,"it's not going to be fun . i mean , it will be satisfying to take out russian occupiers and see lands returned . but we all know how russia will respond . like crybaby whiny little bitches , they'll stage more terror bombing attacks on civilians . and we have to count on some of them getting through air defenses . it's something that must be endured . as long as putin continues his genocidal war . i hope this doesn't come to pass , and i hope ukraine suffers minimal losses as they kick the russian invaders out ."
11476,"i agree , russia is the kind of army that can get routed if panic starts to grow "
11477,yea - the de-escalation faction keeps dragging this war on . give ukraine the tools it needs to push russia out quickly . its the only way to a negotiated peace that russia will respect .
11478,ya i do not understand how this is ever going to end without another country having to getting involved . it feels inevitable . something needs to happen asap bc soon ukraine is going to be completely destroyed .
11479,fuck putin !
11480,those are all just facts . nobody cares about facts .
11481,he didnt threaten to leave nato outright he threatened to leave nato if more countries didnt start to boost their military budget . something that happened after ru invaded . 2 . he also was a outspoken critic of german energy policy ( german reliance on russian gas ) which by far is the biggest domino which could implode the new sanctions and the biggest western fault in fp towards russia . trump like many leaders was a mixed bag with good ideas and some very bad ideas . but his policies towards nato and eu energy wouldve made nato and the eu stronger .
11482,you just repost the same thing over and over again it belongs in another thread . or maybe one of its own
11483,"i read some comments that the head officers commander prokpenko nicknamed redis ( i think he is a colonel ) and deputy commander palamar among some other officers got taken to a prison near moscow . but take that with a grain of salt i don't have a source . there is video evidence of the commanding officer of the 36th ukrainian marines volodmyr baranyuk alive and taken as a pow . he was believed to be dead after an amount of ua forces were defeated whilst attempting a breakout at mariupol . he was believed dead for about a month or so , i remember a video of dpr or russian forces finding his rifle and gear on the ground in some field on fire ."
11484,"once ukrainians , especially soldiers , get into russian hands , they will never be seen or heard from ever again . even after the war is over : russia will never hand them back or even admit to have taken them to begin with . it's standard fascist/dictatorship protocol . russia is struggling to keep their own army up and running , so they'll torture any information out of them , abuse them for propaganda and then make them disappear forever , because the last thing they need or care about is keeping pows alive by wasting ( food ) resources on them ."
11485,beat me to it . fuck putin
11486,what the hell . hope police was called on those rusian shitheads .
11487,r/beholdthemasterrace
11488,shit-apple doesn't fall far from the tree .
11489,"the west probably just ignores putin and lavrov now like they do kim . responding to the endless firehose of bullshit just justifies it . attacks on odessa after signing a deal , bombing the theatre are all actions that speak for themselves . if you speak out against them you are either speaking to people who already know its scummy , or drank so much putinganda that it wouldn't change their mind anyway"
11490,i'm more bothered by the allies drones materials leaking into russia .
11491,thank you for your service
11492,close to a mental breakdown .
11493,who cares ?
11494,my dad confidently informed me that ukraine would fall soon . he doesn't like it when i laugh at his jokes . i then gently informed him of all the aid poland had gotten and that it only seemed that way because his news zoomed in on the donbas area .
11495,"if you are poking without protection , you might want to get a vasectomy"
11496,i feel sorry for your kids .
11497,"ukraine already got space marines . baneblades are still in production with an anticipated delivery date of 10,000 a.d . and an undetermined as of yet budget - probably in the quint-trillions ,. m808bs have a delivery date of 2500 a.d ., so only a few hundred years away with only slightly less development cost than the baneblades . at-ats and star destroyers unfortunately belong to the disney megacorporation . at this time , disney does not sell pmc services . yet ."
11498,no titan walkers ? by the emperor !!!! what heresy is this ??!!!
11499,we should partner with the japanese and build them a mechagodzilla
11500,they need a super gargant
11501,what no titans ?
11502,"and yet we rather have germany as a neighbor than the russia . we rather have germany as an ally than the russia as an "" ally "". i wonder if it will be a "" germantopicday ""."
11503,kicking and screaming but they are doing the right thing it is annoying how they need bullying to do what is right but they are doing it
11504,"the prevailing opinion is that there is no great shortage of ammo overall , but that most of the smarter ammo has been severely depleted . russia has a lot of bullets , shells , and rockets but a lot of the good stuff is used up and they are just sending the unguided stuff downrange . ive also seen reports that the artillery barrels are becoming increasingly worn out and inaccurate ."
11505,russia has not made any progress in last 2 weeks .
11506,"kinda impressed with how off your keeping up with the ebb and flow of this war is . russia didn't start off a war on it's own time with a complete shortage of ammo . it had a lot of equipment that it discovered was "" lost "" or not usable , when it kicked this off , but it still had a decent amount of precision munitions , and a fuckton of dumb ammo . it's first problem started in the north near kyiv once it moved out past 50 miles of it's staging bases and had to truck in shit , but due to misusing what precision munitions it had , and failing hard in the air war , russia couldn't protect it's convoys which cut off it's forces from their needed supplies . then russia retreated , and swung around to the donbass region where it again started from initial staging bases , and also had rail lines that it kept it's artillery train next to , this allowed them to have ammo piles right next to the artillery and lay down withering fire . but they again moved out away from their staging grounds , and then himars came into play taking out the ammo dumps and the artillery piles , again forcing them to pull back and truck in supplies from deep into russia . while at the same time russia had blown through almost all their precision munitons and the sanctions prevented them from getting the parts to make more . which has in the last few week functionally dried up the ammo and supplies on the front ."
11507,good for you ! have a potato ! and a down vote .
11508,"if they started off the war they chose the exact timing of and were building up to for years with a severe ammo shortage , they are even more incompetent than they look ."
11509,"they never had an ammo shortage . they had supply issues getting that to the front line . over time , between the front lines being closer to the border amd other factors , they managed to fix that"
11510,it will be replaced by breakup of the russian federation and third chechen war and buryat secession threads
11511,i don't really see any reason to stop them while the war still rages on .
11512,"i wish it stays up as the comment section allow for twitter links and bit of moderated dynamic discussions . and it would help keep the conflict in the spotlight for worldnews visitors , especially when there are no big news and needed the most ."
11513,i hope so
11514,this is the second time someone has asked about this . sus .
11515,i think there is enough international wrangling on this one that it will stay up the whole time unless a north/south korea style stalemate happens .
11516,the work .
11517,"yes it is , the one with "" h "" is the ukrainian name ."
11518,"the iris-t have first to be manufactured . the approval process isn't holding back anything at this point . when germany announced that they want to deliver these weapons it was always clear that this wont happen in a matter of some weeks . end of the year is a more realistic date for a best case scenario . and that the government will refuse to approve the export is highly unlikely after scholz himself announced the delivery allready in front of the whole parliament . regarding the tanks for poland . it seems that poland had completely unrealistic expectations . they wanted hundreds of leopard 2a7v . a version of which only a few dozen exist . not even the german army has upgraded most of their ( very few ) tanks to that version . there is just nothing there to give to anyone in short term . instead germany offered stocked 2a4 ( which are older models but still way better than t-72s ), that would be upgraded to 2a7v in the same pace as the tanks of the bundeswehr . that doesn't seem to have been good enough for polands government and since then they have been acting as if germany broke a promise and practically insulted them personally by not magically conjuring up hundreds of the latest leopard 2 models out of thin air and gifting them to poland . i know , many on reddit love to read stories about how germany is deliberately delaying help for ukraine . but i strongly advise to not just believe such stories without checking the facts and reasons . there are some who have an interest in undermining the unity of ukraine's supporters and attacking individual nations like germany or france . don't play into the hands of this propagandists ."
11519,"regarding germany : it's not really clear if this is a delay because the iris-t slm production is no easy matter . for the first one that shall be delivered in octobre/november ( a date both sides know since day 1 ) the german government already had to convince egypt to wait for their delivery . here scholz likely declared "" national demand "" to circumvent the original deal ( citing demand of germany and gifting the system to ukraine ) which isn't possible with the current concept . with this ukraine shall get money from the german government to buy needed stuff from the german weapon manufacturers and it decided to try to buy ten more iris-t slm with it because it is likely a convincing system . this should be the application that is on the desk of scholz which he hasn't signed since three weeks which is the only real information the original article has . the problem here is that iris-t slm has to be produced first and there are already other customers waiting for it with no exit clause in sight . so the iris-t slm deal isn't something scholz can simply sign and everything is good . this will likely cause no delays in the delivery even if he waits two months more because in reality it will take years to provide the ukraine with ten such systems even with major efforts ."
11520,what's the reasoning there ? not offending the gas supplier ?
11521,all quiet on the eastern front .
11522,should it do that ?
11523,"the could had try escaping by the windows but some weird conditioning prevented them to do so oh well shit happens , welcome to hotel ukraine motherfuckers"
11524,"it also is looking like it will independently have a ' f $%& russia ' armed forces , almost on its own ... ( based on russian performance in ukraine )."
11525,plottwist : and then they will invade germany
11526,because korea already has a working relationship with the polish defense industry . plus the transfer of technology and domestic production are very enticing marketing strats .
11527,"south korea was one of the biggest investors in ukraine pre-war . they are the most logical partner for a combined eastern european defense industry . south korea would probably also like to make investments and help rebuild the polish and ukrainian shipbuilders , which were once the best in the eastern bloc ."
11528,"it's cheap , nato compatible and doesn't have any sort of strings attached from russian gas-dependent countries ."
11529,the biggest issue i see is the maintaince . if you run so many different weapon systems that will be difficult . make sense if the keep the us tanks to get rid of the leo 2 then .
11530,"oh , the dumbshit fascists will vote for him , and there are a lot in the south and the midwest . now , if the point is that it would be an existential threat to democracy and ukraine if the dipshit fascist party re-elected him , i would agree with you . having grown up in missouri and oklahoma and worked in texas for 25 years , there are a lot of dipshit fascists who would gladly re-elect that orange benedict arnold ."
11531,yes to remind everyone what a fucking twit he was who even thinks of voting for him because he was perfectly willing to fuck ukraine over for his own personal benefit .
11532,"out of honest curiosity , what made him a washington outsider ( he and the clintons were good friends before 2015 )? and why do you think his presidency is when he \* started \* making dumb ass decisions ?"
11533,andrew yang should be back . there's your political outsider .
11534,depends on how deep they attack . belgorod ? fair game . moscow ? would stop any kind of military support for ukraine .
11535,true . though there is a middle ground with expensive / rare systems like atacms - just supply a specific number to attack pre-approved targets . this way the us could reduce the risk of these weapons being used to say attack russian cities etc . if ukraine sticks to the plan then they can set up the next target list and get missiles for that and so on .
11536,slingshots can fire much longer than you'd expect . source : total war games
11537,"doubtful they will give up any territory , being forced out , on the other hand "
11538,"i agree with this take . putin probably feels he can pull another chechnya where the chechens were initially successful , then they just leveled the entire country ."
11539,"your best case scenario would lead to russia becoming emboldened to invade ukraine again in the future , along with other countries they have their eyes on . your worst case scenario is ridiculous , because it implies we should instantly concede any land to russia with no recourse due to the threat of nuclear war . this leads to russia having free reign on any land it wants ."
11540,"if you think being executed on the spot is worse than being tortured by russian cops , think again ."
11541,"well , for all the russian f\*ck ups , they're withdrawl from kyiv was picture perfect . the pulled that off without anyone getting left behind and isolated . it was shocking in how well they pulled it off . retreat underfire is often considered the most difficult military manuevre , and upto that point there the russians couldn't differentiate their elbow from the ass-hole ."
11542,"funny , i had a whole disclaimer written to avoid comments like that but i deleted it since i figured that people are smart enough to not come off like compete blowhards with an axchtchually , war isnt fun "
11543,"actually , ukraine has turned the corner with surprising speed with the recent help of western weaponry . they have completely stopped the russians in the east in just the last few weeks and are pummeling the sh1t out of the russians in the south . ukraine is not losing this thing , not even close ."
11544,"ukraine must and will fight for itself , as we have seen . the us will supply them , perhaps more slowly than what most would prefer , but i suspect the turn of the tide has come ."
11545,let's not forget what he was impeached for : witholding military aid to ukraine . it's almost as if putin asked and his puppet delivered
11546,"he was not a mixed bag , he was a traitor piece of shit with no more ideas for governance than a common housefly seeking a pile of shit to feast on ."
11547,"trump : "" germany , i've always known that germany , they are bad people , i know it better than anyone . you look at germany and they are not doing enough . it's a shame but that fat cow leading the place , she's bad news . i know it . i know it ."" galaxy-brained trumpist :"" in this statement , trump laid out a coherent case for why becoming overly dependent on russian energy import could prove to be a devastating security threat should ukraine-russia relations destabilize . typical libtards taking him out of context ."""
11548,"he's only a mixed bag if by that you mean a bag of horseshit mixed with bullshit . he was a puppet and only wanted to put himself up on the national stage - he actually didn't understand any of the "" policies "" he espoused ."
11549,trump has no good ideas - his 2020 campaign didnt even have a policy platform . that youre doing this level of mental gymnastics is beyond absurd .
11550,good ideas ? 
11551,"and now he's out there warning that germany investing in their military is dangerous . lol . > he also was a outspoken critic of german energy policy ( german reliance on russian gas ) which by far is the biggest domino which could implode the new sanctions and the biggest western fault in fp towards russia . oh please stop . the only reason he said that was because mr . clean coal also loved clean fracking . he publicly said he trusts putin more than his own agencies , he didn't give a shit how the west would be prepared to sanction russia ."
11552,"ok , dude . i love how the trumpy sycophants keep doing hermeneutic backflips to "" trumpsplain "" trump to the masses . he is a toxic asshole who continually undermined nato and threatened to leave nato . he was only a "" mixed bag "" to the trumpies who continually hoovered up his bullshit putin maneuvers and "" trumpsplain "" his assholery to everyone else . i know you voted for him twice and have to ease your conscience by trumpsplaining your betrayal of ukraine and nato . go to a priest and absolve your fucking sins . don't tell me what that asshole "" intended "" to do ."
11553,"well , i'm not american but the american elections will probably determine the outcome of the war as much as any post-kyiv battle happening on the ground in ukraine will . putin's strategy is that the west gets tired of the war and bails on supporting ukraine . there's a certain element of the republican party that share putin's goals ."
11554,this is not really true . there has been a number of prisoner swaps
11555,i was downvoted a few weeks ago for suggesting some pretty serious restrictions on what russians who've not given up nationality living in estonia ( or any of the baltics ) should be subject to . man i stand behind that now and realize they might have been too lax .
11556,a shit leopard can't change its spots .
11557,"you mean the consumer product cameras and hobby rc engine "" materials "" or was it something else ?"
11558,western components can mean many things to be honest
11559,"he gives useful insight into the perspective on that side from someone with access to russian information , who isnt completely delusional about the situation"
11560,and prep .
11561,[ it's a gundam !!!!](
11562,"the russians have tons of dumb fire ammo the issue is that their artillery doctrine is to spam them with no regard for accuracy , which means an enormous ammo expenditure . now that himars is taking out all their forward ammo dumps , they're in trouble because their logistics isn't designed for mass deployment of trucks to deliver stuff to the front lines , but are instead reliant on their rail network . they don't even use pallets and pallet jacks , everything is moved by hand . having millions upon millions of tons of ammo is useless if you can't get them to where the guns are ."
11563,he's not wrong in the context of reddit analysis narrative on these threads . poor reading compression and a lot of headline generals and some misleading reporting just to name a few factors . if you just read comments russia was out of supplies for the entire push to the edge of servodynsk and the initial stages of the battle then it was russian propaganda that that they were dropping tens of thousands of shells a day until the nasa maps got popular . then then a brief quiet when in fact the ukrainian forces had to retreat due to lack of ammo . every report or tweet of a local shortage or a soilder complaining was instantly characterized as systemic to the russian forces across the entire country . most people on social media representing any side of any topic are not good at developing nuanced opinions .
11564,""" south ossetia reunification "" and "" transnistria demilitarization "" while you're at it ."
11565,me too . i like the sticky thread . keep it going until ukraine wins or the war is put on hold for a few months .
11566,.uh.you hope what ? i didnt really state a preference
11567,so much work . 
11568,if germany ever wants to truly take a global leadership role they will have to get used to people in other countries criticising their policy decisions .
11569,"in fact , it's difficult to imagine that the german government would consider it possible to deliver , for example , the most modern self-propelled howitzers and mlrs to ukraine , but purly defensive anti-air missiles would exceed the limit and provoke russia to much . the same applies to the leopard 2 for poland . there is no logical reason for germany to intentional delay or cancel anything . germany has made poland an offer that is apparently not good enough for them . now these tanks will go to other nato members , are used to upgrade the german forces , or at some point they may even go directly to ukraine . as for constantly spreading such news at all , that germany is allegedly delaying aid to ukraine . there might be some reasons for that . russian propaganda to undermine the unity of ukraine's supporters . conservative media in germany that wants to badmouth the new left-liberal government . general distrust of some european states towards the two big ones , france and germany ... in any case , these missleading reports aren't helping ukraine ."
11570,"who knows , who knows "
11571,"well , there are a lot of these buildings housing russian soldiers all the time , and very seldom does anything like this happen i just dont want people thinking that barracks arent safe ."
11572,"fascinating , yeah they both share less than friendly neighbours with numerical and quantity advantages , so makes sense "
11573,"ever since the ukraine invasion , i have seen comments from his supporters claiming he would have handled it better or that it would have happened at all as if he was some superhuman statesman . of course , the morons fall silent as soon as anyone challenge them with documented statements/events that shows what an utter failure trump is when it comes to russia ( and foreign policy in general ). trump is incredibly dangerous even during normal times , but he would have been a catastrophe during this time . russians knows how he would have acted too . this is why russian state tv said [ they wanted their ' partner ' back ]( i voted for biden specifically to ensure trump did not remain in power and , damn , am i really happy about that now . if he somehow runs for election again in 2024 despite all that happened , i'll vote against him again ."
11574,"he wasnt a politician . although he was rich and connected , he wasnt a politician . a lot of people like me wanted someone that wasnt part of the system to take control . and many of us regretted our actions . and he sounded too good to be true , in retrospect . edit : i specifically remember the moment of being so damn excited to see a non-politician be elected . but then i also remember the disappointment that followed . :/"
11575,"a vote for andrew yang is just another vote for trump . i'm tired of people indulging in the "" outsider "" fantasy . that's a government by fanfic . there are no "" outsider shortcuts "" to solving our issues ."
11576,"exactly they couldve just supply an initial batch of just a few dozen 300km rockets for ukrainians to prove their mettle , then go from there"
11577,"1 . best case : well , obviously that would be the logical consequence . for russia , that would be the best case once they'd have no more realistic chances to win any more territory without otherwise being "" forced "" to use their only remaining ace : nukes . 2 . it doesn't only imply it , it's literally how countries that have nuclear warfare as an option operate against others who do not have it . russia is already grabbing the world by the throat with their threats , because it's hard to estimate which ones are real or not . incase you missed it : the reason nato isn't getting involved beyond weapon/material deliveries is exactly because of that : nuclear threat . my guess why putin doesn't care about it so far ? probably because he knows the nukes are and always will be an option for him , defense or offense . even so , as you could see and still see in the news : nato is already tip-toeing around the minefield because they are afraid of putin considering anything above a certain level a direct involvement in the war . if you seriously believe putin's army will run back to russia with their tails between their legs or worse : allow ukraine to re-take the conquered areas , you are very optimistic , if not naive . putin didn't start this war for shits and giggles . no matter his reasons or outcome , he will not leave this war as the loser , be is subjectively or objectively speaking ."
11578,"> your worst case scenario is ridiculous , because it implies we should instantly concede any land to russia with no recourse due to the threat of nuclear war . this leads to russia having free reign on any land it wants . that has been the status quo for quite some time ."
11579,"> well , for all the russian f*ck ups , they're withdrawl from kyiv was picture perfect . listen to pow interviews . a whole lot of people were left behind . either due to screw ups , or due to cowardice of the officers ."
11580,"i'm not sure if ukraine has the mechanized forces needed to catch russia . retreat is relatively easy to do , if you're faster than the opponent . russia has plenty of vehicles ."
11581,"wait , it is ?"
11582,"openly treating it like a spectator sport is pretty crass , tbh ."
11583,"i believe ukraine will win , at great cost . russia and putin will lose ."
11584,what r ur thoughts of german energy independence and nato military spending seems like a lot of countries followed trumps advice once russian invaded .
11585,and they laughed . and look where we are now . interesting .
11586,i think we've become more wary of russian assets within american politics for that to be less of a problem .
11587,i understand where you are coming from but this post belongs in another thread or one of its own . not here not to mention this donkey dude just reposts the same thing over and over again
11588,"i'll book that one under "" propaganda "". of course russia would abide to prisoner swaps in order to maintain the image of them being reasonable and not as barbaric as the media portrays them . but now i ask you : do you think those "" number of prisoner swaps "", in return , make up for the thousands of unreported , genocidal kidnappings of ukrainian civilians , which russia denies of having conducted , eventhough there have been independant reports confirming they've done exactly that ? the strategy is simple : do 1-2 prisoner swaps for every other 10 + ukrainian ( civilian or soldier ) you take out of the country as a pow . you still gain a "" profit "", while at the same time keeping up the propaganda image ."
11589,what are the chances its ruzzian psyops ?
11590,"reading compression is your bailiwick , i guess ."
11591,right ... i meant i hope they become an indefinite thing until the war ends .
11592,"constructive criticisim is good and right . for example , one can certainly question whether germany can help even more . but for whatever reason spreading false or missleading information that harms not only germany but also its allies and in this case specifically ukraine , is dangerous . other than that , i think germany was very satisfied to just play a peacefull supporting role in the world . germany must be forced into the role of a leading military power . no one here wants that . it's just accepted as a sad necessity because of russia's agression and the us beeing unreliable at times ."
11593,was this hotel safe ?
11594,"> a lot of people like me wanted someone that wasnt part of the system to take control . and many of us regretted our actions . there's something broken about the way our journalism , education , and popular media builds up the "" benevolent outsider "" as a modern mythical archetype . it's such a common narrative now -- and a completely false narrative -- that we need "" outsiders "" and "" disruptors "" to fix our systems . they never "" fix "" systems . at best , they come in without the knowledge of the system , so they have no idea what they're doing and end up accomplishing nothing at all . at worst , they break systems and force them to rebuild themselves -- and this allows the elite and privileged to corrupt the process and the rebuilt system is way better for them to insulate their own interests and better exploit the rest of the masses . the idea is everywhere . business especially . basically the entire consulting industry is built to some extent on this false myth ."
11595,he never sounded good . that should have been a strong indicator of what was to come .
11596,"cool , thanks for the honest answer . i don't have a leg to stand on for not voting , but it seemed from the beginning this guy was a part of the system . no one born that rich stays out of the system , especially when a previous president and america's mayor , along with prime time talk show hosts were his friends . have your views on his initial outsider status changed ?"
11597,"what made you think that a washington "" outsider "" would be a good idea ? dubya was an outsider , and made some of the biggest blunders in us history . iraq/afghanistan wars , the great recession , a near crash of the stock market and housing finance industry . no thanks , id rather have someone with experience and judgement in charge ."
11598,it seems there's no insider route either . the dems have made it very clear that they would rather lose to fascists than actually fight for a real progressive platform .
11599,"the nukes aren't really in play . just don't invade russia that's it . russia has a nuclear doctrine putin can't just use nukes because he's mad . and then strategically , they use nukes and then what ? there's no next move ."
11600,"the best case scenario is ukraine retaking their land . if russia wants to go the nuclear option that's on them , but will mean serious consequences , including cutting off any remaining gas and oil and completely cutting off their banks and trade ties to the west . remaining support for russia in the east would dither , as supporting a nuclear strike is a much tougher pill to swallow . i could see western countries sanctioning any russian allies at that point . nukes are understood to be a defensive option , not an offensive one . nobody is suggesting russia couldn't use them , but it would be a rapid departure to use them against a nation that didn't intitiate the war against you . you're naive if you believe your best case makes things in any way better , it only serves to make things much worse . there comes a time you draw a line in the sand and say "" this far , no further "" and we've reached it . you cannot forever cower behind threats of nuclear war . in such a case i'd suggest you start learning russian . we're all a little scared , your posture is understandable . but you're at a point where you're willingly putting on chains ."
11601,"clearly not in europe , which is the topic at hand ."
11602,[ hot shots told me so .](
11603,"putin has lost already . his goal was to quickly and rapidly take over and subjugate the whole of ukraine , something that is now self-evidently impossible for russia no matter how long they keep trying . even if by some miracle they succeeded in occupying the whole country , they would not have the resources to manage the inevitable partisan resistance and would eventually have to withdraw in disgrace . but even that is so far beyond their capabilities that it's laughable to even discuss it . he has shown russia's military to be a completely embarrassing paper tiger that would never stand a chance against nato , thus drastically weakening russia and its empty bellicose threats . he has damaged the russian arms industry , whose customers now see even its latest and most advanced products as pretty useless in modern warfare . he has made russia into an international pariah , with so few friends they can be counted on a single hand with fingers to spare ; even most former soviet countries are distancing themselves from moscow . this isolation will only get worse as the food crisis they have caused inflicts serious suffering around the globe . he has set russia's economy back years , from which it will take decades to recover . he has politically placed himself on the edge of a cliff , and people are starting to line up to give him a push . putin has lost . plain and simple ."
11604,"well , yes , trump did every putin command , but whaddabout ...........?"
11605,"yeah , they laughed because for every statement of merit the guy made , he would make 50 that were completely incoherent . let's not fool ourselves with "" look where we are now "" as if economic protectionism in the energy sector of germany would have prevented russia from invading ukraine . trump is the one who called putin smart for launching this catastrophic invasion , yet another example of the unhinged nature of the guy ."
11606,"he does actually have a bit of credibility in him . he was the one of the first to break the news something happened to the moskva , the tank columns near kyiv , one of the first to reveal the failed river crossing last may and constantly stressed how poorly equipped russian forces were . for the last one , i think he mentioned how ddr forces looked like "" they were going to war for the czar ."""
11607,he's been so negative on russia's performance that some internet conspiracy theorists are even beginning to suspect him of being cia psyops .
11608,"my sense was that russia was in danger of "" out of supplies "" north of kyev , due to the stalled convoy ( russian forces were clearly overstretched as well , but the lack of supplies seem crucial , given the convoy frozen in time .) . and.............then the russians retreated , for some reason ; it couldn't have been supplies , of course . i don't think many thought russia was "" out of supplies "" after the move over to the donbass , close to the rail lines which are the lifeblood of russian war doctrine . and russia was able to , admittedly slowly , move forward in the east , close to their rail lines and supplies for the last two months . but slowly . himars apparently are now hitting russian supply depots in the east and south , within the range of himars and guided artillery supplied to ukraine , so the reliance on close rail supply is now a "" problem "" for russia like the convoy was "" a problem "" ( not as bad , but a huge problem given the artillery-based strategy).you can correct this if i am wrong . but i think logistics , just as in the kyev assault , are increasingly a problem in the russian forces . or you can explain the rapid decrease in artillery assaults over the last 1-2 weeks ; perhaps it is the new russian fondness for ukraine ."
11609,"he didnt always sound bad . once he secured the bag , he went crazy . edit : ok thx for the responses . youre highlighted my ignorance with first vote . but i voted that mf out round 2 . i dont support trump so back off . sorry to offend . edit 2 : thx for not voting me to hell . i was misguided and unfortunately came to my senses after it was too late . i regret the vote , and i dont regret much ."
11610,"absolutely . someone is an outsider , but are they really ? i think i now want someone with less influence . politicians and people with influence ( the rich ) can be in the same place ."
11611,he was the wrong answer to the right questions . saw that somewhere and thought it was very well put
11612,"dubya may not have been a * dc * politician , but he was governor of texas for goodness sake . and i don't know how much you can be a "" washington outsider "" when you're the third generation of a dc political dynasty , including your dad who was in washington for 23 years ( first running for dc office 7 years before that ), culminating in the presidency ?!"
11613,"comment appreciated . sometimes a change of scene is good . the idea that anyone in the us can be president shouldnt be discounted . anyone should be , not just politicians . presidents have substantial advisors , which works well when they dont have personal experience ."
11614,"well if the choice is ineffective , fake-progressive dems or fascist gop , it seems clear who to vote for ."
11615,progressives have made it plain they would rather a fascist be in charge then someone who actually looks for consensus .
11616,"1 . they use nukes offensively : ukraine , which has so far hoped and counted on russia not using their nukes , will now realize that russia is here to annnhiliate the country and is willing to use even nukes to achieve their goals . ukraine will probably surrender to avoid any further destruction and loss of life . nato will also probably stop supplying ukraine because the war escalated from a conventional one to one of nuclear warfare . russia wins the war . 2 . they use nukes on the defensive : ukraine will stop any further counter-offensives to avoid russia dropping more nukes and again : to avoid more destruction and loss of life . russia gets to keep all the newly acquired territory . if they will continue their invasion another time or whatever , remains to be seen . russia can still sell off the war as a massive success because they liberated the "" independant "" territories from ukraine and has annexed them . russia "" wins "" their war . let's stop pretending like we live in a "" everything is gonna be alright if we just believe the good guys win "" kind of world . everyone in their eight minds knows that russia is the aggressor and that ukraine must/should win the war , but ignoring the enemy's perspective and underestimating what they are capable of doing and how far they are willing to go , is a very costly mistake . there is always one or more steps beyond "" and then what ?""."
11617,"either i did not explain my point well enough , or you misunderstand . i am not talking about the general outcome of the war . my replies were directed at the person's post that hoped for russia to simply call it quits and leave ukraine without any further escalation or consequence . i was presenting my points from russia's perspective , not ukraine's , not a neutral party's perspective . of course russia losing the war , ukraine re-taking their land and peace would be the absolite best general outcome , but , again , russia , in my opinion , will do anything possible and neccesary ( again : from their perspective ) to leave this whole war as the "" winners ""."
11618,"whaddabout fuck trump , fuck his blackmail of zelensky and ukraine , fuck his every attempt to do putin's command , fuck his attempts to undermine nato , and fuck his threats to pull out of nato . what about that ? and fuck those who try to "" trumpsplain "" about how trump , despite everything he said , was trying to "" strengthen "" nato and ukraine . fuck off . i'm not an idiot . he should have been impeached for the ukraine blackmail but the gop was too damn grimawormtounge to do anytthing . and i include trumpsplainers like you in that category . jesus . when an malignant asshole attempts to blackmail a head of state facing russia , believe him--he is a corrupt malignant asshole . you can put lipstick on a pig turd , but that will remain your lovely trumpybear ."
11619,was one of putins demand make germany not energy dependent on russia? 
11620,has he been wrong on reported facts though ?
11621,"i am not talking about reddit memes , i am talking about what apparently is occuring to russian forces in the east and south . perhaps it is coincident to himars and accurate nato artillery being supplied and has nothing to do with the explosions in what appears to be ammo and supply depots in the east and south of ukraine . please elucidate your understanding of these events ."
11622,"there was a group of black kids falsely convicted of rape in central park . later on , dna evidence exonerated them . trump later on took out full page ads about how they were guilty . he is not a good person ."
11623,he sounded bad decades ago . embarrassing reasoning .
11624,"he was mobbed up since the 70's ; his father from who he inherited everything was a neo-nazi ; trump himself exhibits every malevolence of his father ( fred trump ), he was an entitled piece of shit who stiffed his contractors , he was in putin's pocket , and assholes like you think he "" was not a normal politician so good ."" yep , he "" was not a normal politician ,"" all right and he was making money off of the oligarchs after he bankrupted his 3 casinos . i never understand the trump worship . he is a malevolent failure of a human being ."
11625,i dont know im not from the usa so i was not exposed to him so much until he became a candidate . the only time i came across him in any meaningful manner before that was when i watched the apprentice a few times . he was utterly clueless and looked and behaved like a mentally handicapped bully . it was like watching a sales rep role-play the general manager of the company he worked at .
11626,enough people voted for him the first time ( not a majority but barely enough given the electoral college bullshit ) to elect him . i thank you and others who didn't vote for that traitorous ass the second time . we need you .
11627,i appreciate u .. i wish there was millions more like u .. u saw through the b.s ... even after u gave him the benefit of the doubt .. there's nothing wrong with hoping for the best ... but in this case .. we got the worst ....
11628,"usa had its outsider with obama . only a couple years of washington experience . was not mega wealthy and had experience of working with grass roots people for a long time . the right wing lost its mind so badly over something about him ( who knows what lol ) , the tea party spawned which basically made the crazies a voting bloc . now the republicans have to pander to the christian right and the crazies to be elected . this is why in the last decade you get republicans actually talking about space lasers . mtg and her ilk were voted in as a direct push back to a black man holding the presidency . it took the masks off the us . and it was always the same ilk of people . trump pushed the birther lie for years , i can't believe how racist that was and how the usa just forgot about it....clearly its not a deal breaker for a huge swathe of americans . fox news pushing such insanely racist narratives as ' terrorist fist jab '. that's just again , mask off full on racism . the establishment did a lot to keep obama out just as it did to trump . obama made mistakes , but he was a class act and someone who everyone who wasn't an american right wing nut job respected ."
11629,"thanks again , i've never personally witness anyone who voted for him openly regret trump ( when in theory , they have every right to regret ), but i have witnessed increased doubling down . it's good to know that there are people who voted for him who are willing to take a step back and reassess"
11630,"i mean , youre right . but thats also how you end up in a french situation where one side is a really crappy milktoast fake progressive pseudo-conservative nothing who constantly makes poor choices and screws over there base , but always wins because the opponent is a literal fascist , and they know this , so they feel they never have to improve . macron is not well liked by most of the french voter base , but 60 % of the country prefer him over le pen . that sort of arrangement breeds crappy leaders and political disinterest until enough people stop showing up that the authoritarian wins.or some other crazy shit happens"
11631,of course . but it's ultimately just a slower road to fascism unless we actually take steps to purge the fake progressive corporate hacks .
11632,"i'm being nice to that corrupt blackmailing jan 6 insurrectionist here . everyone from new york knew he was a corrupt piece of shit , but the gop and the midwest and south voted for him anyway , even after he proved he was a corrupt son of a putin-licking bastard . and they'll do it again . because they couldn't possibly be wrong about tripling down on trump and his insurrectionist putin-loving ass , could they ?"
11633,"not just guilty , he still called for their execution after the exoneration . he's a lunatic ."
11634,"i received a comment ( deleted ) that i have a personality disorder . if you voted for trump the second time or defend him after the ukraine blackmail and after jan 6 and after his frankly psychologically deranged comments about the "" steal "" for the last 2 years , you might want to look in the mirror and consider "" what might be psychological derangement and a fascism attachment disorder ""? it might be you , not trump's critics ."
11635,"and just post it here , rather than emailing me , you cowardly piece of shit . yes . if you are not sufficiently brave to post a comment and take the consequences , shut up . god , the putin/trump asslickers are cowardly and toxic . maybe they are russian trolls , but they are cowardly assholes ."
11636,"> they did it successfully . but at the end of the mission they were ambushed by russian tanks, miroshnichenko said . the first shell injured luke . three guys , edward , emile , and bryan , they immediately attempted to help luke , to do first aid , and evacuate him from this spot . then the second shell killed them all. sounds like a bad roll of the dice and in war , one bad roll is all you get ."
11637,r.i.p to these extremely brave men .
11638,"[ edvard selander ]( i read an interview with a friend/colleague of his from the swedish defence force and he went to ukraine because he wanted to take the fight there rather than wait until it reached his own border . he was a true freedom fighter . edit : interview with a medic who was there > only two of the three groups of soldiers made it down to the old food cellar which they use as a bunker . outside , shells rain down around their comrades , who have thrown themselves to the ground to avoid shrapnel damage.in the bunker , 25-year-old paramedic tobias engqvist hears how the company commander is trying to get in touch with the platoon commander outside via radio . but no one answers.slowly it sinks in that the men on the outside may be dead or injured.in the platoon there are several foreign soldiers whom tobias warmly describes as close friends . one of them was edvard selander patrignani , 28 , from uppsala.now he and five other men are lying on the road outside . when tobias and the others are finally able to go outside , they are greeted by "" a lunar landscape "".- ashes and dust cover everything , everything is grey , says tobias .- first i see luke . he lies there peacefully and seems to lie on top of mile . next to them , edvard lies just as peacefully.bryan has also died.further on they find the platoon leader who has broken an arm and a leg . 200 meters away sits another young , swedish soldier . he is in shock and has shrapnel injuries to his legs and lower back.the two wounded later tell them that the group's plan was to treat luke , who had been hit by shrapnel , and then get to the bunker . but they don't make it before another shell hits right where they are.today , tobias engqvist finds comfort in the fact that edvard and mile probably died instantly and felt no pain .- it also gives some relief that they died together . none of them were alone at the end ."
11639,"well , swedish news interviewed another swede that was with the swede that was killed and he said it was artillery ."
11640,"> the foreign fighters were dispatched to the area to reinforce ukrainian troops and were tapped specifically because of their skills and experience , according to a situation report obtained by politico that described the attack in more detail . every loss of life is sad , but this loss is particularly painful . experienced foreign fighters are rare from what i've heard . most of the volunteers who went to ukraine have little to no combat experience ."

11643,"i hope when the bodies of these men are returned to the states they are buried with honors by their communities . it is a rare thing to have courage enough to volunteer to fight for the freedom of others , especially in the face of such brutal conditions . i cannot underscore enough the moral character and sense of duty it takes to leave a comfortable life to defend the people of another nation from true evil . hats off to every one of them ."
11644,"they are fighting in a war zone , and some of them will be lost regardless of their nationality . they are fighting for what they believe in and choose to be there . that's a hell of a lot better way to go out than if you were forced to fight like the russian sob's who die daily ."
11645,"you know , they fought like skilled soldiers , and they died like skilled soldiers refusing to leave their brother behind . those are men . those are heroes ."

11649,we are all put on this world to accomplish something that will bring meaning to our lives .
11650,names ? photos ?
11651,glory to the heroes .
11652,this is one war i have no problem paying taxes for . i don't like that it's happening but that's out of everyone's control .
11653,till vallhall !
11654,the west will fight to the very last ukrainian
11655,could've been avoided if they weren't there .
11656,i didn't know russia had any tanks left .
11657,our countries should all be doing more in ukraine . it shouldn't be left to ukranians and western volunteers to stop russian aggression in europe . nato should be directly involved in combat .
11658,"with so many countries munitions involved and the russians can't defend themselves from drone attack , or even tell who or where it's coming from , it's time for some heavier attacks"
11659,guess they found out the hard way the media wasn't telling the whole story about how dominant russia is being ..
11660,good thing we have sanctions on them / s
11661,this war is atrocious . it's a shame but i don't see this ending well for ukraine .
11662,"as an american , im in agreement of military aid to ukraine , but id rather our men stay home because of * our * growing threat of dictatorship/authoritarianism ."
11663,i mean this is truly unfortunate and my heart goes out to loved ones of the deceased . but they really shouldn't have been there in the first place . leave the fighting in eastern europe to the eastern europeans . glorifying these men is the same as glorifying people who leave to join isis and fight in the middle east .
11664,i hope my country starts deporting russian citizens in response .
11665,i may get downvoted for saying this but at this stage of the war the foreign legion should either disband or move into a support role elsewhere . it's any wonder they have accomplished what they have under a command and control structure using a completely different language . the situation was different in early weeks but ukraine has the manpower now .
11666,"bty , what are they doing there !"
11667,the russian people are mostly good people like americans and every other country . we all have those that are assholes and have no ability to think outside of a bottle . war has never solved anything for very long it just sets up the next war . greedy powerful people like war and know how to manipulate nations into war . time we say no more war .
11668,foreign mercenaries serving in the armed forces of ukraine . rip . is there any number s available for how many foreign mercenaries are serving in the armed forces there i wonder ?
11669,"\> the foreign fighters well , they signed up for it"
11670,isn't them killing americans already grounds for intervention
11671,ah hell naw
11672,russians are killing americans now ? when is war declared ?
11673,"after an hourlong battle , it took the russians a tank to take out 2 americans canadian , and a swede ?"
11674,"i want video ! damn , back to r/gunfights"
11675,"one of these days russia is going to kill american pedestrians by accident , and im not sure what the shit storm after will look like . i mean , its how we got launched into ww1"
11676,received injuries incompatible with life ...
11677,ukraine can't win this war because they don't have a nuclear weapon . russia could nuke kyiv and the world would only give more sanctions .
11678,"i didn't even know other countries are sending volunteer soldiers to ukraine . thought putin would take it that as a declaration of war from those countries . perhaps only if one is caught and revealed to be from some other country , or needed to be in just a much larger scale ."
11679,"jesus , that's horrible"
11680,"there is a video on ig where a ukrainian detachment is on the side of a road and in the background you can see a tank approaching , one of them begins to greet it , believing it to be one of their own , and as the tank approaches , it shoots and vaporizes 10 soldiers who were on the spot , and when i say vaporize , i'm not rhetorical ."
11681,sounds like an attack on nato members to me
11682,"been thinking about that a lot lately tbh , very humbling"
11683,time to send ukraine more weapons .
11684,wwiii here we go .
11685,"damn , that is really horrible . where did you find this account of what happened ?"
11686,border
11687,"a freedom fighter , what a dumb fuck"
11688,his a fool if he thought there would ever be a war between russia and sweden .
11689,"an american fighter in his unit said it was also artillery , they got trapped ."
11690,> most of the volunteers who went to ukraine have little to no combat experience . didn't ukraine state that they want only volunteers with combat experience ?
11691,"i heard or read these four killed recently all had military experience , don't know if any had combat experience ."
11692,"> every loss of life is sad , but this loss is particularly painful . what ? civilians dying are the bad thing . mercenaries dying is just the expected ."
11693,the experienced ones are smart enough to not intentionally walk into a battlefield
11694,loss of russian invaders is not sad . thats what the world is fighting for
11695,"alas , that is the risk they are taking when they enter the field of battle . this isnt call of duty - this is real life ."
11696,"well they got themselves killed , only they are to blame for their own deaths , this isn't battlefield , it's the real battlefield"
11697,eh they couldn't of been that skilled .
11698,"if they were so experienced , how did they die ??"
11699,you heard wrong !!! stop spreading stuff you don't actually know anything about . go back to your car and look cool pushing the pedal down ...
11700,50 % of the deceased were not american ...
11701,swedens only real potential enemy in a war has always been russia . edvard said that he would take this fight to them rather than wait for it to reach our own border . that speaks volumes to his character . he didnt have to go but his moral compass led him there . vila i frid
11702,the vast majority of the ukrainian home defence forces are also conscripts . men were prevented from leaving the country with their families and drafted into the war effort . there are conscripts on both sides of the conflict .
11703,"russians fighting now are by and large volunteers , mobilization has not happened ."
11704,""" war that has nothing to do with you "" ah , to just be naive and think enormous world issues have nothing to do with you , when they are having detrimental impact on everyone . must be nice to be living in that bubble away from reality ."
11705,read something besides reddit then .
11706,"nato is a defense pact , ukraine is not in nato . nato explicitly cannot be involved . the member states can get involved on their own accord however ."
11707,"nato getting directly involved in combat with russian soldiers 20km from the russian borders is world war 3 . it would be a * massive * escalation , and would convert nato from a defensive alliance to an offensive one which is willing to prosecute military action . that is absolutely unacceptable and antithetical to the nato mission . individual * countries * should contribute as much as possible to ukraine , including funds , equipment , ammunition , intelligence and training , but a direct involvement is out ."
11708,"are you personaly ready to go fight russians in ukraine , and , moreover , bring the world to the edge of ww3 ? is another money carve-up between billionaires worth it ? better think before you suggest nonsens ."
11709,this is explicitly what putin desires . shhhhh .....
11710,paid to post this or just a fucking idiot ?
11711,"nato will be directly involved eventually . ukraine is a speed bump to ww3 and a testing grounds to see how battles are shaped and won on and off the battlefield . even if there's peace for a bit between rus/ukr , russia will try again . this is a security fight for them eventually too , the ccp/pla is going to make a push to control the first island chain , which is another spot , among many others which will bring us ww3 . whether or not it goes nuclear , well ... "" western "" nations are finally and slowly waking up from their greedy drunken slumber they've been in since ww2 finished and they're still kicking and screaming resisting the new world that they played a major part in shaping ."
11712,because russia isnt dominant ? the only way theyre gaining any ground is heavy artillery . and they dont want to destroy everything because they want to take it over . russia is getting fucking spanked in combat .
11713,"bro what ? theyve been fighting there for months , they couldve told you what its actually like there"
11714,most wars are .
11715,"ukraine will win this war . russia failed with their 1st surprise attack at full power . they will never be as strong as they were on day 1 . ukraine on the other hand repelled russia with what they had on hand and the aide trickling in . then repelled them again when they tried to focus on the major cities . and now that russia is focusing on the regions close to it , they are at a stalemate . except ukraine is getting better supplies , better equipment , and better trained . first artillery . then himars and other systems like it . and now f15's/f16's and talks of a10's ? those last three will be major shifts alone . but bottom line . ukraine is getting stronger , and better . russia will never be at the power they were at day 1 , and they are getting weaker , and less supplied . this war will end eventually . and it will suck that russia keeps the fight going . and the only question is how much russia is willing to lose before they accept defeat . once f-15's and f-16's are flying around i feel like ukraine will remove the ability to accept defeat from russia and just defeat them . if russia is smart they will accept defeat before then to lessen/lift some sanctions . otherwise those sanctions will remain there for a long time after ."
11716,"i'm so worried this won't end well for anyone . the us is basically at war with russia , we're supplying training , weapons , etc . idk if that's the right or wrong thing to do , but damn is the future uncertain ."
11717,"america has until 2024 to to a pass/fail on the dictator test . they passed in 2020 , though it was rough ."
11718,you may want to pick up a history book for the answer to that one
11719,because someday it may be your country that needs help .
11720,"one reason can be this : the fight for democracy / liberalism against autocrats and tyranny is international . history has shown that tyrants like putin never ceases to amass power , so sooner or later all free people will have to fight if the tyrant is left alone sufficiently long .."
11721,> glorifying these men is the same as glorifying people who leave to join isis and fight in the middle east . it's 07:49 and i'm 100 % sure i've read the dumbest thing i'll read today . that doesn't happen too often .
11722,"you need some perspective . people helping out ukraine that was invaded by russia ( who , by the way , have and are committing war crimes and genocide against the ukrainian civilian population ) is not the same as others joining a terrorist organisation . also , by the way , if ukraine loses this war and russia conquers the country , it will absolutely and negatively impact the rest of the world for quite some time to come , including , most likely , wherever you happen to live ."
11723,look at the little communist dipshit making vietnam-related references over the death of some good soldiers in a war a russian cunt started ...
11724,"i'm not american , but it's good to see the us supporting nato and attempting to keep russia from destabilizing europe more than they already have . as for tax dollars , perhaps all y'all should stop funding commerical prisons , hospitals and universities . imagine the money your save if your taxes didn't generate profit for massive corporations when paying for essential services ."
11725,"yeah supporting ukraine is the reason the us has not been funding those things for decades . that's the reason . you're so right dude . if only we weren't supporting ukraine , all of those things would be properly funded and the money definitely wouldn't instead have gone to buying military equipment for ourselves or other countries that are not ukraine . ugh such a bummer . fucking ukraine taking our education , infrastructure and healthcare money since the reagan administration ."
11726,good . i'm very happy to literally see my tax dollars at work blowing the shit out of russian invaders .
11727,how in the fuck did us tax dollars go into funding people who volunteered and flew on their own money to ukraine with their own supplies ? mate are you dumb ?
11728,"well , it's not like they are hostages , they want to fight so they fight . it's their choice"
11729,"not mercs . they most likely arent paid , and are under the flag of ukraine . but russia is openly using wagner so theres that ."
11730,american soldiers arent fighting russian soldiers
11731,russian military * should have * stayed home as well .
11732,"the us government at the beginning of the conflict said any person going to ukraine to fight is officially disavowed and the us government will go to absolutely 0 lengths to try and save you , or even acknowledge you exist ."
11733,"not if they are in ukraine , a known active warzone that you are officially * not * supposed to be going to . as for want constitutes "" grounds for intervention "", there is already enough even without incidents like this . nato should have intervened and called russia's bluff . even if it wasn't a bluff there should have been an intervention rather than setting the precedent that nuclear capable nations can do whatever they want to non-nuclear nations outside of nato ."
11734,the geneva convention says that those american are considered mercenaries
11735,"upvoted not bc i agree with you , but because thats a legit question . however as others have said , no . they are mercenaries ."
11736,never i hope . those people chose to willingly go to an active war zone against the wishes of their government . they knew what they where signing up for .
11737,"it's not that other countries have * sent * troops . it's that individuals from other countries have * decided * to go . officially , the u.s . and pretty much everywhere else is discouraging their citizens from going there to fight . if something happens to them there , the governments of their home countries generally can't do anything to help them ."
11738,"yeah it was also posted here on reddit a while ago , it was brutal . the guy filming will never be the same again ."
11739,did you use the vaporize choice of word because the top twitter said that too ? or did you independently say that ? legit curious
11740,"honestly , these days , likely nothing . the us wants to avoid a war with another nuclear power like the plague(no pun intended ). especially w / russia , they're super unpredictable . most i could see is a complete blockade on russia as most , angry phone at least"
11741,"no need , america already kills americans on accident everyday"
11742,they were volunteers
11743,doesnt sounds like that to me .
11744,"nope , those arent nato troops . they are western volunteers ."
11745,nato members are countries/states . not people .
11746,the us government doesnt think so and they wont start a nuclear war over this .
11747,all in favour aye 
11748,"time to actually send men , stop with the damn half measures"
11749,"this is disturbing . doesnt anybody remember the mujahideen ? the liberation fighters all over africa ? south america ? any time americas sends weapons and money into conflict zones around the world it always leads to something even worse down the line . the ukrainian government is corrupt and not so good guys when we arent looking . from banning political parties to restricting press , its all from the same play book that leads to worse things down the line . stop the weapons . stop the money . what happens 20 years down the line is a real threat and all u guys are doing is encouraging it . this is madness ."
11750,"nope , they went to ukraine to fight on their own volition ."
11751,"edited , ty"
11752,"how is that description wrong ? wait , my bad ; how is that description wrong , you dumb fuck ?"
11753,whats wrong with that ?
11754,what are you angry about ?
11755,"that was true pre 24th of february , but not now . theres a reason sweden and finland wants to join nato now ."
11756,"was listening to an interview today of an american who just came back from ukraine . it's a mixed bag . you got volunteers with no experience and actual army veterans . the folks with no experience at all were filtered out at the beginning and they joined the territorial security force . so they only do checkpoint security and simple stuff . some veterans know their shit and after proving themselves in the first battle they join sf teams and get the fancy gear , or are sent across the country to train ukrainian soldiers . some folks , apparent veterans , talk shit but ran when they encounter small arms fire . the guy being interviewed said they kick these men off the team ."
11757,"that was after the first wave of volunteers already got in , at least"
11758,these ones did . they've been in the country for months . i follow one of the fighters on tik tok where he said a week ago they were killed when he posted it . he said they got bogged down in artillery and they got trapped . the russians launched an offensive after the barrage . russians retreated with losses but these 4 didn't make it .
11759,"at the start it was open to just about anyone with a pulse from what i remember , don't think there were any restrictions stated the first time around . i don't think ukraine really expect the response and number of people that showed up . they changed it to only people with combat experience rather quickly iirc ."
11760,wouldnt be surprising they ease restrictions as the war goes on .
11761,i would hope so but their new recruits are being released to the front lines after only 3 weeks of training and theyre running out of experienced military personnel pretty fast .
11762,there's different ways to volunteer . their contract foreign fighters are mostly vetted by the embassy staff in the volunteers country . but lots just met up with in small groups in poland or flew to poland and crossed into ukraine . from there just takes some asking and some hitchhiking to get to the front .
11763,they probably thought playing cod count as experience .
11764,canadian media is reporting that emile-antoine didn't . he was a firefighter presumably with medical experience which is needed .
11765,i think they mean it's extra painful in terms of losing more experienced and better troops than losing some freshly trained grunts
11766,"must be nice to not have anything in your life or way of living be on the backs of those who died fighting for you . while some fights are pointless , there are many , including the one where these soldiers died in , that are important and just . even if you dislike ukraine and their policies , they are still the victim of putin and their innocent people are being murdered and raped and abused . they are being cleansed . these soldiers stood on the side of that to defend innocent lives . so have some respect , or at the very least keep your comments to yourself ."
11767,some fights are just .
11768,2142
11769,i think they knew that going in .
11770,"that makes what they did braver and more worthy of praise . not less . i don't think call of duty kids are lining up to go out there . and i don't think anyone there thinks if they die they are going to respawn . nothing you said here makes sense , unless you are trying to be edgy ?"
11771,and you can go fuck yourself .
11772,"not even remotely what i was saying , but sure .."
11773,how to put words in someone else's mouth reddit speedrun wr
11774,"> but not because russians and ukranians die there on daily basis it's sad when ukrainians die , i'll give you that . but russian invaders ? they can eat a bag of dicks and rot in the dirt . if they valued life they wouldn't go to another country to kill people ."
11775,"in the end , everyone is buried in the us . there is no escape ."
11776,have a coworker that fled from kyiv at the beginning of invasion . was not able to leave the country since then and was somewhere to the west of the country trying to not get drafted since he is just married .
11777,the people who are in a bubble are the wannabe heroes who join another countrys war because theyre bored and get used as meat shields to protect the soldiers who are actually defending their country .
11778,"literally no one ( news sources , that is ) is saying that they dont have anymore tanks . at best people are saying their tanks are being depleted ."
11779,"i agree with what you're saying . however , there is precedent to pursue military action without ( defensive ) justification from the side of nato . the bombing of yugoslavia is testament to this precedent ; no member state was under attack and no un mandate was given ."
11780,"100 % agree , which is why it is the way it is .!"
11781,agreed . it still seems morally wrong to be responding indirectly like this .
11782,"are you willing to roll over and let nuclear powers bully nations outside of nato ? i don't want to live in a world like that , and i don't think our species deserves to survive if we are willing to allow it ."
11783,"russia isnt capable of ww3 . clearly they cant handle a minor european country , much less the entire might of nato . and yes , wed rather protect our billionaires than let putin invade europe and kill more people . he clearly will not stop with ukraine . if you doubt the wests resolution , go read up on the last little fascist fuck who tried to take over europe . if you love putin so much , go join his failed army ."
11784,what mainstream media is encouraging ww3 ?
11785,90 % of nato is involved with everything other then our own troops .
11786,> ukraine is a speed bump to ww3 and a testing grounds i agree . it's great military intelligence to see what russia's forces can do on the battlefield .
11787,new world order lol shut up
11788,"artillery+drones is modern combat , it's not the 18th century ."
11789,> the only way theyre gaining any ground is heavy artillery . like in any modern war ??
11790,all wars are . unless there's some kind of war that involved cuddling puppies and kittens that i missed out on .
11791,"sure , but russia can and will just keep throwing bodies at the grinder . both sides are losing lots of people , but russia has a lot more where those came from . this is basically how they fight any war ."
11792,you really think russia will accept the loss without resorting to using weapons of mass destruction ?
11793,"the downvotes on my comment above scream f-u , i am ready to have someone who looks like * me * and who follows * my * religion and my beliefs rule us and kill everyone else! because its a fact these soldiers went over there to fight * against * a fascist dictator who invaded a country that was on their way to being a democratic success . "
11794,"i think my perspective is fine . i think wars where young men and women die to further the plans of old men are all atrocities . but you could just as easily swap roles . """" people helping out ( iraq/afghanistan/vietnam ect .) that was invaded by ( america ) ( who , by the way , have and are committing war crimes and genocide against the civilian population ) is not the same as others joining a terrorist organisation ."""" i'm sure in the eyes of the russia soldiers these foreign fighters who are unsanctioned by there governments seem like terrorists . i think what russia is doing is unequivocally wrong but its a wild double standard for the rest of the world to impose sanctions and demonize them while never having done anything to sanction and punish america for its decades long rap sheet of warcrimes and genocides ."
11795,"depends on what you mean . us forces / representatives of the us aren't . us citizens who joined the ukraine army to help fight the russians are ,"
11796,"that's true . our tax dollars for "" aid "" should've stayed home too ."
11797,"the precedent has been set by nato nations long ago ; take iraq 2003 for one . russia is following precedent , not setting one ."
11798,yeah let's just corner a country with nukes and give them nothing to lose .
11799,ah okay that makes sense . idfk why i got so many downvotes i was curious lol
11800,"additional protocol i defines a mercenary as a person who : a ) is specially recruited locally or abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict ; b ) does , in fact , take a direct part in the hostilities ; c ) is motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and , in fact , is promised , by or on behalf of a party to the conflict , material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of that party ; d ) is neither a national of a party to the conflict nor a resident of territory controlled by a party to the conflict ; e ) is not a member of the armed forces of a party to the conflict ; and f ) has not been sent by a state which is not a party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces.\[10 \] this definition is very restrictive because it requires that all six conditions be cumulatively fulfilled . in addition , the definition requires evidence that a person accused of being a mercenary is motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and is promised material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces . based on requirement c , no they're not . going to ukraine believe you believe in helping them fight an illegal invasion does not constitute you as a mercenary , you'd be a volunteer . its only if they're going for their own personal gain ."
11801,ty . idk why the downvotes it was a question
11802,"there must be , someone must have"
11803,pussies
11804,"war , what is it good for ?"
11805,aye
11806,i'm sure putin would be very happy to hear more westerners talking like this .
11807,"yes , killing millions of people who make no policy choices , and have been brainwashed for generations with propaganda seems like a rational and ethical choice . / s ( by the way...you're no better than putin )."
11808,dont worry . it will soon be the ussr again .
11809,the alternative is russia rolls over ukraine and starts looking somewhere else .
11810,"how about no . corruption was stomped out when the current administration came to power . and yes , they banned prorussian parties and prorussian press . during the war , not before ! this is normal behaviour for a country under attack by a fascist state ."
11811,"americans never learn lol , this will bite them back back years from now , just watch"
11812,because freedom doesnt exist outside america . / s
11813,what incentive would russia ever have to invade sweden ?
11814,who is it
11815,"> from there just takes some asking and some hitchhiking to get to the front . i'm not sure how you think you just show up at the front lines on your own and get given a gun and off you go to fight but that's not how it works , even in the middle of a war where both sides are no doubt rushing training to some extent . you need to be put under the command of someone , issued equipment , you need training or vetting that you already have it . some random person showing up at the front lines in civilian clothes or the camo fatigues they bought off ebay is going to be met with "" who the fuck are you ?"" in ukrainian and at best be turned around and worst be arrested until they figure out what kind of brain damage you have and what you were up to . of course you probably won't get within 20 kilometers of the front because you'd end up going through check points and not have the correct documentation or the equipment to look like a soldier . they don't stop the 12 guys riding on top of a bmp decked out with body armor and assault rifles but a one off in a car with no weapon that says in some foreign language "" i'm going to fight ?"" once again turned around or arrested . this is a war , not sunday afternoon at the paintball range ."
11816,"most of this is propaganda and nonsense . russia isn't waging this war even close to the intensity that usa fought in iraq or israel fought in lebanon . the russians aren't bombing out utilities like electricity and running water like the usa did , intentionally . israel bombed out all the bridges and highways in lebanon although the fighting was nowhere near beirut . ukraine has a sizeable russian population and that's where russian forces are . i'm not making a point that putin's invasion wasnt morally reprehensible , but people talking about genocide and ethnic cleansing need to get a grip on reality . the russian military is still showing restraint on how they're fighting . they fought a lot more ferociously in chechnya and afghanistan ."
11817,that canadian that everyone was jerking themselves off over noped out after 2 months
11818,"i didn't mean to be edgy . it is just that dying on the battlefield , though sad , is an expected danger of being engaged in a fight ."
11819,"well i ain't that stupid to go fuck myself in an ocean-far war without experience i feel bad for their deaths , it's tragic , but hopefully others learn how hard and deadly war actually is that not anyone can just go travel and fight there"
11820,what did he say ?
11821,did you just call me fat ?
11822,"not every russian there is fighting by his choice or will , conscription is still a thing in russia . like germana in ww2 not every wehrmacht soldier was a fascist dickhead nazi , many were drafted or forced into the army , some joined due ideological indoctrination but regretted it , the german wehrmacht and the ss along with the nazi party had many dissents and disagreements"
11823,"> if they valued life they wouldn't go to another country to kill people . do you say that about every invading soldier in every war ever ? did you say it about the coalition that entered iraq ? or does nuance only exist for western soldiers ? i'm not pro-russian at all , but that statement reeks ignorance ."
11824,"the secret goal of us foreign policy , to get all soldiers from around the world to be buried in arlington national cementary"
11825,""" another countries war "" there's that livin ' in a bubble again . you actually believe this war has nothing to do with you , huh ? don't think what's happening there is going to have enormous impacts on you ? wild ."
11826,yugoslavia didnt have nuclear weapons
11827,"curiously , that's what started the chain of events culminating in the mess today . russia considers nato a threat precisely because nato as a whole , not to mention individual countries , has shown an offensive stance ."
11828,"strictly speaking , yes . they wanted official un mandate but russia vetoed it , and nato did it anyway on the grounds that the actions constituted ethnic cleansing and no-one else was going to do anything . for what it's worth , the nato operation was purely aerial , and the stated goal was to permit a un security force to be emplaced . additionally , from a purely political standpoint , the operation did not pose a significant risk of escalation ."
11829,human morality doesnt much matter if much of the earth is radioactive glass .
11830,"it fucking * sucks *, yes . but i can understand the rationale , and in the long run it's correct ."
11831,good thing you are not in charge then . the world has sent billions in aid to ukraine and are still sending them equipment despite threats from russia . i would hardly call that rolling over .
11832,"they could certainly "" handle "" ukraine and nato if they use wmds . even just 50*5kt tactical nukes detonated on ukrainian military bases and other troops concentrations all over ukraine would deal absolutely enormous damage and set in motion the war nato against russia . with russia , the us + five eyes and eu being annihilated , it would mark the end of the northern hegemony over earth ."
11833,"what is the goal of russian intervention in ukraine ? i am more than sure that all your knowing of it lays in the field of left media that occupied and completely censored all news sourses , while your * beloved * putin just said it in his statement . but you dont need to know that , all you need is already dumped in your head , so dont worry and be happy , little internet warrior ."
11834,indirectly . nato is playing a huge role helping ukraine without crossing the line directly involving them . everyone is slicing the salami still without invoking article 5 .
11835,"also great to see how well us is integrated into it's allies as they've been providing intelligence to ukraine on russia's movements . you bet too china and iran plus many others are watching intently and reconsidering making plays but i doubt it'll stop them , hoping though , to be wrong ."
11836,"not "" new world order "" new world . a multi-polar one ."
11837,russia literally using copypasta strategy from wwii so don't try and say they modernized anything .
11838,artillery + drones is not modern combat . combined arms with close air support is currently the best way to wage a modern war . russian doctrine doesnt call for combined arms . it calls for artillery into an assault .
11839,except they're leveling cities . cities that they want . they've been forced to use arty that they didn't want to use because they wanted the infrastructure intact . now what forces then to destroy shit they wanted . oh yeah getting absolutely spanked by ukraine .
11840,"most wars are \*. in very [ rare ]( occasions , wars can be just purely formal with no combat , to the point both sides even forget they're at war . be warned the article wrongly classifies the "" pig war "" as bloodless , but a single pig did die in that war ."
11841,you weren't there man . the cuddle war was.....i still can't talk about it . so much licking . the horror . * the horror .*
11842,the emu war was a just war of vengence upon the white colonizers ! **/ s **
11843,the great emu war was mostly just humorous .
11844,"that worked really well in the 40s , but the current generation of russians aren't as willing to die for their country . they tried that in afghanistan in the 80s , and it is among the most frequently cited reasons for the ussr's collapse less than a decade later , along with chernobyl and general corruption and economic decay ."
11845,"60 years ago it was a great strategy . now it is a good strategy against an enemy who isn't willing and doesn't have the equipment to fight back . now a days we are are talking about artillery and missile systems that can strike enemies accurately before even being in eye sight . we have seen what ukraine has does to long convoy lines of tanks . russia starts doing the same with troops and it will be the same results . just a lot more dead russians . russia's current strategy failed at taking ukraine . then it failed at taking their major cities . it's not going to suddenly click and start working now . especially since russia is getting desperate . increasing the age and taking in prisons , and now reports of recruits getting days of training before being sent it . meanwhile ukraine is getting troops trained in allied countries on allied weapon systems that they are bringing back to ukraine . these bodies will be performing massively differently when one is green troops with days of training , and ukraine has trained soldiers coming in with training in artillery fire , himars , other missile systems . f15's/f16's . this isn't a war russia can win by throwing mere bodies at it . unless they finally do a mass mobilization of its people and exponentially increase the bodies they are sending . and even then artillery would rain down on the troops every inch of the way . it would be a bloody massacre ."
11846,"absolutely . putin doesn't want to die . russia doesn't want to lose its sovereignty . there is no one in that chain of command that would agree with that from putin , to anyone else . they will threaten to use nukes if we supplied weapons . they will threaten to use nukes of we sanction them . they will threaten to use nukes for any reason . but they won't use them for those reasons for the same reason they won't use them for losing this war . it's not worth it . they lose far more than they gain . remember this is not a defense battle where they actually lose anything . putin is safe from any danger . the people who can launch nukes are all safe from any danger . and none of them will want to flip that switch because that drastically shifts their position from alive to very likely dead , and their country dissolved before their eyes . and the world would move on without russia at the table anymore and they would only remain on a stain in history books that people look at as worse than nazi's for doing it . tldr : they would want to live ."
11847,people from around the world willing to stand with you and fight alongside you . like the men and women in the ukrainian foreign legion .
11848,"not everyone is a soldier or fighter . those with no combat experience can donate to the cause to supply equipment and funds . you were just given an answer to explain the situation , why are you being provocative ?"
11849,"well yes , but there is a huuuuge difference there . the first one would mean an open war between the us and russia . the latter doesnt ."
11850,"better use in ukraine than allowing freedom to die or , maybe , you dont believe in supporting sovereign democracies ? freedom isnt free ."
11851,kind of my point . when you don't have nuclear weapons/a nuclear ally you can be bullied by nuclear powers . your right to self-determination can be ignored internationally .
11852,"i fail to see how intervening in their invasion is cornering them , but okay , coward ."
11853,because there are many people who are more worried about their own lives and are therefore unwilling to risk russia launching nukes if nato intervenes with boots on the ground .
11854,many of the volunteers sign in with the ukrainian army so they are lawful combatants and nothing less .
11855,if the stakes weren't the end of civilization as we know it and potentially the end of the human race i might have upvoted .

11863,"you're right let me erase the pencil mark i drew thru "" russia "" on my kids globe"
11864,your feelings are definitely not fact on this one .
11865,"so ? let them . if russia truly is an institution that is as corrupt and collapsing under its own weight like everyone seems to be pushing . then let them . the sanctions seem to be doing wonderful like everyone on reddit seems to be talking about . its a big world . changes in borders and governments isnt something new , our history is relatively peaceful in a chaotic species . now that species is being chaotic once again . let the problem actually show itself then we can deal with it . we cant stop human culture dropping into human culture , i admit the last couple years was something amazing and one of a kind . it never lasts . human history is changing . we have bigger issues at home . ukraine is just another country in endless war and endless death . nothing ever changed ."
11866,"all i can say is good luck with that belief . exact same thing was said for so many other countries before and since . and the same exact people fall for the same pretty talk , never fails . no wonder the same tactics are used over and over again . from sierra leone to cuba etc . its the same words again and again ."

11877,"lol , 10/10"
11878,"> did you say it about the coalition that entered iraq ? why would i say anything when iraq was invaded ? i was twelve when it happened . now i'm 31 and have a much better understanding of how things work . also i'm ukrainian so i've seen with my own eyes what's happening in my country , and i have much much much more information about current conflict . and iraq is not being invaded right now . i think it makes sense to focus on what we can actually affect . but if you want to dive into whataboutism , so be it . i don't know all the details regarding iraq . was the invasion completely uncalled for ? was it confirmed that the invading side was purposely targeting civilians in order to spread terror ? was the invading side torturing pows and even civilians that had any tattoos related to iraq ? if the answer for those three question is yes , then my answer is also yes . those who invade to spread terror by killing and torturing civilians deserve to die ."
11879,trophies of the dead
11880,"correct , but it shows that nato cannot objectively be called a purely defensive coalition . and that is why nato intervention is possible in this case , but we'd be looking at massive escalation if nato did intervene ."
11881,"neither does ukraine . nato forces faced off against russian forces in yugoslavia . essentially they acted as human tripwires , if the russians attacked nato would crush them . so the russian troops stood down . same could happen in ukraine . move nato forces in loudly and publicly , not to fight but to cease the fighting . russia for all its talk will not attack nato ."
11882,"lol , yea . super offensive , unlike the country currently invading and genociding ukraine . it's all nato's fault ... sovereign countries shouldn't be allowed to join a defense pact in case it hurts russia's feelings and threatens it's ability to invade its neighbours . poor russia ."
11883,how so ?
11884,nato article 5 requires an attack on a nato member . its a defensive alliance .
11885,"indeed , you are correct . it did not pose a risk of escalation per se . an intervention today in ukraine would pose a significant risk ."
11886,"human morality doesn't matter if we never take a stand against nuclear threats/bluffs . russia can just repeat this process as often as it wants against non-nato nations . same with china . unless we actually say "" fuck you , push the fucking button * if you dare *""."
11887,i would say allowing hundreds of thousands to die/be displaced is indeed rolling over when it is * only * the threat of nuclear weapon deterring boots on the ground . the war could have been ended in a couple weeks with nato intervention . dragging it out is a choice the west is actively making . we should be actively enforcing geopolitical borders that are not changing as a result of diplomatic channels . i do not respect cowardice .

11892,"well yeah , everything from a full on war . were literally destroying our economy trying to help however we can . nato is fighting the war . as for setting boots on the ground , that would be a very very bad idea ."
11893,with china being a super power the current world is already bipolar . russia is just in no condition to even think about being one of the poles .
11894,"they are literally using "" copypasta "" strategy from wwll ? were there drones , sams , gps , and cruise missiles in wwll ?"
11895,"they've conquered an area approximately equivalent to england from ukraine , with no sign at all of losing any of those lands , but yeah they're getting "" absolutely spanked "". i know you've fell into the propaganda of making the enemy look too weak and too strong at the same time . but sorry to say , the russians are simply too strong in this case ."
11896,"i'd argue that those are not wars as they don't meet the overwhelmingly accepted meaning of the term . even the article you linked refers to "" bloodless war "" as an oxymoron . if we can be liberal with the definition of "" war "" then we can also be liberal with what we define as "" atrocious "". i'd definitely use it to describe the war on drugs . even the emu war sounded pretty atrocious ."
11897,absolutely ! never claimed otherwise .
11898,banning the main opposition party and mass purging top officials are signs of a thriving democratic process i guess lol
11899,but war shouldn't be our goal . let support this country with a little bit of rocking roll
11900,"given the history , americans coming in support of freedom has nothing but a negative vibe . but you're correct too and ukraine should be supported ."
11901,what do you think will happen when us troops start killing russian troops ?
11902,"why is ukraine worth world war 3 ? literally give me one good reason . by any and all measures ukrainians are no better or worse than russians themselves . to be quite honest , i don't think they're worth the economic devastation we're inflicting on ourselves in their name and they sure as hell aren't worth millions of deaths and societal collapse . edited to add : i was initially sympathetic to them back in february and march , but after months of reading overwrought nonsense from people like you , i've lost all sympathy for ukraine and eastern europe in general ."
11903,even as a joke this is stupid
11904,idk i can think of quite a few people profiting from war
11905,""" so ? people murder other people all the time so why not just let them ?"" quite the humanitatian we got over here ."
11906,"and , ladies and gentlemen , preserved in a time capsule , we have the same sort of appeasement rhetoric that lead to ww2 on full display over here . no shit what you are saying is the exact type of shit the isolationist are saying during ww2 and that sure as hell didn't do much to stop wars did it ?"
11907,"so does russia pay you for these posts , or are you just doing it pro bono ? edit for those catching up : don't bother . if he's not a russian troll he's an american idiot who thinks bad arguments make him cassandra and can't tell the difference between a chorus and an echo chamber ."
11908,you do realize when russia captures land it also captures the funds to keep capturing more land ? it's a feedback loop . appeasement allows the loop to continue .
11909,it's simple facts . a corrupt government will not be able to fend off an attack by fascists like the ukrainian gvt . is doing
11910,"most of the ardent ukraine supporters couldn't spot the country on a map before february of this year . now they want unlimited money to go to ukraine , a country which has a neo-nazi unit officially integrated into its national guard . a country where it's nearly impossible to not find a ukrainian soldier with neo-nazi imagery on them . taxpayer money going to such a place . it's ridiculous and will definitely age poorly in the future much like our funding of "" moderate "" syrian rebels and the mujahideen and pinochet has ."
11911,why would they want gotland ?
11912,she survived that alien invasion after all
11913,commercially and artistically .
11914,wali was not one of the best snipers on the planet . that was a myth . he holds no records and has admitted as much in recent months .
11915,"ukraine spent a lot of time and energy training up the last 8 years but that does not make up entire generations of experience and training that western armies enjoy . they , like russia , also have different playbooks , less discipline than the west but make up for it in sheer brass balls and dedication . i imagine it would be tough for someone like wali to integrate properly ."
11916,"if that was the case , how are they doing so well ? i'm sure i heard that wali guy was the one going around disobeying orders and shit too . i don't know enough about the situation but i wouldn't take one guy's word as gospel tbh ."
11917,"> had no business being there and amateurs with no decent training but enough about the russian military , how about the ukrainian forces ? haha"
11918,wali was passed they didn't entertain his idea of showing up and being treated as a god . whole thing was a media spectacle more than anything .
11919,"\> 3x larger by combants no , this is propaganda from the war and it's insane to me people still believe this horseshit . the us army was big , the iraqi army wasn't . saddam even ordered the baathist army to stand down and even gifted his airforce to his arch enemy , iran . the size of iraqi army on paper was pure fan-fiction from the time . saddam hadn't spent any money on maintenance in 10 + years , very little was functioning and only the smallest minority disobeyed orders and actually mobilized to fight ( which were untrained conscripts ). ukraine is a different situation , zelensky ordered his army to fight and it did . usa only fought conscript hold outs in iraq . that's 4000-7000 civilians died in the initial invasion in what , 3 weeks ? the only building that wasn't destroyed was the oil ministry . baghdadis went months without running water because the usa intentionally destroyed the utilities . it was a deliberate policy of bombing to destroy morale ."
11920,"> 2003 iraq invasion : 4,000-7,000 non-combatant casualties lmfao where have you pulled that number out of ? 6000 civilians died in the first day of the bombing of bagdahd . [ between 180000-200000 directly killed ]( and god knows how many indirectly . but nice try"
11921,"yup , never said otherwise . i'm pointing out that he didn't fully grasp that fighting russia would be more than a little different than fighting the taliban . i'm sure he's not the only one either ."
11922,"i don't blame him either , i was just pointing out that some of those guys have found out that it's very different than fighting the taliban.they don't all know what they're getting into ."
11923,"is every russian torturing someone ? is every russian there if there own free will ? is every russian targeting civilians ? no . to say otherwise would be extremely ignorant . you cant blindly state that everyone deserves to die for being forced to invade the country . blame the russian bureaucrats , oligarchs and proven war criminals ."
11924,if you're going to do this pathetically unoriginal trolling you could at least grow a pair and do it on your main account . coward .
11925,"i support ukraine , but not to the point that id be willing to risk nuclear armageddon for them ."
11926,"you got your whataboutism backwards in this one . ;-) but , yes , cuba was not allowed to ally with ussr and ukraine is not allowed to ally with the usa . it's not russia's or america's feelings , it's a genuine military threat ."
11927,"russia and the usa were rather friendly in the 90s , however , an attack on a historic russian ally broke that . russian prime minister famously ordered his airplane back to russia midflight across the atlantic once he heard of the bombing . then russia was sympathetic with the us over 9/11 and supported the invasion of afghanistan . didn't support the invasion of iraq ( correctly , as it turned out ). the mass of military incursions by the us with nato allies ( i think their number from 1990s to 2020s was greater than from 50s to 90s when it was constrained by ussr ), as well as mistreatment of russia on a number of questions ( like foreign support of separatist chechens ) ultimately led to putin's famous 2007 munich speech declaring a lack of confidence in the current global cop and a new multipolar world . right now ukraine is a pawn in the fight over the transition to the multipolar world . sadly , they were stupid enough to trust the usa ."
11928,so nato broke its own treaty when it went bombing belgrade which was not attacking nato members ? you perhaps you haven't actually ready the treaty ?
11929,could you please find some easier way to commit suicide please .
11930,"oooo go on tough guy , how many kill confirms do you have ? stop acting all like you're ready to die for it . if you've served in the past , then all the power to you , but at the same time , let's not act all macho in a incredibly delicate geopolitical situation"
11931,you want billions to die
11932,russia loses with the world . what are you going to do with russian nukes ? catch thousand of them with hands ? well they can even detonate them all inside without launnching and result still will be devastating for whole world
11933,"i don't disagree with you but they're going to regardless of what you , me or others think or want and considering their nuclear arsenal and willingness to make their own people suffer what do you think they're going to do . they've also allied with the ccp even if it's a weak alliance who aren't quite yet a super power . getting there for sure ."
11934,"1 . orlans do not carry munitions , and afaik ru has few tactical attack drones , or at least we are not seeing them really make ant impact 2 . sams have had no significant impact because ru still cannot maintain any air superiority , so saying sams have a major impact compared to wwii is moot . you had aa guns in wwii . 3 . if ru is using gps , they are doing it poorly , because they literally carpet bomb everything and rarely hit anything with precision munitions . 4 . same as above , their kalibrs are doing little if any real work , more often than not are being used for terrorism on civilians ( either intentionally , or they are so fucking bad at targeting they fly off course ). so yes , their current strategy is the exact same as wwii . bomb every inch of land , reduce it to rubble , then claim you are winning because your troops gains some utterly obliterated ground . just because they have a few occasional toys to use for this strategy does not change the core concept . most ground ru is taking is literally a hellscape that has no one living there now . that is not winning a war , that is genocide ."
11935,maybe look up that ukrainian forces from kyiv are now moving into occupied kherson . russia is getting fucked relative to any other nation in a conflict for the past 30 years .
11936,"what do you mean dying for nothing ? the war in ukraine is pretty important on the world stage . seriously go pick up a history book as to why volunteers from different nations would go to fight in another countries war , this happens all the time ."
11937,"death . lots of it . and then we'll find out if our species deserves to survive or not , depending on if nukes start to fly or not ."
11938,what is ?
11939,"all i can say is i hope u remember this point in history . im not discrediting what world war 2 did for world history . but your comparing apples to oranges , but why even bother . seeing how afghanistan and iraq turned out , im not even in the slightest surprised . not for one moment am i gonna act surprised , because everyone just seems to live like everyone from the past . it just keeps repeating . from korea to vietnam and all over south america to africa ; seriously can u not see a bigger red flag in ur face ? why do i even bother ?"
11940,"nothing about what i said is remotely pro russia . what im saying is that based on american history alone , every time we send money and weapons into a region full of conflict . it always influences and empowers the types of people and governments that do bad things when the war is over . doesnt it even strike u curious to why the ukrainian government banned all political parties ? or restricted certain information outlets ? just look at african history and the amount of american weapons/aid led to anything worthwhile for anyone there . afghanistan too ; doesnt anyone have long term memory ? i could care less about russia and what delusions they push . i care about my home and the potential problems stuffing a pretty sketchy government with weapons and money like its a far kid in thanksgiving ."
11941,cool ... and ? it's not like funding and arming militia/governments to counter these so called ' expansions of evil ' did anyone any good . does isis ring a bell ? does boko haram ? sierra leone ? car ? bay of pigs ? guatamala ? seriously ? entirely exact same situations where we gave away means to commit war and just created an even more unstable and explosive environment that leads to so much more suffering down the road . when will we learn ? it's an endless cycle of violence and death . if u don't know what i'm talking about then that's the exact problem i'm trying to show . ignorance . that's what u show so much of .
11942,all i can say is good luck with that kind of thinking . it's not a fairy tale out there and it's a well known fact that russia is gaining ground regardless of losses and is draining the ukrainians of troops . its never as simple as good or evil anymore and have no reason to support either side as they both are equally pieces of work to begin with . i hope u understand the gravity of what we are arming and funding well into the future . it's just said we keep going through this again and again .
11943,wow you guys are circling back to the neo nazi propaganda ? you must be getting desperate .
11944,got some links for that ? i can't find anything .
11945,"they are doing well because at the start russia tried to push basically four fronts . however russia got bogged down because they were never able to establish a fob at the air field like they tried . this is because ukraine knew what was coming and set up a trap for them . that became the mo for ukraine at the start . let them come in and then collapse around them . this worked because russia was never able to get artillery in the area to protect the soldiers . on the eastern front russia already had control of much of the area to start with . now they were able to push deeper because they had artillery to protect their troops . ukraine has two options , seek cover and just hide or withdraw . outside of the steel plant they chose to withdraw to save their forces for a counter attack . russia is unable to do much now because of weapon systems like himars just hitting their supply and command structures . eventually this will lead to ukraine softening up the front and they will be able to punch through the russian lines . the only thing russia can do to stop it would be to just throw massive amounts of bodies at them and just hope for the best ."
11946,well two things 1 ) they aren't really doing that great and 2 ) russia's situation is also a wreck
11947,"are they doing well ??, look at how much land the russians have claimed . it's putins war to lose or negotiate when he's ready , and he doesn't give two shits about what the western nations think . more importantly .. winter is due along with energy crisis , which will severely hurt and impact europes decisions and aid . russia may get ripped on reddit for being useless , but as invaders they've taken most of the eastern cities they were after , and most of the black sea except for odessa . they have made it clear they believe the west is fucking with them and the bloodiest battle is yet to happen when they push for odessa , and if they win that then work their way up the eastern border of moldova ( non nato ) where they have separatists and moldova has no control of transnistria . ukraine will be landlocked after that ."
11948,"> this is propaganda ! * spins reality wildly to fit their narrative * sure dude , i could offer counterpoints but it's late and no one cares about your pro-russian propaganda anyway ."
11949,how do you know what he did or didnt fully grasp ? quit talking out your dick
11950,oh yeah totally . it's kinda hopeless .
11951,right ? time to move on and ignore .
11952,"very understandable . nobody wins in a nuclear exchange , doesn't matter how small"
11953,it is not an endless war . no war is endless . there is always pause . a nato intervention would not legitimatise anything . youre being silly .
11954,russian murderers killing ukranian citizens with no care . and you complain about the nato bombing of yugoslavia ??? look at what russia is doing to the people of ukraine . it makes natos actions in yugoslavia look benevolent in comparison . you're a fucking hypocrite .
11955,"there's nothing in the treaty that prevents countries from saying "" we should intervene here "" but there's no requirement for any nation to participate in an offensive war if they don't want to . that's literally the definition of a defensive alliance . are you sure you actually understand what you're talking about ? it sounds like you've never really given this any thought before you started typing"
11956,"can you please find a spine and not be so ruled by fear . there are things that matter more than our individual lives . people like you are what allowed germany to blitz europe , for russia to annex crimea , for israel to continue to settle palestine ."
11957,"i'm at peace with my mortality . i regularly intervene in violent situations when i witness them . when someone put a gun to my head i told them to pull the trigger . i do not tolerate bullies , or injustices i witness . because i am not a coward ."
11958,"russia doesnt have a thousand intercontinental ballistic missiles . the ussr stock has not been completely refreshed and the payload only has a half-life of ~ 40 years . they focused on short range missile systems and area denial dirty bombs . yeah , sure , russia could decide to blow themselves up for unknown reasons . good luck with that plan . im sure itll teach us all a lesson about how clever russia is ."
11959,"> because they literally carpet bomb everything russia has used long range bombers like two times in the entire war . nothing is getting "" carpet bombed "". > more often than not are being used for terrorism on civilians believing that russia is choosing to launch missiles that cost $ 3m each at random targets to "" terrorize civilians "" instead of at military targets is truly one of the most insane and out of touch things people have perpetuated throughout this war . very few things say , "" i've had my brain completely melted by propaganda "" more than that . at the same time , russia is constantly running out of cruise missiles and cannot make more , so according to very sane redditors , they're wasting irreplaceable weapons on targets that have absolutely no significance to the war . completely and utterly insane ."
11960,they can make all propaganda they want . actually retaking it is another completely different matter .
11961,so you wish for humanity to suffer ?
11962,"but we are also comparing apples to oranges here as well . it is not the case that all those countries are similar and have similar outcomes . while we like to pretend that "" america interfering = america bad "", it is unfair and untrue to the us . assuming we take your argument to the extreme . usa shuts off from the world and starts focusing inwards . ok , china gains control of most of sea . russia exerts influence over most of europe . then what ? china and russia is going to play nice with the usa ? or they are going to use their influence the same way usa is using their influence to fuck over them ? where do you think usa prosperity comes from ? it comes from being interconnected into a global trading system where they are the top dog . if us loses that position and influence , things are going to get worse , not better . then again , fuck me i am not an international politics major or any sort of researcher on this , what i am saying is full of shit . let me read more about this ."
11963,""" let's stop supporting ukraine "" when they are defending their territory from russian aggression would benefit russia immensely . therefore , * distinctly * pro-russian . your other examples basically are about funding extremist guerilla fighters , not a sovereign nation with the backing of the vast majority of first world nations . you're full of bullshit and i'm pretty sure you know it ."
11964,"calling bs here . the ukrainian government did not ban all parties , only the ones heavily supported by russia as well as the communist party . any normal country should do that as well . as to your other argument , usa has supported south korea , west germany for example , which turned out not too bad , has it ? also , you do sound like you are on russian payroll . stop mudding the waters with your nonsense ."
11965,"i mean that isn't the case with europe though is it ? the us involved itself with european powers during the second world war , supporting them with money and weapons . i believe the system the us government is going with in providing assistance to ukraine is modeled after that with britain - the lend lease agreement . those were quite successful in stabilizing europe powers and leading to long periods of peace ."
11966,"a yes , that is why the russians are forcibly conscripting , because they are winning ."
11967,"the azov battalion which westerners have been cheering for has 2 nazi insignia in their logo , nazi black sun and the nazi ss inspired logo . many ukrainians praises nazi collaborator stepan bandera , sees him as a hero even though his troops murdered thousands of jews in babyn yar . they have statues and streets named after stepan bandera . both russian wagner nazis and the many nazis in ukraine can go to hell"
11968,"check this out : "" misinformation about wali's record has been circulating online for weeks including claims that he was the deadliest sniper in the world and held a record for the longest-distance kill shot ."" "" wali who joined ukraine's defence along with another canadian veteran who goes by the nickname "" shadow "" said he's not the deadliest sniper in the world and holds no records . just a few weeks ago , he said , he was working as a computer programmer in canada and wasn't actively training ."""
11969,"holding off a major push on your capital , allowing only marginal gains in the east and retaking ground near kharkiv and increasingly in the south against a military far larger and theoretically better equipped than your own is not doing that great ? sure they lost quite a bit of territory in the first two weeks of the invasion but since then the russians have given up a good chunk of their gains in exchange for marginal progress in the east . people looked at the order of battle and gave the ukrainian's days to weeks before they collapsed , here we are 5 months later and russia looks like after taking two mid size cities in the donbass they are losing what little momentum they had . if you define doing great as having won the war already and pushed russia backed to its own borders sure they haven't done that but all things considered their performance has been fantastic , we'll see how ukraine does in the next few months to see what they're really capable of ."
11970,theyre doing significantly more well than anyone expected .
11971,"they really aren't . i don't know why western news outlets makes it seem like they're beating russia but ukraine is not . they're barely hanging on . if russia wasn't so corrupt than ukraine would have fell months ago . as much as i want them too , ukraine isn't winning . russia will win because they have the numbers ."
11972,"come now . russia invaded with the aim of taking all of ukraine , and since lost nearly everything in west ukraine since . you talking about a push for odessa ? with what ? ww2 equipment ? they going to send wave after wave of men , heedless of the demographic issues that russia has been having ? both russia and the us at this point are tired and weakened . this war will ruin russia in the same way that iraq and afghanistan did the us . let the ghosts of the cold war pass into history where they belong ."
11973,what's pro-russian propaganda ? that russia didn't bomb the power and water utilities ? it all reminds me of back in 2003 when i was trying to tell americans online back then that saddam didn't have wmd's . back then i was called a terrorist sympathizer for it . i get a chuckle out of it
11974,"the same thing is called "" collateral damage "" when your folks are doing it and "" genocide "" when your enemies are . of course the media you trust paint russia and nato in different colors . i don't even blame you for that , that's the bubble you live in and you root for your side . but i'm familiar with both bubbles , and i don't find mariupol to be worse than mosul ."
11975,"serbia was bombed under nato command , not by individual countries . therefore , "" defensive alliance "" is a lie . it's a tool of us policy . and don't be a jerk ."
11976,"it's not fear , it's mind . and if you're as righteous as you pretend to be , you should expand that list ."
11977,"listen bucko . you sound like you're talking a high fantasy here . you might not be a coward , but let me tell you one thing , there's nothing more cowardly then living a fake reality on the internet ."
11978,take a look at batman over here 
11979,future school shooter
11980,"you can "" rather "" whatever you want kid , you can't even imagine the horors and loses which will be caused by escalation of conflict in ukraine to ww3 level . only fools and mad scumbags could wish to escalate conflict even further . if you want to die so much can always join that foreign mercenaries and dig your own grave in another battle for someone else's money ."
11981,then youre more evil than any of the people you hate .
11982,"the definition of carpet bombing is a large area bombardment done in a progressive manner to inflict damage in every part of a selected area of land. you dont need bombers for this , artillery can be just as viable and if you follow any news about the war youll know ru has been doing exactly this to all fronts since basically the start . so yes , basically everything is being carpet bombed . you have a litany of examples of kalibr missiles hitting residential areas , or the mall strike recently . while im sure some missiles hit high value targets its not nearly a 100 % hit rate . using these resources to inflict moral damage is an effective tool to try and wither the enemy down . if your point is that ru wont waste the rare missiles on civilian targets then youre making the case that all the strikes on civilians were fuck ups , meaning their targeting is shit . terror and demoralization is a part of war . ru has always been about wining by being able to lose more than their enemy and chug along ."
11983,""" with no sign at all of retaking those lands "" so i post that they're starting a counter offensive now . regardless of the lands they retook near kyiv during russian "" strategic retreat "" from the northern regions . which you ignore . ( whose believing propaganda now ) and you call it propaganda . i wonder what putins ass tastes like . care to enlighten me ?"
11984,"no , i would hope we have the collective wherewithal to not launch nukes . but i don't think avoidance/kicking the can down the road does us any good . if we're willing to nuke ourselves we deserve extinction ."
11985,all i can say . is it's just the same issue again and again . a conflict arises and the usa arms/funds a government or militia force to fight the forces of ' evil ' time and time again . only to find that said force isn't the fairy tale it was painted out to be and becomes another problem in itself well down the future . good luck is all i can say now . don't say i didn't warn everyone just like with iraq and many other conflicts in recent memory .
11986,"let ukraine defend ukraine . we have bigger problems at home . and funding and arming a corrupt government isnt helping anybody here . its sad as hell . but we need to regroup and understand what is going on . americas division is a serious issue that loads of people are downplaying . like i said , if we truly believed russia is a as corrupt and eroding as everyone on reddit believes , wouldnt a ukrainian insurgency be able to intensify that decay ? i thought russia is collapsing ? i just want american attention on the home front that is severely growing in intensity and as a sizable threat to democracy . ukraine isnt a nato country , sucks but its reality many countries around the world deal with too . the world is a cruel and brutal thing , but countries annexing and invading others is nothing new in human history . and like ive been saying for the hundredth time . we have bigger issues at home ."
11987,"south korea isnt so pretty either . entirely a government that is inept and corrupt , remember as soon as 2014 ferry disaster showed just how recent the south korea government was a joke . this blind devotion is horrific ; russia isnt the only government or platform that can create propaganda . people dont realize how stupid sending weapons of any kind to any country during conflict is . it never ends good . even with the korean war"
11988,"that was an entirely different scale of a conflict . people underestimate the size of world war 2 and the sheer amount of world war the actual name carried . that is just comparing apple to oranges to a conflict like this , that has no place in a discussion like this . world war 2 is a beast of its own . this is just madness ."
11989,exactly . i hate how people feel they always have to pick a side in global conflicts . as if both sides being extremely problematic can't be the case . people on this site are so hardheaded that they will run apologetics for fucking nazis . ridiculous .
11990,""" marginal gains "" i guess means losing an entire province and most of donetsk province ... interesting ."
11991,"what are you talking about , they already sent some missiles into odessa less than 2 days ago . do you think they've given up , lmao ."
11992,"ok 42 day old russobot . thank you for your story , its pretty interesting ."
11993,"youre declaring finders keepers , losers weepers ? yeah , no , that isnt how territorial disputes are resolved . if nato intervenes , they do so in the best interests of nato . they dont gift whatever land russians have licked to russia . i know , i know , youre going to tell me how putin is all special and he can keep what he wants . but he cant , and he wont . you russians are so delusional , lol ."
11994,"you're being disingenuous because for all your talk of knowing both bubbles , you still show a very clear bias to the one you live in currently . and sorry , are you talking about the battle of mosul ? the battle in which the iraqi government and us forces captured mosul from isis control ? the battle that had half the civilian casualties of the massacre in mariupol and in which only a third came from coalition bombing ? that mosul ? and you think that's as bad as russia wiping out mariupol , killing 22,000 civilians all by themselves ?"
11995,"yea , nato can decide to be proactive , that doesnt change the fact that its a defensive alliance . and literally the whole world backed this action except for russia and china . i'm not a jerk to point out that you don't seem to have a clue what you're talking about . the alliance forces countries to act in mutual defense , but any country ( whether in the alliance or not ) is free to act in offensive measures at any time . you don't need nato for that . nato just provides a ready made multinational military structure when tye needs of the world align for a common cause ."
11996,"what fake reality ? i have fully acknowledged the potential consequences . i think it's worth it , you do not . your reasons are individualistic , mine are means testing of our species ."
11997,"if you are such a coward why not just allow nuclear capable bullies to dictate global policy . you and everyone you have ever known or loved will die anyway , might as well live by principles in the mean time ."
11998,"to do what is right is not evil . to allow evil to flourish is far worse than standing by your principles , consequences be damned . sorry you are ruled by cowardice over virtues ."
11999,"> so i post that they're starting a counter offensive now . yeah but chances are very unfavorable to them . > regardless of the lands they retook near kyiv during russian "" strategic retreat "" from the northern regions . at the very start of the war ? russian strategy changed completely since then . now they've been doing the "" meat grinder "" strategy that has been extremely effective against the ukrainians . > i wonder what putins ass tastes like . care to enlighten me ? oh , you're just a clown . a pity i've lost my time trying to make a serious debate with a dumbass ."
12000,the russian federation acts according to its own principles and virtues . they will use nukes to defend their people as a matter of principle .
12001,because it's completely false ?
12002,"support of ukraine is one of the few issues that has bipartisan support . again , your arguments come straight from the russian troll farm playbook ."
12003,"straw men on straw men , and nothing precludes supporting ukraine and addressing problems at home . just stop ."
12004,"land lease played a crucial role in stopping hitler . it was american made steel , copper , gunpowder , gasoline , rubber for tank tracks , gears , vehicles , antibiotics , etc etc etc . the war is never good for anyone , but when it hits and there is clearly an aggressor and a victim , the choice is obvious ."
12005,"ok , but clearly your first paragraph is wrong in that the us's military and financial power did assist in stabilizing european powers and lead to an era of peace . just because it was a far larger conflict doesn't mean it has no relevance here ."
12006,"russia already controlled most of that lushank and a large part of donetsk before the war . and i already said russia took a lot of territory in the first couple weeks , but ukraine has since gained back more than they have lost in the east , far more . but people that want to look at the overall situation in the most negative light focus on two medium size cities in the east that the russians spent the last two months focusing the majority of their forces to take and ignore all the ground ukraine made up north of kharkiv , in some cases pushing all the way to the russian border , and the increasing gains down south . that doesn't even get into russia abandoning the entire front near kyiv and retreating all the way through belarus back to russia . obviously losing severdonetsk and lysychansk is not positive for ukraine . you know where the front line in the east was before february 24 ? it was few kilometers outside of severdonetsk . popasna and izyum they took nearby are even smaller cities and took months to take as well . so if you take the front line a couple weeks after the invasion where they stabilized after the initial russian push russia has taken 4 cities in the east all with a population of 100,000 or smaller . in a country with 44 million people in it . meanwhile both their attacks against ukraine's largest cities have been pushed back and then completely stalled in one case , kharkiv , and completely abandoned for the other , kyiv . i find it interesting that most people that say ukraine is doing poorly want to focus on the east and ignore al the other fronts , ones where ukraine is doing far better and not only repulsing attacks but then regaining ground . obviously it would be even better if ukraine wasn't losing any ground anywhere or had never lost any in the february 24th invasion but looking at the situation as it is today and the overall trends things look pretty favorable for ukraine . their victory is not certain , we'll see if the next few months they can take back more heavily defended russian territory but the rough outline i gave above is why many analysts are now hopeful ukraine can make substantial gains and get close to pre february 24th borders . we'll have to see what happens but the next time ukrainian loses in the east seem so bad literally zoom out on a map and look at the overall picture and who's been taking ground from who overall in the last few months . things are not as bleak for the ukrainians as some think ."
12007,"and the entire kherson oblast , most of zaporizhzia , and chunks of kharkiv and mykolaiv oblasts as well . its about 25 % of ukraines territory prior to the 2014 civil war . theyve also lost over to 40 % of their population since then . from refugees and russian annexation . id also add that russia isnt even mobilized , theyre still solely using volunteers in btgs rather than their standard military structure . as to them its still a military operation rather than a war , legally speaking . similar to most of the wests military excursions in the preceding few decades ."
12008,yeah . flinging projectiles at random cities . the us did/does that pretty often as well . but we all know how that all turned out .
12009,i think that was more like simple terrorism than any sort of serious tactical decision making
12010,"any time , tovarish . i can also offer assistance with pointing out where these countries are on the globe for you . has fox news showed you yet ?"
12011,""" mine are means testing of our species "" i won't bother criticising the obvious mistakes in this sentence , but listen to yourself . who do you think you are ? to quote toy story , you are a redditor ."
12012,"orban doesn't want kyiv to win , there's a difference . thing is , nobody cares what orban wants . he's been such a goddamn nuisance they're trying to get rid of the individual eu veto ."
12013,kyiv doesn't have to win . they just have to not lose . same as north vietnam and afghanistan . even putin can't withstand never ending losses .
12014,he looks like this goa'uld who could not stop eating . don't remember the name . personality seems to match also .
12015,"just another case of orban pushing russian memo , might be a sign that putin wants to end the war soon , especially considering that it's us - russia talks he mentioned , russia keeps talking about how it's russia vs . the west , one would think ukraine is a territory and not a country in their eyes . either way orban is a whoring scum ."
12016,i bet orbans phone is filling up with angry text messages from putin because he called it a war and not a special military operation 
12017,"im becoming more and more positive this dude is on putins payroll . now im all for stopping the war , but this dude seems sketchy"
12018,"hungary and belarus , putin's bitches"
12019,"and orban is a disgrace to europe , the sole idea of thinking about this dictator and his lies being part of europe turns my stomach out . disgusting"
12020,"russian puppet , go fuck yourself ."
12021,"translation : i will not be able to win next election without papa putin sending shittone of cash to hungry and the way war is going , he either will not be around or will not have two potatoes to share with his pocket dictators please let finish the war , pretend it never happen so i can keep drugging hungry back to stalins time where i come from ."
12022,"orbn is a loser , and an embarrassment to the european union . hungary politically and culturally is not living up to the standards of the european union ."
12023,that means that kyiv can definitely win .
12024,"sorry , but why would the us need to talk to putin ? the us is the arms supplier . ukraine is the invaded sovereign state ."
12025,biden purposely said talk to kyiv long ago . russia will not get an audience the us . not worthy .
12026,"first lukashenko , now orban parroting the ceasefire line . this is obviously putin sending them out to float the line in public . they must be desperate for a deal . but the us has not negotiated once for ukraine and they aren't about to start now . all they are is an arms supplier . russia needs to understand that . they need to face kyiv or nothing . also , orban is a disgrace , a confirmed fifth column for the west . i wish there is a way to kick him out of the eu and nato . if he wants to shill and disrupt for russia so much theb he needs to realign with them and stop taking eu resources and having nato support . they need to find a way to circumvent him asap ."
12027,"he means "" russia , please come to us "". it is time for the eu to stop all support for hungary ."
12028,putin's puppet in hungary wouldn't say this if ukraine couldn't win ........
12029,i still dont understand how my country managed to get him in office again . its embarrassing to call myself hungarian .
12030,""" hungary president is an open fascist : supports putins murderous invasion of ukraine """
12031,"the whole objective from the beginning wasn't for kyiv to win , but for russia to lose . we were prepared to support the ukrainians back when everyone ( even us ) thought they would overrun kyiv in days and we would be funding an insurgency . it's developed significantly since then once the ukrainians have shown that they wouldn't just roll over , but the original goal never changed . > we want to see russia weakened to the degree that it cant do the kinds of things that it has done in invading ukraine, defense secretary lloyd austin said at a news conference in poland , following his secretive trip to kyiv with secretary of state antony blinken . it had already lost a lot of military capability and a lot of its troops , quite frankly , and we want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability. ([ source ]( it's a punishment and a message . you don't invade another nation in a landgrab while threatening nuclear war . if russia is allowed to ' win ', this basically encourages everyone to get nukes , and will make the west seem even weaker after the debacle in afghanistan . basically guarantees even more war as nations like china and iran take advantage of the power vacuum ."
12032,another pimple on mankind's ass .
12033,"orban needs to decide who's side he's on . if it isn't ours then he can join russia and belarus and suffer the consequences . same goes for turkey , getting pretty sick of their "" playing both sides "" shit when they're meant to be an ally ."
12034,"russia can't be trusted with any talks , they have time and again violated any agreements ."
12035,"yes . and long range himars should come into play , just to test if ukraine cant win"
12036,orban can go suck donkey dick
12037,"now when russia is losing it activated the "" negotiations ?"" mode . we're gonna here more of this from political and media figures on kremlin's payrol . in reality , russia is only trying to take an "" operational pause "" and regroup and any such treaty will go about as good as any treaty signed with russia before . like syrian cease-fire treaty when russia resumed air strikes 2 hours into cease-fire and only used it to move troops , or the minsk agreements , when russia launched a major offensive on debaltseve right after sigining the treaty . or even the "" grain "" treaty signed two days ago and the next day russia launches rockets on the port of odesa . keep calm and carry on . ukraine is winning this war ."
12038,interesting that the us conservative right have a hard on for this guy .
12039,somebody should remind him about 1956 .
12040,"orban says kyiv can't win , but i think he knows the opposite is true . if it's a stalemate russia loses because a stalemate is unsustainable for russia and entirely sustainable for ukraine when supported by the entire western world ."
12041,"hes russian agent and propagandist . i knew few hungarian people and i have always found them to be interesting , intelligent and fun to be around . its weird how someone like orban could have been even elected , hungary deserves better voice"
12042,""" putin's fascist little lapdog in the west barks when his master says to bark ."" -> more accurate headline"
12043,perhaps orban should hunxit and realign hungary with russia . good luck with that .
12044,he is a russian asset . and the part of him not owned by russia is owned by china . unfortunately there is no way to kick them out of the eu
12045,orban will be in dallas to talk to cpac this august 7 to promote fascism to fascist traitors . there are some fcked up people in america .
12046,putin's little bitch relays his master's message . so glad we don't have one of those anymore .
12047,time for hungary to decide if they want to be in nato and eu or not . happy to dispense with them if not .
12048,"this is the best tl;dr i could make , [ original ]( reduced by 86 %. ( i'm a bot ) ***** > ukraine has a "" significant potential "" to advance its forces on the battlefield and needs to increase the intensity of its attacks on russian forces , ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy said in his nightly address on july 21 . > the resolution recognizes that russia's actions , including forced deportations to russia and the killing of ukrainian civilians in mass atrocities , constituted genocide against the people of ukraine . > the resolution calls on the united states , along with nato and european union allies , to support the government of ukraine to prevent further acts of russian genocide against the ukrainian people and supports tribunals and international criminal investigations to hold russian political leaders and military personnel accountable . ***** [** extended summary **]( | [ faq ]( "" version 2.02 , ~ 660996 tl;drs so far ."") | [ feedback ]( "" pm's and comments are monitored , constructive feedback is welcome ."") | * top * * keywords *: ** forces**^1 ** russian**^2 ** ukraine**^3 ** ukrainian**^4 ** military**^5"
12049,so it looks like russia is ready to talk ...
12050,like anyone has time to talk to him
12051,whatever hes saying appears as if it was planted by putin himself ..
12052,fuck this eggplant of a man .
12053,just another world class dipshit to ignore .
12054,fascist propaganda . meh .
12055,"that's just stupid . the rus are outmatched , humiliated and entirely immasculated . putin is clearly a doddering fool who's doomed his nation to generations of weakness and poverty . they're so so bad at propaganda ."
12056,wow russia is really feeling it if they are forcing all their puppets to pressure ukranian allies for a peace settlement . the russians are quite literally admitting they cant win against ukraine .
12057,"why does orban hate ukraine so much ? when did ukraine invade his country , or threaten to do so ? didnt he cite zelenskyy as one of his enemies when giving his election victory speech a couple of months back ? apart from russian gas , whats in this for him ?"
12058,if kyiv can't currently win then the help given to them should increase until they can .
12059,embarrassment to nato and the eu
12060,"bitch please , after we take out putin and luka , you're next ."
12061,orban is a fox on the chicken hut . another puppet of putin .
12062,"orban is a disgrace to the hungarian people , and has his nose stuck so far up putin's ass it'll never come out again . the eu needs to unilaterally shut orban down , stop any and all funding for hungary immediately , and make membership much tougher to achieve for countries waiting to join , with a provision that they can only join if they agree to waive the "" unanimous vote "" rule and agree to accept "" majority vote "" for expulsion , in case of misconduct . the eu fucked up when they assumed countries like poland and hungary wouldn't misbehave badly ."
12063,"putin is using his one nato lapdog to create a balanced impression of an opportunity for peace , sidestepping ukraine . the himars must * really * be sticking it to him ."
12064,"orban is a fascists fascist , so not surprising ."
12065,those tides will turn once they're equipped with fighter jets . i'm just waiting for when the us hands them some less but still highly qualified drones as well . absolutely no chance they give them a predator drone but there's some others in the arsenal that would surely help .
12066,ukraine gave up nuclear weapons for guaranteed autonomy promised by russia and we see the results of that . russia annexed its territory . for oil and gas reserves .
12067,russia deserves zero security guarantees since it's proven to not honor any of theirs . i'd be perfectly fine if russia is broken up into city states .
12068,russia has already lost . their humiliating shit show has the world laughing at them
12069,putin's whore is again spreading messages from his kremlin master
12070,i think i'll trust the us and uk intel over the 155 billion gdp country's intel .
12071,"this means russia believes that ukraine can win . at this point , orban is a mouthpiece for russia . russia wants a peace agreement . russia wants to cement whatever territory they can steal from ukraine right now , before ukraine starts really driving them out ."
12072,we should have nothing to say to russia . ukraine is not the united states nor nato . ukraine can speak for itself .
12073,putin's puppet says what ?
12074,kiev cant lose .
12075,f pootie puppet orban .
12076,how can he get up putins arse with a head that size .
12077,well yeah if one former soviet republic can fend off the big bad bear then suddenly orban's dictatorship starts looking awfully fragile as well .
12078,i see putins memo to this turd came in
12079,"so understanding that russia always lies about everything , this means they are begging for talks because they are about to lose ."
12080,im surprised he could talk with putins cock in his mouth .
12081,"so why would the russians want to talk ? are they already paying too high a price for "" victory ""?"
12082,he needs to get kicked out of the ec
12083,someone should shut that guy up .
12084,clownish dictator needs attention
12085,only talks could be ukraine - russia .
12086,"what a joke of a person . bought , paid for and gift wrapped by russian blood money ."
12087,oooorrrr you can suck your own nut orban you proto-fascist fuck .
12088,"hes a natzi , just look up how he ( in not so little words ) believes in a pure race ."
12089,fuck this guy seriously
12090,fucjk this guy . his rhetoric elsewhere sounds an awful lot like ethnic cleansing
12091,why is this ape even in news ? he is putins fan boy . orban will be kicked from eu imho .
12092,orban is the joe manchin of the eu .
12093,i'm sure he is another russian puppy
12094,this sounds like ukraine is in fact winning and russia is trying to get them to throw in the towel .
12095,they did . putin tore it up
12096,is that little bitch talking again ? his master poetler must really be in trouble then . time to push harder
12097,"shouldn't russia be talking to ukraine , not the united states , about any of this ?"
12098,one more sign that ukraine is winning
12099,orban has got to stop sucking russia's dick
12100,to hell with that little dictator
12101,"this guy is really a true motherfucker , a black hole in world society . i dont wish him well ."
12102,"i think we should do it ! and i think we should give them every security guarantee they want ! ... i think we should then bomb the living shit out of them a week later . you know , as per the usual russian playbook on "" guarantees "" and "" agreements ""."
12103,"fuck this putin dick-riding , hungarian nationalist mole that wants all of the benefits of eu membership but none of the responsibility ."
12104,orban ! go fuck yourself ! you are a shame for europe .
12105,"ignoring all the propaganda , when you have this guy , china and the puppet in belarus pushing for peace and ceasefire you know russia is losing . their actions show weakness and theyare trying to break the wests unity on this . oh and the us and russia were due to have talks in feb but invaded instead"
12106,kyiv has been winning since day 1 .
12107,85 % of their gas coming from russia = putin has them by the ass
12108,why the fuck would the us and russia have talks when russia is at war with ukraine ? zelensky doesn't take orders from biden . this is pure deflection . the belligerent parties are russia and ukraine .
12109,hungarians are brainwashed in same way as russians are ...
12110,are they watching the same war ?
12111,well not to worry - putin will be eyeing up hungary soon anyway
12112,this is what all the trump supporters will say at work on monday . [ relevant ](
12113,"american conservatives will be parroting this by tuesday afternoon , i guarantee it ."
12114,"is this different from the earlier piece about putin's favorite side bitch proclaiming the sanction weren't working ? either way , if orban is [ squealing like a piggie ]( about the need for peace - you know the sanctions and us made weapons are wreaking havoc on russia ."
12115,"he would say that , me . putie lite ."
12116,"good idea , won't work"
12117,orban is a wannabe putin . hungarians should be smart and overthrow him before he drags their country into sanctions and a war they cant win .
12118,look at me . i'm relevant .
12119,"... the us is not an active participant in the conflict , so that makes no sense at all ."
12120,hungarians need to get this fucker out of office any way possible . he's a stain on the human race .
12121,what a total piece of human garbage
12122,"hey q , i think we found the global cabal that you have been blathering on about ."
12123,orban can shut the fuck up
12124,we come for you orban your days are numbered ...
12125,not with an attitude like that babyfascist orban .
12126,well its a good thing then that the outcome of this war is not reliant on the opinion of this clown .
12127,"i mean fu orban , you murdering pos . you dont have a say ."
12128,"viktor orban , darling of american fascists and putins eu spokesmodel . time to cut off his money supply ."
12129,go fuck yourself orban .
12130,"fuck you orban . hungary , grow some balls and get rid of this weak , pathetic man ."
12131,i can't wait for one day hungary to get invaded . let's see what tune he says then ?
12132,"yeah , let's listen to europes last dictator . him and his dictator buddies seem so rational . / s"
12133,aye little puppet
12134,he has been bought and paid for by putin . it's insane that this corrupt country is in nato and the eu .
12135,orban can go f himself
12136,"orban is a nazi , he needs to shut the fuck up ."
12137,fuck this cunt . throw hungry out of the eu . absolute fascist .
12138,what else would the leader of a neo-fascist state say ( thats what im calling hungary from now on until they unfuck themselves from their authoritarian bullshit ).
12139,"djeez , what a surprise coming from putin's official lapdog & bitch ..."
12140,ah yes the russian puppet theatre ! must see tv !
12141,orban is a neo nazi traitor with putin . he speaks for putin and so he almost always lies . huge shame the hungarians re-elected him but putin runs their media and has been bombarding that country with fascist lies for years .
12142,just a mouthpiece for kremlin crap
12143,"problem here is , putin is a trained kgb agent . taught to deceive , manipulate etc .. he is not a diplomat . giving in , concessions or withdrawing would mean a loss for him . kgb are not trained for that"
12144,"hope orban burns in hell with putin . old saying,the tail dont wag the dog and orban aint even the flea on the tail . sorry to the swine of the world but he looks like a little piggy ."
12145,everyone say it with me the russian government lies .
12146,at least when orban opens his fat mouth we find out what russia actually wants
12147,seems like russia is getting desperate when they coerce their primary eu pawn to raise this issue .
12148,1 . nobody cares about orban's opinion 2 . hungary is playing a dangerous game in the eu 3 . we have already destroyed 52 % of all ruzzian tanks and nearly 160k soldiers killed or wounded . 4 . lend lease deliveries have not started yet
12149,stop giving this nobody attention
12150,"russia will never be a superpower . they lack morals , ( emotional ) intelligence and much more . only with violence and death without any other prospect to win over the hearts of the majority . nobody is like ; russia is a good example ( in any way ). dont bother going against the us context , they already did it regardless of how shitty they have been and are ( lol ). idiotic aspirations of leaders trying to pursue world domination . fools ."
12151,this is what all these nationalist populist politicians would be saying if they were in power like orban . it is/was in russias playbook to prop up reactionary populists in western countries to divide and destabilize them while being apologetic to russia . thats why every one of them has dirty russian money funding some of their campaign .
12152,orban can't win.fuck him .
12153,"your silence will be remembered , hungary ."
12154,ukraine calls on eu/us talks on hungary !
12155,putin is finished . his successor will likely be even dumber and more aggressive .
12156,"this guy is on crack . putin doesnt want or seek security guarantees . he wants expansion , territory and ukraine is in his way . go back to your dracula tourism and stop talking thru your ass ."
12157,orban is like lukashenko putins girl
12158,he same nazi orban saying the other day that he does not want racial mixing in hungary
12159,yeah i don't know about this take . things look pretty stalemated to me . no idea which side can win . also : what a weird war to be having in 2022 . air power hardly a factor . artilliary huge factor . it's a wonder they aren't digging trenches too .
12160,what a cuck ! a brain dead zombie cuck to boot .
12161,"fuck off , ya fascist . notice how putin and his bootlickers are always asking for talks between russia and * america ,* though the guys they're actually at war with are the ukrainians ? that's effectively a sign that they don't recognise ukraine's authority over its own country ."
12162,"orbans a degenerate monster . that said , theres an easy end to this war any time vlad wants it : pull all troops out of ukraine , give back all separatist territory , and return all kidnapped ukrainians . then foot the bill for reconstruction and pay restitution to the tens of thousands of ukrainians whose family members russia killed . finally , allow all members of the russian military to be tried by the hague for war crimes . id say putin should face trial as well , but if hes going to make good on everything else , i think the world would let him continue to hide in his moldy mansion for his few remaining days before the oligarchs kill him ."
12163,hungary is stupider than i thought for electing this facist . when oh when will the old people die off that elect these turds .
12164,"lol , i love this . "" ukraine , go sit in the corner while the adults talk about how this war is going to end ."" ukraine is getting the developing nation treatment . seriously though , i don't love this , but it's how 1st world countries work"
12165,"* so , barzini will move against you first . he'll set up a meeting with someone that you absolutely trust , guaranteeing your safety . and at that meeting , you'll be assassinated *"
12166,winning is not the point for the us . bankrupting russia and causing them to expend all their weaponry is the goal . id think this orban guy could figure that out .
12167,"as a friend with hungary , are you ok ?"
12168,"and what exactly does this moron think will happen ? the us won't tell ukraine to surrender , nor will they stop supplying them with ordinance , so ... what ? does orban think that vlad the despoiler is getting lonely , and needs to have a chat ?"
12169,hahaha he's getting desperate that his dictator-daddy is in trouble .
12170,boo you whore
12171,russia can get all the security it needs by not starting wars . and can end any war they're involved in by going back home .
12172,orban is putins plant obvi
12173,fuck this guy man
12174,"good good , putin getting nervous that ukraine will push into russia and starting fucking him . keep it up lads ."
12175,"what a dimwit . an embarrassment for europe . orban , his party and politics , sucking putins everything ."
12176,orbn can go fuck himself .
12177,im pretty sure they are winning right now . russia sucks .
12178,a lot of europeans would like to swap hungary with ukraine .
12179,get rid of this guys already we need someone with a brain
12180,fuck orban and putin .
12181,"at this point i'd say if anyone can't win it's putin , orban's bosom buddy and that's why he wants talks , cause he'd go down with him ."
12182,"as leader of a country firmly on putler's hit list , he'd better hope that kyiv can win ..."
12183,"so , what orban wants is a border with a russia controlled state ? and then try to keep the hungarian "" race "" not to intermix with russians ? lol ... these nationalists are ridiculous ..."
12184,fuck off you slimy pos
12185,this fuckin guy is getting very chatty all of a sudden . how is his bluster getting promoted through various outlets so heavily ?
12186,"gee , i wonder what is he going to do with sweden-finland nato bid ?"
12187,when your crazy shouting at tv uncle starts doing politics
12188,"ring ring hello this is orban , how can i help you? victor , i sent u script on secret kgb telegram grup , yon chave to make appointments with your media and read everything from the script ok putin and can you send me more money ? brussels doesnt give me covid money they are giving everybody but me? yes u can have , but u only get rubbles "
12189,russia has thrown all their men and materiel into this bullshit war and are quickly running out of steam . they dont have any more steel to build new tanks or replace old cannon barrels . nor are they getting any more computer chips for guidance systems . theyre launching rounds that cant hit the broad side of a barn while the us is supplying smart artillery systems that are systematically destroying key ammo dumps and command centers behind enemy lines . and instituting a draft would be tantamount to russia admitting theyre losing and possibly cause civil unrest . mi6 just said russias war effort has been an epic fail . [ source ]( so its not surprising that putins stooges are talking this settlement nonsense now . putin knows its all going south .
12190,who cares what a neo-nazi thinks .
12191,nice to see hes spouting the same garbage talking points as american conservatives
12192,evil putin loving sockpuppet .
12193,"as a lithuanian it blows my mind that not that long ago we would look up to hungary with all the fancy automotive factories , higher salaries and so on . i guess this is a good example how shit can start going down hill really quickly if you don't take good care of your country by voting and calling out pieces of shit like orban . to all hungarians still with a brain - i wish you all the best dealing with this shit ."
12194,"orban , i have an important message to you : go suck a dick"
12195,fuck orban .
12196,"that dude is such a cancer...yet it is a reminder that in a lot of countries such people like him are getting very close to be elected president . we managed to not have marine le pen in france , once again , but every 5 years since two decades we are walking on a thin layer of ice . that kind of leaders are a serious threat ."
12197,"now who would listen to your corrupt opinion ? us is not in this war , dummy . russia can talk to the sovereign nation of ukraine that they invaded . meanwhile , more missles and new progressive weapons coming your way russia"
12198,no one cares what a shitstain like orban thinks . he needs to sit down and shut the fuck up .
12199,orban is a russophile . why doesnt he move there .
12200,"i can never understand this guy , he must know by now how garbled his words are when his mouth is full of putaint ."
12201,"the us and nato still have to many toys to share with kiev that take more training than what they delivered so far . e.g . the usa could easily hand over ukraine m1 abrams tanks or artillery that is more difficult to transport than triple 7 . also they have long range ammunition they haven't shared yet , fighter jets , helicopters , air defense systems . ukraine basically is as strong as nato wants it to be and russia is aware of that leverage . so right now , they enabled ukraine to obliterate russian ammo depots and slowly advance , if ukraine is able to take down russian supply trains lines , things might change quickly ."
12202,"neither can you , viktor . you're just losing allies without gaining anything , how is that constructive in any way ? just an old autocratic fossil trying very hard to cling to relevancy ."
12203,shut up you stupid nationalist we know you are lying .
12204,"ukraine is fighting for their freedom . russia can't match that motivation and will lose . the support from the world is strong , stronger as putler . other countries also are looking to take territory back . kyiv can win !"
12205,"right , because russia can be trusted to keep any agreement or treaty they sign ..."
12206,"the only reason hungary are in the eu is to keep them from being another belarus . of course in theory you can't just kick a country out of the eu , but orban really does seem to be the enemy within . time to make them sign up to so much liberal stuff they hate that they leave of their own volition ."
12207,"orban is an idiot . does he not know what happened to russia in afghanistan or to the us in vietnam ? it's totally possible to lose a war , even with superior firepower ."
12208,"that said ; however , russia can lose ."
12209,fuck orban the far right piece of shit . fuck his entire party and all his supporters .
12210,nazi says what ?
12211,"throw them out of nato . its surprising to me , that they are still in nato alliance . why should we defend them ? alot of people there still believe in this dictator ."
12212,they literally just proved yesterday they cant honor any agreements
12213,talks with russia do absolutely nothing and mean absolutely nothing . you have to go no further than a couple of days ago to see that . they bombed the odessa port a day after agreeing not too . they are bad actors pure and simple .
12214,"so russia goes for every inch they can , then the second they stall out they ( via lackey ) try to quit and lock in their gains . what little bitches ."
12215,shudup hungryman .
12216,this nazi can go fuck himself
12217," well , ukraine is actually winning and preparing to destroy the leftovers of russian troop and elaborate the whole territory . russia is already loose this was , and now it will be confirmed in the battlefield . that's why hungry as a miserable slut playing on russians side and begging us and ukraine "" please do not win "". there are two scenarios possible , russia will be defeated and destroyed in ukraine or russians pull back the leftovers of their troops . both scenarios are total loss for russia , it must be destroyed - totally ."
12218,fucking russian lover
12219,"yes , please listen to the dude who's nose is so far up putins asshole there's an audible sound of a nasal bone hitting a pelvic and tail bone ... the dude is literally so chained up inside putin's pocket we have aggreements with russia that have been made a state secret not to be disclosed for around 20 years or so . if someone can be labeled "" not to be trusted "" when it comes to making decisions regarding policies towards russia , that's orban ( and his cronies )."
12220,why should us ( or anyone ) promise ruzzia anything ? they have clearly showed they dont care about the simplest agreement .
12221,heh . why would anyone negotiate when a sovereign country is invaded .
12222,seems like kyiv can win
12223,us and russia should meet and agree to turn budapest into a global waste dump .
12224,nato should accept the invitation to setup a no-fly-zone . putin will back down . another option is giving ukraine missle defense systems from israel and/or from nato . russia doesnt want war with nato and putin wont last very long if the war escalates .
12225,that's what i would call a put(a)in .
12226,kick them out of the eu and nato already .
12227,"orban is really starting to get under my skin . fuck this piece of shit . if he thinks anybody is gonna help his fat lying ass in the future when his head is on the chopping block , i hope someone puts a framed pic of putin in front of him saying heres your help. "
12228,"no one needs kyiv to win , we need russia to lose ."
12229,"the thing is no one is "" winning ""."
12230,"orban's inflated importance is a byproduct of the legislative shortcomings of the eu , i.e . its veto rights . if the eu - same goes for the un really - wouldn't be designed in such a borderline naive way that almost invites obstructionism , literally nobody would even have heard of the name viktor orban . orban is the head of a country that could hardly be any more irrelevant on the world stage - and i'm saying that as someone who dated a hungarian woman , and fell in love with the country & its people . but definitely not with the administration . apart from international conservatives & wannabe fascists maybe , nobody gives a %&$ about your opinion , vikki ."
12231,our puppet from moscow....this guy has always been more friendly with putin than with the eu . the same eu that is giving him and his cronies billions of tax money from all european citizens . cut him off the money and let's see how the hungarians feel when things start to go south because of a lack of funds .
12232,viktor orban - lukashenko light
12233,"russia is at war with ukraine , not the us ."
12234,objective truth is hard to come by .
12235,"actually , i'd go so far as to say you need to rephrase that , orban doesn't want russia to \ _lose\_ , he doesn't really care if kyiv wins or not , there's no skin in the game with him . but he needs the most powerful autocracy that's a very corrupting influence on europe to \ _not\_ lose its influence ."
12236,"using the carrot with this guy sets a dangerous precedent . the idea is that as soon as we stop paying them , orban falls in line . the idea with eu projects is that developing infrastructure helps boost trade , and benefits whole of europe in the long run . which is why you can argue that countries that are net donators to eu coffin also benefit themselves . orban has completely abused this idea . he's lined his and his friends ' pockets with eu money , while being in putin's pocket , all the while getting exempt from gas import and wielding the veto for sanctions . i can't see how he'd be able to keep on playing this game for much longer ."
12237,"orban is wrong , zelensky is right . end of story ."
12238,orban is a fucking dipshit . the world still turns . this is life .
12239,tucker carlson cares .
12240,american republicans do . they absolutely love him . i'm fact the republican youth openly uses orban as and example of what they want for america . our leaving conservative news anchor even did a week of his show in hungary to show how great the country was under orban .
12241,orban's voice . putin's words . russia is trying to find an exit before it's obvious that they are losing .
12242,"orban is basically putin , he just happened to be president in an eu/nato nation that is land locked and surrounded mostly by other eu/nato nations , limiting the shit he can do significantly ."
12243,he cares more about oil prices and his political standing .
12244,"orban does not care whether kyiv wins , he is just afraid of putin's kgb files on him ."
12245,"he won elections not a long time ago...so something else failed there , not only his mind ."
12246,"yes , being stuck in a perpetual conflict means he can't make any new moves . any kind of half assed peace is basically a victory for putin ."
12247,russian is murdering civilians .
12248,vietnam actually went in and wiped the floor with the south vietnamese army .
12249,"nerus ! "" what is this delicious meat ?"" "" chicken !"""
12250,"[ nerus ?]( shaped like a ball , supremely overconfident in themselves and yet utterly subservient to/absolutely reliant upon a more powerful ruler to have any power of their own . i can definitely see the resemblance ."
12251,does ukraine have p90s yet ? seemed like they were effective against culture stealing parasites in fiction . could give it a whirl against the ones in reality !
12252,"every now and then , someone on reddit comments something about a pop-culture show that i grew up watching and loving . i read comments like yours and know that i am not alone ."
12253,thought i was back in stargate subreddit for a sec
12254,i love this comment lol
12255,"nerus , one of the engineers ."
12256,shit ur right
12257,holy fuck he does look like him hahaha ! good catch !
12258,agreed . if the ukrainians keep getting supplies from the west and are willing to keep fighting the russians are eventually going to get exhausted . zelenshye is correct if you let up on the russians now that they will take the opportunity to rearm and regroup and the russians will just come back . the russian goal is the destruction of ukraine as an independent entity . either all at once or in bits and pieces . the russian goal remains the same .
12259,he wants talks with the us because pretending that he was defeated by the us/nato makes the fact that he was defeated by ukraine easier for him to swallow
12260,"> ukraine is a territory and not a country that's exactly what brainwashed would say . this is not an abberation , but the mainstream of the current propaganda ."
12261,russia is pushing this narrative that ukraine has no agency in this . they're also trying to save face because they can't admit that they lost a fight with ukraine .
12262,i mean putin literally said that ukraine wasnt a legitimate sovereign country when the war started . so this is no surprise .
12263,exactly that.most of the russian people i spoke with do not consider ukraine a country.power of their massmedia it\`s just mind boggling .
12264,isn't it hilarious the way they try to spin it ? imagine if in 1940 the axis tried to negotiate with the americans supplying the british instead of the british
12265,"putin knows he's plan to break europe's back won't work . europe could change teams and drop their support for ukraine , but it won't change anything . as long as usa keeps the support , they can bankroll ukraine by themselves . it's not like europe would cutoff of access to ukraine for america either . russia has to figure out something , but they have to talk directly with the us to achieve that ."
12266,"russia wants to "" stop the count "" and keep what ground their invasion force happens to be standing on at the time ."
12267,all conservatives are now russian/chinese puppets .
12268,bet orban doesnt care .
12269,putin probably helped him win an election or 2
12270,"he probably made a deal with putin before the war . if the russian army would have overrun the ukrainian state and the capitulated early on , russia would have incorporated large parts of ukraine and orban got himself a piece of the zakarpattia oblast ( carpatho-ukraine , home to 100.000 ethnic hungarians ) as a reward for being the inside man in eu and nato ."
12271,"also , hungarians need cheap gas . as a western european its easy . i make 2000 euros/month after taxes . 600 for mortage . energy went from 140 to 300/month . i still have 600-800/month left . i also bought a wood pellet stove for 2k to need less gas . if you only make 800/month to start with , these increased gas prices are deadly ."
12272,everything him and lukashenko says comes from kremlin . you can safely assume the opposite is true .
12273,this is confirmation to me that the war is turning and putin is reaching out to its puppets to try and lock in occupied land . this is also a confirmation to me that its time to press the attack and push russia back to their own borders .
12274,not entirely . hungarians are dying in ukraine and we have taken a lot of immigrants from ukraine . just because orban is an ass we are not .
12275,"only two countries in europe i have no desire to visit , and i felt that way since before the invasion ."
12276,he is the reason the rest of the eu is starting the process of getting rid of unanimous votes for majority ones ... massive reprocussions .. so may be like needing 90 % agreement on votes ... but an obvious russian agent being able to veto everything is about to end
12277,"p , "
12278,"just another graying european country grasping out to the so-called glorious past , which in their case means...reaching out to austria-hungary ?"
12279,not even living up to the standards of its old self .
12280,"the end goal for putin would be to bring the us to the table and get concessions from them as well , for example getting the us to redeploy their troops and missiles in europe . the things they could potentially get out of the us are far more valuable to him than anything in ukraine . it's not gonna happen because like you said the us isn't even a party in the conflict no matter how much putin might want them to be . if they want to negotiate it should be with the ukrainian government ."
12281,because orban is putin's bitch and all of them + putin say they are fighting the west because it's easier to sell failling against nato than ukraine .
12282,"because putin wants to believe they are equals to the us . he wants to appeal to the imperialism of both nations and convince the us that him losing this war upsets the "" balance between 2 empires "". what putin fails to see ( as most old people do ) is that not only some rules are changing right now , but the entire game . he thinks the us not negotiating with them right now is a "" sign of disrespect "" and that the us doesn't see russia as its equal , when in fact the us is like "" bruh , you're at war with a peaceful , democratic country ; we're just doing business as we please and our conscience tells us to ""."
12283,"in putins fantasy , its still east versus west , with america being the ruler of the west and russia of the east . putins getting old and nostalgic about the past ."
12284,i'll give the military analysts this one . they said russia would be exhausted by august and so far they look like they are right on the money . now is the time for ukraine to hit them as hard they can .
12285,"for all intensive purposes russia lost this war when they failed to take kyiv , it was suppose to be an inevitability , instead russia's military couldn't accomplish the task and had to pull back , now they are stuck in putin's version of vietnam , there is no way for putin to turn this into a victory unless people are dumb enough to take people like orban's opinion seriously . nato will keep giving ukraine weapons and supplies , the resistance to russian occupation will be indefinite and unending , russia's economy will continue to sink until russia gives up , putin dies , or the state of modern russia goes into total collapse . it's check mate , putin just refuses to acknowledge his own failure , just like every other petty tyrant throughout history . doesn't matter , the longer he draws this out , the more painful it will be for him in the end ."
12286,"on the day when ukraine wins this war , i will get a bottle of champagne , then go to buda castle and pop the bootle as close to orbn's office as police let me . got id'd by them 4 times just the last week , so they can do it the 5th time . fuck orbn ."
12287,"he is the prime minister , not the president . i mean the new president is orbn's bitch . she only took office 3 months ago but already the worst president this country ever had ."
12288,> hungary president isn't the president a woman ?
12289,like their promise to never invade ukraine in exchange for ukraine relinquishing its share of the soviet nuclear arsenal .
12290,"hmm , lets see : morally bankrupt , proudly ignorant , corrupt , greedy , living in a constant state of anxiety that your precarious position of power could topple and crush you beneath its bloated weight if people get sick of you/your financial backers disappear ? yup , just like us conservatives ."
12291,"rightwinger wins and systematically dismantles the ability of people to ever vote him out of office . yeah , so interesting that us republicans worship him . / s"
12292,and revealing . . .
12293,"they do ? i ask this honestly , because while i lack any far right associates , i know people who are definitely more conservative than liberal , and they have as much if a hate boner for putin and anyone that supports him as anyone else i know ... hell , more than some others considering they tend to be the same ones who advocate for direct intervention ... is it fox news or something that likes orban ?"
12294,somebody should remind him about kun bela .
12295,and lose all that sweet eu development money ? not a chance ! the eu should kick them out .
12296,cheap russian energy is all the reason he needs .
12297,definitely . air defense will turn the war dramatically . i was happy to read last week that u.s . is closer to providing war planes .
12298,"honestly that's probably the scariest part of it ( for those outside ukraine ). there's no way putin saves face after this . zelensky is going to go full ulysses s grant during any peace talks and the us is likely to stay out of his way for a number of reasons . the eu (* cough * germany * cough *) has some compelling reasons to push for a brokered deal , but almost everyone ( including lots of germans ) is fed up with russia's shit ."
12299,"oh , you mean the country that has an economy 1/10th of the state of texas ? that one ? lol"
12300,saddam hussein has weapons of mass destruction. - us intelligence
12301,belarus : dont forget about us !
12302,"as long as putin doesn't want to tangle with nato , he won't . orban might be a mouthpiece for putin , but he's also living under the protection that nato affords , which makes him doubly detestable . / hungary might be kicked out , except the other baltic states and turkey would probably not vote against them ."
12303,in what reality could that happen ? everyone in this thread simultaneously things he is losing and he is on the verge of marching across europe it cant be both
12304,absolutely ... this is what the us will look like if they win the mid terms .
12305,"i agree . putin is a like a mafia don , running a kleptocracy . meanwhile bridges , roads and rails , and other public works fall apart because of corruption in the contracting process . that sort of autocrat eventually succumbs to a bullet or cancer . heres hoping its the first ."
12306,they are digging trenches .
12307,"there was a massive network of reinforced trenches in lysychansk alone that even went into the basements of people's homes using them as pre-existing concrete reinforced bunkers . that's why it took so long for the russians to take lysychansk and sevieredonetsk . the ukraine war in the donbass has essentially been the 21st century re-enactment of the western front in world war 1 , you know , only with assault rifles , missile launchers , tanks , and jets , instead of you know , going up and over to charge the enemy's trenches ."
12308,they have been digging trenches since feb 24th ..
12309,stalemate is a win for ukraine militarily considering how outmanned and gunned they are . russia gets to watch its resources and manpower get drained over some dudes ego . they can get fucked and go home at any time
12310,"russian soldiers dug trenches around chernobyl without even knowing how contaminated the ground was . ( apparently that disaster is glossed over in their education ). trenches are very much in use by both sides to help mitigate the risks from artillery strikes . air power should have been a major factor in the conflict , and appeared to be early on , but russia can't maintain their superiority under extreme sanction when most of their tech is reliant on parts they can no longer purchase ."
12311,it's because russia has proven to have an incompetent and outdated military and ukraine has west's support . the longer this goes on the more it goes in favor of ukraine .
12312,the fact that ukraine is still standing means russia is losing .
12313,"as russia burns through all of its cold war equipment , we're going to see the evolution of warfare technology played in reverse ."
12314,it isnt just old people that elect these types of people to run their country . there are plenty of young people who have drank the kool aid . basically they all believe that it is best to have 1 party 1 rule as long as it suits their agendas .
12315,hungary doesnt have free and fair elections
12316,kyiv has been winning since the start
12317,when russia comes to take over your nation a stalemate is victory . i believe ukrainians are being trained on f15's/f-16's and there is talks of giving a-10's to ukraine . i feel like those would both be a bit of game changers for the war . between those and the himars and all the other systems being given to ukraine the tide will turn . ukraine keeps getting stronger and better trained . while on the other hand russia's force will never be as strong as it was on day 1 .
12318,"how could you say something so brave , yet so controversial ?"
12319,orban believes parts of ukraine are hungarian
12320,what do you mean no skin ? there are revanchist movements to unite hungarians under ukraine to hungary . a weakened and split ukraine does benefit nationalist fascist leaning leaders like orban in this case .
12321,"it's not just orban , chinese politicians made a similar comment the other day , calling for peace just as it is starting to become clear that russia's position in ukraine is unsustainable . the entire autocratic world is seeing the once mighty russia collapsing over what should have been a simple annexation , and they are getting nervous . if any country , provided with western weapons , can fight an authoritarian state to a standstill and potentially economic ruin then what is to stop nato from pouring weapons into the hands of , for example , uyghurs ? that is why they are trying to frame this as nato supporting a corrupt ukrainian regime against the interest of the ukrainian people and prolonging a lost cause . they don't care about peace , their only priority is to continue the status quo of dominance of certain authoritarian states , lead by certain authoritarian leaders . and for that to happen russia cannot appear to lose in ukraine ."
12322,"thats a pity , because thats exactly what is happening . of course committing genocide does tend to be a bit off putting for most people "
12323,yeah what exactly is orban's endgame here ? he can fuck off and pull hungary out of nato and the eu if he hates western europe so badly . i'm sure he'll have no problem managing his economy and funding domestic infrastructure when he has to divert all of hungary's budget to stopping russia from annexing hungary
12324,fuck orban with a rake .
12325,and we should not care about what fucker cares about .
12326,"yes , and they had their cpac conference in hungary . americans should wake up to the fact that a frightening number of republicans are swimming in putinismwhich is what this is . some of them believe putin is the leader of the free world , and to them the free world is white , christian , and straight . nevermind the fact that putin believes in nothing beyond himself . his propaganda is tailored specifically toward them , and preys on the gullible and ideologically isolated . it doesn't bode well for the future of the country , especially when our main adversaries for the foreseeable future will be russia and china ."
12327,> republican youth wat
12328,"pretty much , history has shown in recent decades that engaging in an invasion of a country tends to favor the defenders than the invaders ."
12329,"you are forgetting that sanctions apply only to russia , while ukraine get subsidies . the russian economy is tanking and there is no one to bail it out , while the ukraine economy is getting bailed out . furthermore , russian reserves will be used to rebuild ukraine , no one is going to rebuild russia . time does not work for putin . he has a window in which to break ukraine , and if he fails , the tide turns the other way ."
12330,"and considering how little time putin seems to have left , any time spent stalling him is a victory ."
12331,exactly . all they had to do was not lose until the u.s . left .
12332,feast ? i don't take that word lightly .
12333,he is a goa'uld known for his many...appetites
12334,its like they're twins lol
12335,i suddenly have the urge to play my les paul .
12336,"this is like some sort of psychological phenomenon , because the number of this references increased tenfold at least when i started rewatching it , lol ."
12337,[ comments you can hear ](
12338,can you imagine ukrainians and russians getting along after this ? its going to be years
12339,best explanation ive seen .
12340,"i agree , but in reality it wasnt just ukraine ?"
12341,"he wants talks because he thinks he's winning with that strategy . he wants to create a new status quo where he doesn't give any land back and focus on deporting the ukrainians and replacing them with russians . he will call for a cease fire and blame zelensky for being a warmonger . he will hold fake referenda , saying that if they are attacked in the donbass it's an attack on russians and he will up the nuke talks , like he does with crimea ."
12342,"partially , but this war was also supposed to show in this context that he "" defeated the west "" and be a catalyst for putin's new world order he keeps talking about . unfortunately for him , he was very wrong , and he just appears to be missing the plot at this time"
12343,"well technically ukraine most likely would have been defeated militarily already if it wasnt for the continued support of the west . its ukraine ( with western supplies , logistics and sanction pressure on russia ) vs russia pretty much by themselves ."
12344,or that they are people ... sadly downgrading your enemies is very common tactic .
12345,i support the mongol claims on moscow . russia is not a legitimate country by historic standards edit : we can also go back a little in history and assert german claims on konigsberg . im sure putin would love that
12346,"remember that the uk was a bigger military power than the us at the beginning of ww2 , that changed pretty radically in 5 years"
12347,"the main issue is with usa losing support , not eu losing support lol ."
12348,"bruh are you listening to yourself ? the second that happens the entire western world would roll up on hungary and insta butt fuck us , no sensible country would ever recognize that territory . orbn is a piece of shit and corrupt as hell but hes not this stupid ."
12349,"sorry but it was proven many times at this point that the "" cheap russian gas for hungary "" is a lie . szijjrt just went to moscow to beg for more gas and we are paying around 1000 huf/m3 for it ( 2,5 ), while the price on ttf is 1,5/m3 . though they made the new gas deal state secret , we are able to make quite accurate calculations looking at trade numbers , according to those hungary pays market price for russian gas , just with a 2 month delay . that's why orbn's government announced the de facto cancellation of their "" rezsicskkents "" ( price cap on ultilities ) and that's why gas prices will increase by 700 % for residential buyes from this august ."
12350,the average serbian nationalist requires 5 gallons of russian semen a day just to survive .
12351,"the president of serbia denounced the war , as serbia is turning itself to the eu , so some russian sympathizers in the population do not represent the whole . i wonder where you are from with such a biased comment ?"
12352,i have been to hungary the people are lovely their goverment ain't would probably not go now though because of orban .
12353,"hungary is a nice place to visit though , i've been there in 2017 and it was great , people were friendly and food was amazing . also it's really affordable ."
12354,i went to budapest in 2014 . was amazing
12355,"as a hungarian , i say hell it's about time . this government can have its fucking cake and eat it too . ( not that i'll enjoy an even further diminished quality of life but some consequences are more important than others )"
12356,how are they going to do that without someone vetoing it ?
12357," i , "
12358,"we don't want anything to do with them . sincerely , austria"
12359,certain sort of hungarians still haven't made peace with slovakia existing . certain itty-bitty-less-crazy sort would content themselves with the southern bits of it .
12360,"austria - hungary is / was not the union the people enjoyed . there are more than 18 different languages and communities lived in the ah union . imo , not a single person want to go for the "" glorious past "" . not to be mean but , they lost in both wws , so i dont know what people like orban say when they mean glorious ."
12361,"i just think putin wants to get back to a world view where super powers dictate the actions of countries in their "" influence sphere "". the soviet vs usa 1950s-60s mindset . in such a world view russia would again be relevant thanks to its nukes and they can start invading the rest of their neighbours . needless to say , nobody wants to play russia's game and if russia wants to negotiate , they should call the ukrainian president ."
12362,"so , he'd have to talk all nato . the only threat to russia is the fact that russia is losing it's power to affect neighbouring states . they tried talks , failed and waged a war as he had no other tools to use . it's a lost case , no matter how it finishes russians willl not be satisfied with the result ."
12363,"everyone in the war is exhausted so don't expect miracles . currently russia is slowly grinding away at the eastern front , and ukraine is slowly grinding away around kerson . lots of grinding ."
12364,for all intents and purposes 
12365,"> for all intensive purposes russia lost this war when they failed to take kyiv imagine losing thousands of your best troops in the first week , becausea country that was forged in fighting you eight years earlier decided not to lay down and die ."
12366,amen brother .
12367,"katalin novk , yes ."
12368,"yes , the most popular talking heads on fox news routinely cream themselves over orban . tucker carlson did an [ entire week ]( of his show from budapest where he interviewed and spoke glowingly of orban . moreover , orban has been invited to cpac , which is perhaps the most influential annual meeting of american conservatives , where he will [ deliver a speech ]( it's pretty much guaranteed that the next republican president will try to imitate orban's steps to weakening democracy and will be much more of a russia apologist ."
12369,cpac literally just held a meeting in hungary where orban gave a keynote address
12370,the republican party hosted a major conference in hungary and orban was a key note speaker .

12372,so they hate trump .... trump was as big of a putin arselicker as anyone . yeah . conservatives love orban .

12378,"> saddam hussein has weapons of mass destruction. - us intelligence you mean george bush , cheney , rumsfeld's distortion of the intel . the intel community told them there was no clear evidence , but the cheney warmongers ran with the ""[ curveball ]( narrative because they wanted the war ."
12379,us conservatives : us too !
12380,what are you blabbering about ? since when any baltic state vetoed any nato decision ?

12385,"pretty much thinks croatia is hungarian too : sad thing is , dispite all of this , right wing politicians ( a majority ) in croatia actually like him and aspire to him ."
12386,"what doesn't that jackass believe . if daddy putin somehow conquered ukraine , he'd make a deal to take half of my country , romania ."
12387,"yeah , this is definately about transcarpathia .. i thought this old teritorial claims thing was dead and burried .."
12388,that's even more absurd than putler's claim .
12389,"not parts . part . which is pretty much [ one town ]( of ~ 23k and its surrounding villages . edit : transcarpathia borders hungary , slovakia , poland and romania ( the longest border ). it's very diverse , to say the least . there used to be german communities there . as well as native rusyn ethnicities , roma etc . orban's claims are little more than "" revise trianon "" meme ."
12390,also romania . a whole chunk .
12391,"its true tho , there are big hungarian communities basicly in every country around hungary as leftover from old borders"
12392,china could say that about every country in the world
12393,"i say no skin because hungary is not the country at war nor at the risk of war . if russia wins , he's on the right side and putin gives him a bj for his troubles . if russia loses , he's still in the eu and nato , he can trade with all the countries around him and nothing is at risk . either way , hungary loses nothing out of this except the one-member veto rule in the eu that he's been a fan of abusing/threatening to abuse for a while now ."
12394,"> it's not just orban , chinese politicians made a similar comment the other day , calling for peace just as it is starting to become clear that russia's position in ukraine is unsustainable . china has truly fucked itself because it's a net importer of food , and their dalliance with russia , which is trying to use food as a weapon , is already backfiring spectacularly against china and the countries where it's trying to expand the bri in africa . the us and canada are much less vulnerable as we have the midwest and the prairies , but china does not . also , more manufacturing is coming back to canada , the us and mexico , the latter having excellent young demographics . it's fortress north america . on top of that , they've driven their economy into recession with zero covid and the russian market can't save them ."
12395,"and , not even all the western weapons they ask for either . the value of american overspending is showing here . i still think we should spend less , but damn ."
12396,"specifically for chinese uyghurs , whats stopping western countries from supplying them weapons is the chinese border . arming separatists inside of a sovereign nation would be an act of war . arming an invaded country against an aggressor nation is not ."

12400,"any invasion needs to be a blitzkrieg . that's the modern age . if you can't conquer a country by the first year , you cannot conquer it at all ."
12401,"it generally does , but i'll say it's far from a guarantee in ukraine . russia isn't fighting the same way america or the west might . they are actively and systematically committing genocide and trying to push out the local population by any means necessary . massacre of civilians in attacks , displacing ukrainians into deep russia , moving in russian sympathizers into the donbas , firing rockets indiscriminately at civilians or targeting non-combatant structures in areas they can't reach just to make like miserable for ukrainians in an attempt to make them flee , etcetc . i sure hope ukraine will hold out against russia , but i'll just say it will be a herculean task shouldered by the ukrainian people even if they get full support from the america , nato , and the industrialized democracies ."
12402,i am not sure if this still applies to modern wars where half of your countries infrastructure gets eradicated .
12403,"history has shown putin in his recent 2 wars that in an invasion of a country the attacker has a massive advantage because he just takes some territory and then nothing pushes him off of it because muh nukes or some other excuse . he chopped off pieces of 2 sovereign countries and then benefited from western europe doing jack shit to help the defenders retake the occupied territories . germany even went as far as to build nord stream 2 after the annexation of crimea and the occupation of donbass . he just miscalculated the response on this current one . i mean , the attacker benefits so much that the entire eastern nato flank is pushing for a doctrine change . my country didn't have tanks because we assumed we don't need tanks because tanks are an "" offensive weapon "". now we want tanks because we understand we need them to retake whatever we lose in the initial strike . another example : when the estonian prime minister said that there wouldn't be an estonia left to retake after 180 days of russian occupation , yeah it was a pr move , but it wasn't far from the truth . estonia is surrounded by sea on two sides and the only viable escape route for citizens - before sweden and finland joined nato - went through latvia , which would be attacked and genocided the same way . they just can't afford to lose anything ."

12407,"until there's a complete regime change , the current one is denounced , and it's leaders charged with crimes against humanity , they will never get along . it'd be like trying to have good relations with nazi germany , after they invaded poland and started the holocaust ."

12410,i would say the world - russia
12411,"if it ends the war and zelenskyy gets his territory back , i doubt he'd say no"
12412,"i think since the claim that led to the birth of moscow was signed in kyiv , ukraine actually did revoke the russian claim to moscow when the war started ."
12413,most all germans were deported from koenigsberg following the end of world war 2 . there was discussion of repatriation of the territory following the fall of the soviet union but people were nervous about the newly reunified germany so the germans withdrew all claims . they didn't want to also have several million russians become german citizens and perhaps with foresight as the protection of ethnic russians has been one of putin's casus belli in every military action .
12414,"> we can also go back a little in history and assert german claims on konigsberg . im sure putin would love that unfortunately , he might actually like that . the russians forcibly expelled the germans after wwii , which is why [ germany said they didn't want it back ]( if they took it back , i doubt the germans would want to forcibly relocate citizens because they're not fucking dicks these days . so if they took the territory , they'd be letting huge sums of former russian citizens become citizens of their country . that type of influx could influence politics , including their stances against russia ."
12415,if anything russia is ukraine territory . kyiv is older than moscow

12422,"i do not know eu law . in consensus processes you kick an asshole out of the group if they are being an asshole . the purpose of making everyone vote yes is that then they are committed . suppose you are voting on whether or not cookies will be available at saturday events . if everyone says they want cookies then it is far more likely that people will do some baking . they own the decision and follow through . any member can veto cookies or abstain . abstaining probably means your volunteer is not going to bake anything but does not mind cookies . a veto might be negotiable like "" my jimmy has peanut allergy "" so the group has to accommodate . if one person shows up to planning sessions and always vetoes everything because she wants to ruin saturday events you just kick her out . at least out of planning committee if not saturday events too . consensus voting also has a mental effect on those who have to vote . you have to comprehend what you are voting on . 80 + % of the time that i open my mouth in a steering committee meeting it is because the issue is still unclear to me . after discussion you actually are "" in favor "" as opposed to having "" not considered it ""."

12424,man i love hungary for its history and im sure there are a lot of decent people there but they need to get their shit together and kick this turd to the curb
12425,"same for croatia and parts of romania and so on . hungarians benefit from speaking a language almost no one understands or cares to learn . like if austrian media wrote that they should retake historic austrian lands , germans , swiss , northern italians and many german as second/third language in schools nations would realize hey , thats not cool ."
12426,"> i just think putin wants to get back to a world view where super powers dictate the actions of countries in their "" influence sphere "". the soviet vs usa 1950s-60s mindset . it's worse than that - putin doesn't want to return to this model , he believes it * never * stopped in the first place . that's why he sees eastern europe joining nato or ukraine trying to join the eu as american ploys to increase the us-centric sphere and not as sovereign nations deciding their own fates ."

12430,tbf thats true for a huge number of global economies 
12431,i bet theyve never pleasured a big economy before
12432,"they also told us that russia was actually going to invade , and everyone didn't believe them ."
12433,they said the taliban was going to win . their lack of confidence is part of the reason why the army fled .
12434,"fair , but erdogan's turkish goon squad would certainly try to block hungary's removal ( since they would be next on the list as far as being in bed with putin )."
12435,seriously the donbas is covered with trenches all the way to dnipro .
12436,"right wing politicians 101 : "" i make all the rules ""."

12440,"aye , and the sudetenland had germans in it . still wasn't great when the germans annexed it ."
12441,i can hear the habsburger knocking on the door asking for their land back .
12442,"> either way , hungary loses nothing out of this except hungarian agriculture is about to collapse . the only reason hungarian farmers could stay afloat against their bigger more efficient dutch , italian , spanish & french counterparts is the cap on energy prices . irrigation can cost potentially 20x than before . the average carrot producer is looking forward to paying 50000 next season just for irrigation , if the new policy & prices remain in effect . ( and of course everything else is more expensive as well , it will be absolutely crippling , even if they suck it up & spend that 50000 on solar panels ) also a large percentile of the households are forked real bad as well & that is already starting next month . the article says the changes only affect higher-usage households , but if you have 3 children & a freezer it will be a tall order to stay below the "" line "". a lot of modern housing is using electricity based heating , every single one of those families will have serious problems . to put it in simpler terms , if the war does not end promptly , with a swift return to the status quo , orban is done . it's hugely unfortunate that we've just had elections , but it's entirely possible that he will be forced to resign . we will have demonstrations of the order of magnitude that were unprecedented in the past 60 years . there are a lot of valid reasons to bash us hungarians for , but we sure know how to revolt . ( as history has proven )"
12443,china is going to have to go through lockdown after lockdown if they want to continue zero covid policy as it seems to be continually mutating .
12444,"we spend as much because we specifically had two potential threats to face and to stay ahead of : russia and china , and china would effectively be a two-front war . the arms race has always been a thing , it just got really spicy during the cold war . to the moon , as they say ."

12451,some good news on this emerged from a russian war hawk commander in the lysychansk area who said ukrainian partisan attacks and psycological activity are incredibly high .
12452,"even so , lets not forget just how quickly the us conquered afghanistan , and just how emphatically the us eventually lost that war . even if putin takes ukraine , he will face years if not decades of western supported insurgency ."
12453,"here is my massage from ukraine to america , eu , nato and all democracies of the world : we can win this war if we have enough heavy weapons . also if sanctions became stronger . because now what we are getting is barely enough to stabilize the frontline . but that should be done asap because we losing our best soldiers every day and our economy wasn't that good before the war , and now some lands became occupied , many people lose their homes and jobs and russians bombing our civilian infrastructure ."
12454,\> russia isn't fighting the same way america or the west might thankfully they cant afford to drop as many bombs as america or the west might . if russia did the 600 bombs and missiles against kyiv in the same way usa did the 600 bombs and missiles against baghdad it wouldnt be pretty .
12455,the soviets were responsible for a miilion or more deaths in afghanistan ( 1 in 15 of the population at the time ). they were fighting a much more total war than the us . still wasn't enough for victory .
12456,i think the pols dislike russia more .
12457,true . but that would have to include the crimea . ukrainian war aims are to regain all lost territory .
12458,"this war is a true war for independence . that is stripped from ukraine if other countries decide its future , no matter how beneficial the terms"

12462,"i know what vetoing is , im just asking how they actually expect to change that without hungary using their veto to prevent the change"
12463,"well now you're on the money ... turkey will try to block anything regarding all the europe's decisions , unless they directly benefit from it ... it's the old ottoman way of getting ahead"
12464,"as a romanian that doesnt really like romania ( dont we all ?), thank god for hungarians like you !!! much love , brother ! eta - what i mean is that some of us ( romanians ) are actually ignorant and downright rude to our minorities - which needs to stop already ! i appreciate immensely that there are people representing those minorities that live decent lives even in here . maybe there is hope for all of us to come together , after all !"
12465,"as a hungarian born and raised in hungary , i wish i was born and raised anywhere else ..."
12466,how is it being an ethnic hungarian in romania ? do you face any kind of racism or hardships ? do you speak romanian ? do you travel to places where only romanians live ( like bucharest ) and how is your communication with them ? just curious as a foreigner living in romania for 5 years .
12467,"same here . i don't follow politics but every time orbn is brought up , it's always something idiotic"
12468,"i've always seen hungary ( government ), as so corrupt and underproductive . a fairly large nation with such a rich history which has just been devastated in the past by the ussr and cannot climb out of that corrupt hole ."
12469,"yeah , i mean , sure one can say that the hungarian communities living there make the place "" hungarian "", but that's not what o1g means when he says it . not a single thing he ever says is bona fide , it's purposely a cynical , divisive , or straight up a blatant lie . he really meant that it "" belongs to hungary "" like some medieval peasants to their king ."
12470,"they have no choice unless they do an about face , admit that they need mrna vaccines , and make a purchase order accordingly . that of course would involve a massive loss of face for daddy xi , whose propaganda machine spent the past year telling his people that mrna vaccines are unsafe ."

12472,> ukrainian partisan attacks and psycological activity are incredibly high . that's what happens when you fuck with any of the locals who are high on national pride and intent to maintain their sovereignty .
12473,"he can't take us . at least without mobilization of the entire russian population . ukraine is very big country . it's might looks small compared to russia or us , but we are biggest country in the europe , if we count in internationally recognized borders from 1991 ."
12474,"well , the germans didn't stick around to occupy the country for the next 45 years , and did atleast acknowledge the bad shit they did . russia has just about acknowledged katyn and seems to even be trying to roll back on that ."
12475,agreed . also it's just crimea . saying the crimea or the ukraine makes it sound like a region rather than it's own distinct entity . moreso a problem for ukraine but still
12476,i just giggled imagining the serbs swallowing 5 gallons of cement/mortar from russia just to survive . 
12477,"i try not to generalize but let's just say , orbn's supporters aren't from the capital mostly . quite common to find open racism , xenophobia , homphopbia and antisemitism on the countryside . sadly even in budapest we have problem with that just waaay less and way more hidden ."
12478,"oh got it , thanks"
12479,the new discussion is whether or not to overrule hungary's veto . you need unanimous consent to do that . brexit happened . i did not follow the technical details . presumably any eu country can also exit . they could negotiate a new european union the neu and adopt all the same rules as old eu but without hungary . then everyone can decide for themselves if they want to be in both neu and eu or just exit eu and be in neu . it is not a thing to do lightly or quickly . orban knows he can mess around a lot without creating a consensus that hungary has to go . there is some theoretical limit where one state is just too much hassle .
12480,"hey thanks ! thankfully i haven't really encountered any nationality-based rudeness since childhood . and yeah , romania has its own problems , but damn if everytime i hear about the shitshow our neighbors have to endure i don't feel grateful we're not that bad ."
12481,"man thats rough does orban actually have majority support , or is it illiberal some minority rule bs ? if he actually has majority support , wtf happened to you guys ? how did hungarians collectively lose their minds ? anyhow , as an american living in a shitty jesus freak part of my country , youve got all my love . stay safe , strong , and sane ."
12482,"i only really encountered nationality-based hate when i was a younger kid , and some jokes in high school from my romanian classmates , but nothing actively harmful . i grew up speaking both hungarian and romanian , so that's never been an issue for me . i have been to bucharest and other more romanian-heavy places but i mostly keep to transylvania , where i grew up . can't say people have noticed i am hungarian when speaking with them in romanian , though . maybe they did and they just didn't care ."
12483,i holidayed in poland a few years ago and the poles and east germans got on well due to the shared trauma of the soviet bloc years .
12484,"crimea is a region , though . a region of ukraine . i can understand ukraine/the ukraine ( although it could be a language problem , since for example in italy we use the in front of any country name : lucraina , litalia , la francia )."
12485,"ah , the erdogan way ... how do you feel about the eu pressure being put on hungary lately ?"
12486,"well they buy votes and drive people to vote for their party , but even without that they'd get the majority votes for sure , he had supermajority for 12 years now , people just simply don't care enough to even vote for anyone else , also orbn's party owns pretty much every media outlet in the country , so they can lie about anything anytime , and have tv stations literally feed propaganda all day long . for weeks before election this years , if you ever turned to any of the state tv channels , it was just constant "" fidesz ( orbn's party ) good , opposition bad "", so bad they literally played orbn's speeches for hours and hours without end , and the opposition politicians only got 5 minutes to speak . that's not a joke , in 4 years , the entire opposition only got 5 minutes on national tv , and that was at a very early hour , when noone even watched it , and it never got replayed . for people like me , and well most of the younger generation , who don't just watch tv , but actually read news online and socialize with outside world we didn't even know they are this strong , we kinda lived in our bubbles because we mostly interracted with eachother , and honestly even fidesz was scared this year a little bit , but wast majority of the country , and the people who vote live in smaller vilages and are pretty much brainwashed , as much as i hate this word , to only vote for orbn . so much as at voting booths you could hear people being so stupid just going to others asking which one is orbn , which one is the correct answer ... there was no voting fraud , there was no cheating , other than paying people and driving them there , but as i said , i'm 100 % sure orbn would've won just about as much without that . orbn got 2,823,419 votes , while opposition got 1,983,708 . so by numbers , it isn't really that big difference . but as you know , gerrymandering and these tricks just help them ."
12487,"my ex wife and her whole extended slovak-hungarian family all support orban . my whole family that are slovak also support orban . slovaks aren't supposed to support hungarians . right ?? we're supposed to be pretty and shit .. how is this guy so popular ? i'm divorced and unhappy with this situation . fuck putin , and orban can go suck a dick . what the fuck is wrong with people .. i just don't get it .. i don't want my son to die in a war , fuck .. they say there isn't going to be a war . and it's the same people that said putin wouldn't invade . well he did . he's a fucking lunatic .. alright i'm drunk , going to sign off . so much for eastern european stereotypes .. sorry for the rant . also , sending love to hungary ."
12488,"it is language problem , but as long as people don't make some exception just for ukraine which makes it sound lesser , we're okay with that . "" the "" part in english just directly mirrors the way russians ( who do not have articles in language ) say on ukraine instead of in ukraine , which implies it is just a space , not a country or even a region ."
12489,"that's a big chunk of population to reasonably doubt he would've won in fair elections . does anyone protest ? overall , minus "" no voting fraud "", that's what russian elections look like ."
12490,"they are using the same playbook here in your southern neighbor serbia . we're doomed . and demography is on their side , average aga in serbia is 41.6 years , hungary 43.3 years . brainwash older folks trough tv and newspaper and you can rule forever ."
12491,"fuuuuuuck dude . im sorry to hear that . reminds me of my old state of tennessee before i moved north to a slightly better state . for what its worth , just remember that orban is old and the generation that put him in power is slowly dying . it will take awhile , but the future belongs to you , and nothing can change that . edit : ignore my other comment . that was intended for someone else . my bad "
12492,"thank you for explaining . i , too , live in the gerrymandered us south , in a city where my local council is more to the left , and out of 7 members only 2 members are right wing . its been that way for years . however , my state congressional district is red , as is my us representative district - both were extremely gerrymandered but in our last state election the maps were redrawn by the state supreme court who appointed a special master . so the districts are a little better but because rural virginia is generally red and stupid , we are still a blue island in a sea of red . if it weren't for the cities and some unique counties that are very environmentally and socially conscious , it would be a very different picture . also , our two state senators are moderate dems , which is fortunate . we'd like them more left leaning but if they were they probably wouldn't be re-elected . anyway , all this is to say , solidarity from virginia . we appreciate your perspective and experience and send love , strength , and all good things ."
12493,so i should start saying the russia . got it
12494,"when i was young , people used the say "" the argentine "" instead of argentina . and they still say "" the us ."" i think it may just be an archaic manner of speaking ."
12495,"it's not just ukraine though , e.g . the netherlands and the philippines are usually also referred to with a "" the "" prefix . even for * the * usa it's used quite often ."
12496,"honestly this feels shit to say , but i'm kinda happy we have serbia having the same problem . i mean it is very shit , but there is some comfort knowing we are not alone . you know , kinda the same thing when you failed a test in school but when you realize your best friend also failed you're like kinda feeling better . altho i'm hoping we both can get a truly democratic country , it's so shit , but every year it gets worse and worse , and now with orbn straight up gloryfying race theory and them realizing they have more power than they even realized , it's very very scary ."
12497,"ah , but if people who vote for them die out , they will turn to regular voting fraud . nothing will change if discontent people simply wait ."
12498,"you do understand that there are different contexts to stuff , right ? netherlands and philippines have plurality in their names and ** even ** usa is a classifier name . ukraine only has the article because of historical tendencies to refer to our lands as exactly that , lands that were to be claimed and not a sovereign nation . as we are currently paying tribute in blood to prove our sovereignty , this is the worst time of all to try and demean us in such a way . we also probably would mind it much less , if that talking point was not brought up in russia all the time ."
12499,"> the post article , which was published tuesday , did not specify when and where stoltenberg made these comments , and newsweek was not immediately able to confirm those details . nato was contacted to verify the date and context of the secretary general's remarks . what kind of journalists are working there ? i was able to [ find it ]( in a few minutes and i'm usually terrible at stuff like this ."
12500,"now with the gas being cut , europe should go all in on ukraine support . that was pretty much the biggest thing that putin had over europe ."
12501,""" pay for the support , pay for the humanitarian aid , pay the consequences of the economic sanctions , because the alternative is to pay a much higher price later on ,"" . there you go , this should have been clear for everyone from the begining . if russia gets what they want this will repeat itself , not now , not in a couple of years , but eventually and it will be worse then with a strenghtened russian federation ."

( i'm a bot ) ***** > nato secretary general jens stoltenberg reportedly urged a legislative body of the european union to "" stop complaining "" and take action to support ukraine during the ongoing war with russia . > stoltenberg , who has been nato's secretary general since 2014 , added : "" we should stop complaining and step up and provide support , full stop ."" > while urging the european parliament to "" stop complaining "" and provide the financial aid to ukraine , stoltenberg stressed that not helping ukraine could put europe in peril down the road . "" it is in our interest to help ukraine because you have to understand that if ukraine loses this , that's a danger for us ,"" the post quoted him as saying . ***** [** extended summary **]( | [ faq ]( "" version 2.02 , ~ 660332 tl;drs so far ."") | [ feedback ]( "" pm's and comments are monitored , constructive feedback is welcome ."") | * top * * keywords *: ** ukraine**^1 ** european**^2 ** stoltenberg**^3 ** pay**^4 ** nato**^5"
12503,he is spot on . ukraine is in eu backyard . they should stop complaining and help ukraine to win the war .
12504,"the price we pay as the european union , as nato , is the price we can measure in currency , in money ,"" he said . "" the price [ ukrainians ] pay is measured in lives lost every day. hes totally right"
12505,"just speaking from the us , biden stepped up to the plate very early in the days/weeks preceding the invasion and directly told the american people that this support was not going to be easy in any sort of way . there is definitely a need to be angry , but directing that anger at world leaders who * arent * putin just baffles me . direct that anger at the fucking aggressor ."
12506,"also , he mentioned that ukraine is fighting this with their lives , while we are asked to fight this with money and resource . not only that . most military equipment get obsolete eventually . essentially , weapons we sent are money we spent already , mostly . they will be replaced with even better stuff in the future which can only make us safer . what better use of old equipment than for them to beat up even older equipment ?"
12507,i watched the actual speech . he's right - the price of not helping ukraine is higher than helping it .
12508,"still surprised to see so many tabloids on worldnews . get some standards , people ."
12509,thank the gods no one in reddit has any power over anything in the world .
12510,"if costs for humanitarian aid , weapons and other forms of support is an issue , europe and us still have the option to seize more than $ 300 + billions in frozen russian central bank assets . that will significantly help offset costs while minimizing inflation ."
12511,europe will be doing more than complaining once winter comes
12512,not that europe is complaining but currently europe is pretty much roasting and burning as of right now
12513,"anyone have a better comprehensive list than this ? this cannot be right , can it ?"
12514,"the comments here are utterly amazing . they all ignore the actual reality which is that with the past few years so many people are barely keeping their heads above water and our governments are buying more weapons to send to ukraine then they are food for their own people . this idea that "" hey if russia wins life might be tougher "" is dumb because life for so many in europe is already near impossible . its absurd to ask those barely surviving to just let themselves drown because , well , in a decade you might perhaps have a chance of drowning again . we don't have the money , the rich do , so go and get it from them instead of continuing to gut our welfare and social services . to the americans bitching about the nations in europe and their nato contributions , please go away . you do not understand europe and your warmongering is your own business . i understand that you don't get things like good welfare , free healthcare etc but they are actually great things that we need more investment in . if you want more drones for ukraine you magic up the money , don't steal it from the poor that need that welfare as we see record inflation . also , this idea that america is only in nato out of the kindness of its heart is insane , the us is part of it in order to exert the global influence it needs to survive . you aren't actually going to leave , and , even if you did , russia still wouldn't be a major threat . the us needs nato , no matter how much it bitches about 2 % every so often . europe doesn't get "" a free ride "" because if it did america would never agree to it . the us acts as the worlds police and consistently conduct illegal wars which trade lives for more funds for arms manufacturers , do you really think they give a shit about europe outside of its support for their position on the world stage ? of course they don't . edit : its funny how people live to bitch about russian bots but it always seems like anyone critical of the us or anything other than unrestrained military spending gets downvoted to hell . russia is a shit semi-fascist oligarchy but i refuse to accept that they best way to combat them is too dismantle our entire welfare systems and spend it all on us weapons ."
12515,this clip of one of his speeches the other day hit it on the head so damn well 
12516,people are going to freeze to death this winter because of the price increases . will nato help them ?
12517,wont be his kids going to war
12518,"some people are very shortsighted . they complain about gas prices today , but don't think what can happen otherwise to their children in a few decades ."
12519,"the current russian administration & economy need to be eradicated . yes , that's very extreme rhetoric , and i'm aware of it . but this planet , with all the crises going on right now , can't afford some fascist dictator on a power trip , dragging the rest of the world to hell with him ."
12520,"although hes right why is the leader of a defence pact telling members to aid a non member ? this doesnt help the narrative that nato is provoking/attacking russia . putin literally uses this argument to justify these invasions to his people , this only bolsters his support from the public ."
12521,send more money for dem programs
12522,""" don't complain and suffer for us interests , thanks """
12523,"the eu , nato and the democracies are in a very delicate situation . as how long before suddenly the resolve break and members of the eu want to have another munich conference and peace in our time and putin and his allies feel emboldened and empowered . it would certainly led to belarus joining russia again , and putin then turning his sites towards moldova , estonia , latvia , lithuania . and he could very well test the resolve of our alliances . and push is to a breaking point that eventually a global conflict ensues . whats more important ? cheap gasoline or democracy and freedom ? sometimes politicians need to swallow a bitter pill of doing whats right and not necessarily whats popular electorally or what helps their donors ."
12524,"nato leader tells europe to "" stop complaining "" and ~~ help ukraine ~~ pay corrected for you ."
12525,fucking preach .
12526,"let me guess , with more weapons and no way to track them ?"
12527,without ukraine where will everyone launder money ???? help them !
12528,nato is not allied with ukraine and under no obligation to help them
12529,someone let him know that he should arm the nukes if he wants to go that direction
12530,"yeah , we're so close to winning . we just need a little more of your tax dollars !"
12531,tell that to germany
12532,he's being too nice but i appreciate someone who isn't too much of a coward to say it .
12533,"any strategic decision of such magnitude must go through national parliaments and the eu parliament . that's the foundation of a democracy . yes , it's inconvenient , democracy is slow but works . if the nato general secretary doesn't understand that , he should look for another job / be relieved of his position . i am by no means implying that ukraine doesn't need further assistance , but it has to be properly implemented ."
12534,stop the war and start negotiating insted . nato and the west is prepared to fight to the last ukrainian just to weaken russia .
12535,well somebody had to say it
12536,i know right ? well said - if europe doesn't help ukraine then it will be someone else in russia's sight !
12537,"european here . i agree . we need to help ukraine . russia has shown that it is on a trajectory of conquest - georgia , crimea , now whole of ukraine . also , the sooner ukraine can kick out russian army out of its borders the sooner the economic problems stop . finally if we don't help ukraine taiwan is next , and with tsmc gone our industries are gone too . so in the end , we cannot afford to not help ukraine ."
12538,these idiot trumptards in uk are too stupid to understand that ukraine is settled science . guess they want to be on the wrong side of history 
12539,its ironic that europe is essentially subsidizing russias war on ukraine though oil and gas purchases .
12540,good to see someone with a set of balls
12541,stop taxing the americans
12542,"se got money to launder , so send it over to ukraine so they can wash it for us"
12543,it is better to pay for inflation than watch how missiles are landing in your city .
12544,"it's like asking america to give up burgers , good luck !"
12545,france hes talking to you !
12546,tone deaf . it's unbelievable
12547,good luck with no gas for the next 5 years .
12548,"yes , 100 % agree we pay in money , ukrainians pay in lives . there ist nothing to complain about"
12549,"yeah , and i wonder how the cost of living is affecting his family . and why support ukraine ? they will not join the eu or nato even if they won the war"
12550,"no one in the eu is going to send in troops . ukraine is fucked . i love how reddit talks shit about the usa but oddly enough , the usa is probably the only military that can actually stop russia and push them back to moscow . eu isnt going to do it . uk isnt going to do it . eu is just a bunch of little bitch countries who are too scared to fight in a war when its right on their doorstep ."
12551,100 % slava ukraine 
12552,"you can complain and help at the same time , since germany did this big brain move and shut down all of their power production being it nuclear or coal . norway has ended up as the aa battery of germany and europe , norway that produced around 150 % of its own consumption of power is now facing rationing electricity during the upcoming winter because of some stupid agreement that "" electricity and power would flow both ways "" when it was always one sided to begin with ."
12553,europe should tell ukraine to stop begging .
12554,yeah stop funneling all of americas money for this shit . wtf
12555,how tf is germany always involved something that bites them in the ass when made public
12556,"hear , hear !"
12557,it's been hilarious watching the us direct the eu to cannibalize themselves in support of their failed attempt at regime change in russia ! they out here acting like nato hasn't been dumping billions of dollars in weapons into the kiev regime for years ! stop complaining he yells ! lmfao !
12558,can usa ship enough oil to sustain europe instead of using any of russias oil ? we have plenty of oil to go around . we just need democrats to cooperate with permits and drilling . i understand democrats goal to reduce climate change but we need to stop dependence on russian oil first . start building nuclear power plants everywhere asap .
12559,nato leader can suck it .
12560,"you can't play appeasement games with full on insane dictators . europe should send everything that is not needed to defend their own borders against russia , including instructors . smash the russians and push them out of ukraine . then putin might have to leave office , and russia might be allowed to sell discounted gas/oil to europe again while europe looks for alternative energy sources . a dictator like putin only respects strength , nothing else"
12561,"hahaha , so funny , like anyone could stop europeans from complaining ."
12562,> both countries would 100 % engage in a first-use strike if they deemed it the strategically preferred outcome . on what are you basing your statement that the us would ever engage in a first-use strike if they deemed it the strategically preferred outcome .????
12563,"i would add to the chief of nato that they should intervene , war would end in three weeks tops and no it would not start a nuclear war because you would be fucking russians in ukraine . its between them and the psychologists of the feel shamed"
12564,eu shld give more military aid in terms of equipment and weapons as well as humanitarian aid . ukraine could so easily put them to good use
12565,"its like the humans , the dwarfs , the elves and the ents must stand up together against sauron and mordor with its ork army otherwise each of them will fall alone one after the other"
12566,europe get your shit together and start building up your military again .
12567,i am a fan of jens stoltenberg...he's straight to the point .
12568,"if that is not a red flag for europe back down from nato , then just give its keys to usa and forfeit country sovereignty ."
12569,europe needs to learn to stop begging america for help and build up its own militaries like in the 80s
12570,"honestly ... europe sucks . the politicians are pure garbage . not all of them , but a few nations that i wont name , are the most selfish , hypocritical dbags on earth . rot in a hole with putin when this is done . stop making the us save your arses every time , bc one day you may be on your own ."
12571,"bit of a course paraphrase there . more like he said that our hardships are nothing compared to ukraine's , and that we need to refocus on helping them . likely in response to faltering support as people got "" bored "" with the conflict as it wore on ."
12572,and so they should
12573,it was it good speech
12574,"only germany , france and hungary are complaining ."
12575,jens stoltenberg is an amazing man
12576,"give them fuckers hell , time for change to happen , no more of this regressive bs and help our fellow countries . divided we fall , united we rise ."
12577,"newsweek was gutted a few years ago . surprised they even covered this news , theyve mostly resorted to reposting clickbait from around the internet ."
12578,bruh its newsweek
12579,"tbf , there are a not insignificant number of people willing to exchange democracy for air conditioning and a good wifi signal ."
12580,""" not immediately able "" those some prime weasel words ."
12581,"with the gas gone , russia has no more leverage over germany ."
12582,"it's also such an efficient way to spend a defense budget ! normally , if the uk buys an nlaw rocket launcher , there's a decent chance that tube spends its entire lifespan sitting on a shelf in some warehouse just in case it * might * be needed , until it's thrown out or sold at a massive loss because it's obsolete . that's a normal and known part of defense spending . you can't magically summon complex equipment when you need it , so you buy a lot just in case . but if the uk buys an nlaw and sends it to ukraine , it * will * be used to blow up a russian tank , probably within a matter of weeks ! it's the most effective possible use of defense money . aid for ukraine isn't just a moral imperative . it's a chance for nato to take one of our biggest threats off the board without spending a drop of our own blood . do it . we won't get the chance again ."
12583,ukraine has more gas supplies in the east and is a shorter run to the western countries . tapping in to that will weaken russia ... russia wants these supplies .
12584,its the withdrawal symptoms that europes politicians are worried about
12585,"western europe is going to be in for a very tough winter . my concern is that this creates political instability , which could get some far-right russian sympathizers elected ."
12586,the west has the chance to weaken a strategic adversary with little harm to itself and at a discount . its basically an opportunity on a golden platter - geopolitically speaking .
12587,uh maybe the extortionate spending during record inflation is also a problem
12588,"apart from nuclear weapons , you mean ?"
12589,a problem getting worse the longer we ignore it ? sounds familiar .
12590,"this is the repeat . russia got what they wanted in 2014 and the world at large made noises that ultimately resulted in shit , and lo and behold , eight years later they're at it again and everyone's "" omg ! how could this happen ?""."
12591,"thats exactly right . also , i feel like china is watching this conflict play out and gauging whether or not they could stage an attack on taiwan . if we show china that we can alienate them , ruin their economy , and stifle their military ; then theyre much less likely to attack ."
12592,""" in the backyard ""? it's the front door ."
12593,"yes , because unfortunately saying that ukrainians are fighting for our freedom is not a hyperbole at all ."
12594,"ne , hes not "" spot on "", because no one is complaining and europe is helping ukraine to win the war ."
12595,this is one thing america is doing right . we have given them over 25 billion in aid and last i checked the uk has only given them 1b .
12596,"europe should be concerned with russia invading more of europe after ukraine . but maybe we should speak to their wallets , because a russian victory wont be good for the economy , ukrainian victory would be very good for the economy ."
12597,"im sure there are russian trolls specifically trying to cause rifts between everyone . lets be real , disinfo is really the only thing they are good at ."
12598,"i am not really a big fan of biden as a president , but , of the many ways that he is an improvement over trump , one of my favorites is that i dont have to watch trump help russia take over europe ."
12599,"a bit unrelated , but makes me think : there is this odd flaw in the system where if you make correct but unpopular decisions , you eventually will be replaced . most likely by someone with big , empty promises . so by doing the right thing now , you reduce your ability to do the right thing in the future . politics are weird ."
12600,"the strange thing is i wonder wtf is up with european leaders or europeans feeling this isn't supposed to impact them when it's right in their backyard . russia is literally at their door and they are the ones who's next on the menu if russia gobbles up ukraine . the us and americans seem more resolved to help ukraine so long as the zelenskyy and ukrainian people are willing to fight . americans are pissed about inflation , tanking asset prices , and higher energy costs , but most also realize that the pain is here and will likely continue . while the right likes to blame biden , i think the average american also feels that america needs to do what it takes to contain russia even if it means economic pain because if we don't it's going to worse in the future when we pay both the economic price and blood price for containing russia/china . i'm not surprised usa/americans are more willing to pay the financial price ( as opposed to the blood price paid in afghanistan ) to preserve us lead world order . and ofc these statements don't apply to all europeans , poland and many of the ex-ussr countries were the first to respond with weapons , tanks , supplies , and refugee support before the us could even get over there . but other parts of europe ? i'm just surprised how they can act like this isn't happening right outside their doorstep . as if usa and nato will guarantee russia doesn't attack them . putin has proven he doesn't give a shit . usa likely won't use nukes even if russia invades a nato member . if china and russia moved in unison ? usa might not be there to bail europeans out immediately since it will be splitting forces to protect multiple fronts . and even with us troops/supplies doesn't mean russia can't wage devastation on them . but they act like they are isolated from those risks as if they are living over here in the new world ."
12601,its reddit its not logical
12602,"even more importantly , most of these weapons were originally built to defend against russian / soviet aggression . getting them to the people who use them to blow up invading russian vehicles , guns , and aircraft lets them serve their true purpose ."
12603,you don't minimize inflation by introducing more money into the economy
12604,"russia , you pay for this mess you made , one way or another ! yes , the rest of the world will have to as well , but thats the price of democracy ."
12605,"and as soon as winter comes , most of europe will be fu ***** if russia decides to turn off the gas supply . at this point , ordinary people won't give a sh ** about what is happening in ukraine . they will become selfish as soon as they loose their jobs , won't be able to pay their rent , ect . the last thing they will think about is the suffering of ukranian people , with all due respect ."
12606,"well if 34c is roasting to you then damn i guess i am roasted . every morning here is sub 19c , on country side goes down to 15c . don't eat up everything you see on tv or radio ."
12607,"seems about right . more aid than this has been delivered , is in the process of delivery or will be delivered in the coming weeks , months , etc ..."
12608,"> to the americans bitching about the nations in europe and their nato contributions , please go away . american's eagerness to help is commendable but it really shows that they can literally bomb/attack/sanction anyone they want without worrying about having their home soil bombed or attacked and suffering sanctions ."
12609,great comment . if this goes on people in europe will be fu **** when winter comes . i already see some scenarios in the news in the country i live in where they try to prepare for the worst case scenario ( electricity outages f.e .) due to potential missing gas supply . it's going to be an interesting lead up to winter to say the least ...
12610,at last a comment with some sense !
12611,"the top dogs here in the us would never turn down the purchase of millions of dollars of military equipment , so they're pushing hard for that . to me it seems like despite all of the allied posturing everyone is really our for themselves as it's always been ."
12612,"> this idea that "" hey if russia wins life might be tougher "" is dumb because life for so many in europe is already near impossible . you're being very naive if you don't think it can get a whole lot worse by letting russia do whatever it wants . yeah , life is tough right now . it can get a whole lot tougher . > its absurd to ask those barely surviving to just let themselves drown because , well , in a decade you might perhaps have a chance of drowning again . that's not absurd at all . sooner or later russia needs to be confronted . you seem to be advocating later is better , and if that's your stance , you need to explain why that's better . or do you think the world should stand by as russia genocides its neighbours one by one ? > we don't have the money , the rich do , so go and get it from them instead of continuing to gut our welfare and social services . you're generally right about that . it's important that people in power are not given the excuse to use this situation to unreasonably increase wealth disparity ."
12613,> because ~~ of the price increases .~~ decades of complete and total political mismanagement and corruption .
12614,"neither will yours . or ours . hes asking europe to stop whinging about giving financial support to ukraine , precisely because it prevents other european nations from going to war ."
12615,that's exactly his point . ukrainian kids die every day while europe quibbles about money .
12616,*** most people *** are very shortsighted .
12617,"people do not seem to complain about gas prices yet , they complain about teh real fear of no gas at all . which basically would destroy many european economies . take the german glass companies . without gas , their is no glas . without glas , no vaccine viles etc . so i can see why people are afraid and try to figure out what to do . as a german , the biggest issue is that merkel fucked us hard for 16 years . noone wanted to hear that during her reign but she has done more to make us subserviant to russia than any other chancelor in the existence of germany . yet she was celebrated abroad like crazy ."
12618,"so lets say europe doesn't help ukraine . how would that help gas prices ? the faster the war is over , the quicker gas prices will normalize . at this point that means you either want russia to win or ukraine to win . to me , it's the same thing . you either help ukraine win faster , and gas prices normalize , or you help russia win and gas prices normalize . gas and food prices can't stabilize while the war continues ."
12619,"> happen otherwise to their children in a few decades . like i can afford children . i was like 3 times 18\~ away to pay to work ( travel costs , costs of living and more ) aka earning less than it costs"
12620,"are you talking about gasoline ? or natural gas . gasoline was already sky rocketing long before the war started . * anyone * claiming gasoline prices are high due to ukraine is an idiot , including presidents . now natural gas for europe ? a much larger and complex issue ."
12621,"you've on point . this is the biggest failure of our education system . teaching people to think long-term is relatively easy , even if it's in a fairly abstract sense . yet people are pushed out of our educational system barely thinking beyond their next weekend ."
12622,agreed . its one crisis piled on top of another and russia is contributing to a good part of it .
12623,"would be great if russian economy could be left intact while removing the administration , but that's more or less impossible ."
12624,"> putin literally uses this argument he's also used the argument that he was attacking nazis when he bombed a holocaust memorial . we shouldn't give a damn about what argument putin might make , since he's just making up whatever shit he wants anyhow ."
12625,"well , it doesn't really go against nato's point either . russia is actively fighting a friendly , but not legally allied nation , that borders multiple nato nations . russia is also on the ( long ) path to losing the war they themselves started . nato was formed specifically to deal with the soviet union/russia . they have the potential to completely destroy russia's ability to be a threat to nato for decades by almost literally tossing money at the problem and nothing else . he's not "" ordering "" the nations to do it , he's just pointing out that very obviously , either you pay money now or you pay in lives , infrastructure , and territory later . for those who don't care about nuance , sure , this seems exactly like what putin is claiming that this whole thing was nato's fault somehow . for anyone with more than 6 braincells and can understand the word nuance , there's a vast and obvious difference between nato deliberately telling ukraine to confront russia to arrange this situation , and russia starting the fight when ukraine gets friendly with nato over the simple fact of "" russia threatens to kill us if we don't obey , nato nations mostly negotiate mutually beneficial trade deals that could help us .""."
12626,the general secretary is more like the chief diplomat than the leader . he's pointing out that the collective security of nato members is on the line if we don't step up now .
12627,"this is russia invading europe . you literally can't get closer to european interests if you tried i have to assume this is a bot comment because it's so out of touch with reality , desperate to paint the us as the bad guy when putin started this war "
12628,"ah yes , jens stoltenberg , notable american . dumbass edit - i thought a dumbass would make a / s redundant "
12629,"germany , france or italy arent invading ukraine . everyone here knows that there needs to be something done to stop russia and that certain sacrifices have to be made . and very obviously the overwhelming reliance on russia energy was a bad decision but its not like economic cooperation with autocratic states is somehow below the us . i wonder if people are gonna be so willing for sacrifice when china marches on taiwan . europe is helping ukraine . and everyone here knows that russia cant just be let off . but torpedoing europes economy for most likely no effect is simply not on the table ."
12630,the uk's got that covered don't you worry .
12631,"in the uk , just like before the the war ."
12632,the us promised ukraine protection in return for them giving up their nukes .
12633,if you are just talking about money they are far ahead of every other european country
12634,"you cant tell em shit . they are always and forever right and on spot . no remorse , no accepting mistake / wrong policy , nothing . oh , and some of them already claim that germany helps more than others ."
12635,nato never cared about democracy . it's just another tool to further american imperialism and dominance .
12636,"fight to the last ukrainian is a pro-moscow narrative that for some reason supposed to blame us and nato for the war . but in reality fight for the last ukrainian is just showing real intentions of russians in this war - to kill all ukrainians , technically genocide . and reported , btw ."
12637,"thing is putins russia has no negotiating on the table . last time they negotiated was at chechen war . only to strike again two years later . and they evolved that to new heights as it is seen with donbass where they say it there is no more fighting on their side but so called separatists continue war using their supplies . technically seize fire is done but reality is far from it . now it came to a full on invasion of a country that is technically in europe . a sovereign country that had surrendered nuclear arsenal to have that sovereignty upheld by multiple countries , russia in that list as well . so yeah nice try but no"
12638,"russian soldiers will never march on berlin and paris because \ 1 they are not strong enough to push militarily through multiple countries and against a dozens-member military alliance \ 2 any outsider support would be very limited as there would definitely be distaste in joining such a war , except for maybe belarus and russia's puppet allies \ 3 nukes would hit the ground before they would be able to make it"
12639,"i mean...as long as nato exists that will never happen , but i get what i saying and i agree + ask all governments to deliver what ukraine is asking for"
12640,"it's the baltic states next , then poland . putin is never going to stop , until someone stops him ."
12641,even trump during his time in office was already warning them to wean off russian gas and shore up their nato commitments . the us and uk had to do the heavy lifting during the initial invasion while europe was just pointing fingers at each others
12642,"i can give up burgers , but not beer"
12643,has anyone ever told you that youre the funniest person in the world ?
12644,"singling out france ( and germany ) is getting old . frances stance has been not to disclose what its convoys to ukraine were transporting . but ** this war isnt a dick measuring contest ** between countries to see whos sending more weapons anyway . its not because you dont see articles on reddit about what x country does that nothing is happening . not disclosing everything doesnt sound like a bad thing to me . we dont need to know everything . a recent documentary shows how macron has handled the invasion since the beginning from the inside . we hear one of the phone calls with putin , which sounded like everything but a friendly phone call of courtesy , we can also hear phone calls with other world leaders , including zelensky , who has expressed how much of an ally france has been . i choose to believe him rather than what reddit portrays , but to each their own ."
12645,"eh , we should find alternatives anyways , so maybe it's a good thing in the long run ."
12646,"fyi , the dude isn't even american . you probably should stay away from voting . do the world a favour ."
12647,then pay for your own defense and it wont be american dominated
12648,"if you ran ukraine , what would you do ?"
12649,"money well spent imho , but it would be nice if every country did their fair share . a lot of countries have though ."
12650,"> we just need democrats to cooperate with permits oh fuck off . there are hundreds ( if not thousands ) of granted permits and leases not being used . they collect them like trading cards . any fields that are started today will take 20 years to achieve full production , by which time we hopefully won't need the extra ."
12651,like no one can stop americans complaining about europeans

12653,i do not really support bringing more weapons out there . humanitarian aid is no problem .

12659,"thirty years ago , that meant something ."
12660,their journalism quality is pretty subpar . the other day they reported on a russian su-34 plane getting shot down . the picture they posted was an su-57 which is noticeably different from an su-34 and the caption called it an su-34 . this is a 5 second google search that should have been done but they couldn't be arsed to do it .
12661,"and despite that sentiment it is still constantly linked in political subs , the big news subs , / r/technology , etc . subs need to start banning the site , it is a clickbait pos ."
12662,huh ? it's a video of the person in question saying the words that he is quoted as saying .
12663,"and since when is a video of the person saying something not considered a source ? that's about as good of a source as you can get , straight from the man himself !"
12664,since when video is not a source of information ???
12665,wait when did russia cut off the gas ?
12666,they didnt cut all gas
12667,uhhh when they start begging for it ?
12668,plus we get to field test our stuff against a peer adversary .. for ' free ' again not a lot of real world info on javelin or nlaw performance against modern russian armor in a battlefield before 2022 . and using javelins on toyota hi luxes in afghanistan doesnt count
12669,"gas fields just off shore of crimea , massive farm land in the "" independant "" regions , high quality ore for metal work in the mountains , and mariepol being the city that would be the main connecting point to those downline for all these industries . it's all about economic power , always has been . putin cares as mucg for ukrainian russians as he does for his own citizens ."
12670,"> western europe is going to be in for a very tough winter . i don't see why . only germany was mostly reliant on russian gas for their industries , all other countries in western europe only used a tiny fraction which they have now compensated for ."
12671,why didn't they address this a few years ago .
12672,"considering how hot it is at the moment , can it really get that cold later ?"
12673,"it's also an excellent opportunity to purge old gear and rearm with modern kit . especially germany has to restructure its military , and this is a golden opportunity to do just that ."
12674,more like america has a chance to weaken a strategic adversary with little harm to itself . europe is taking the brunt of the repercussions .
12675,you understimate the importance of gas significantly
12676,"war destroys capital and assets , making it a very effective weapon against price inflation . it's the shock doctrine , writ large across eastern europe ."
12677,have we tried ignoring it more ?
12678,"it also got what it wanted in 2008 in georgia . the shit russia is pulling in ukraine ain't new . it has happened since modern russia appeared and it intervene in 1991 in moldova on the secessionist side . so . yeah . allow russia to get away with literal murder , and they will murder again . and each time with a bigger fish ' til the fucker decides to attack nato and we all die in a nuclear holocaust ."
12679,the united states didnt pledge more than $ 40 billion in military aid last time . the british government didnt send brimstone missile systems last time . finland and sweden didnt join nato last time . the world is definitely treating this differently . and last time is actually the reason this time is going so well . nato trainers completely turned the ukrainian military around and built a solid nco corps .
12680,"my opinion is that if push come to shove with china invading tiwan , both the us and eu will not put in place the same level of sanctions as they did with russia , since that would hurt them very heavily as well . i also think china knows this and so isn't gonna be afraid of those sanctions as much as you are suggesting"
12681,we are far less likely to do with china what we have done with russia . russias role in the us economy is literally nothing compared to china .
12682,they could also make a call for asia to unite .
12683,sounds ridiculous but that's literally the same thing people said about hitler when he invaded poland as justification for not getting involved .
12684,transnistria in moldova is next . then maybe tries pushing luck with some of the former soviet nato's if they can destabilize .
12685,south ossetia and abkhazia were the warning signs a decade ago . the problem is europe wants a free ride . the eu demonizes americans as warmongers but the second there is a problem europe expects american dollars and lives to be paid to resolve it . im tired of europe getting a free ride . the eu needs to pull its weight when it comes to nato and global affairs .
12686,if hes not dead . perhaps .
12687,lol maybe not paris but seeing germany's military i bet they could actually make it to berlin if no one comes to germany's aid
12688,that must make the uk the sauna these days then .
12689,there's a reason ukraine is called the gates of europe
12690,"while speaking about the european parliament , stoltenberg said that eu member states should all want to financially support the country as it fends off attacks from russian president vladimir putin's army , according to the kyiv post . "" the price we pay as the european union , as nato , is the price we can measure in currency , in money ,"" he said . "" the price [ ukrainians ] pay is measured in lives lost every day . stoltenberg , who has been nato's secretary general since 2014 , added : "" we should stop complaining and step up and provide support , full stop ."" the post article , which was published tuesday , did not specify when and where stoltenberg made these comments , and newsweek was not immediately able to confirm those details . nato was contacted to verify the date and context of the secretary general's remarks . since putin's army invaded ukraine on february 24 , the eu has passed six packages of sanctions against russia , with the latest including a ban on 90 percent of russian crude oil imports . in may , the eu proposed offering a loan of 9 billion euros , about $ 9.5 billion , in financial assistance to ukraine , reuters reported , but this has yet to be finalized ."
12691,"its not . russia uses propaganda to install proxy leaders in our democracies and interfere with our politics . it's a threat to your sovereignty . i think brexit and anti-vax . because it's people propagandized to weigh existential threat over a credible problem . the uk is spending on blocking russian propaganda in the uk . it's not labeled but this is what it looks like . and then there's a physical threat . russia is hellbent on connecting ukraine with belarus which is this really long western front and then they're holding back a lot of firepower and materials and we don't know why . ukraine's military is built for russia invading , that's it . whereas russia's military is built for fighting nato . you want russia to fight ukraine , you don't want russia to come face to face with europe . next is poland and that's why poland is helping ukraine with all it's ability . it doesn't have the option to let russia roll ukraine . what were you thinking ? it was charity or some global conspiracy to increase military spending ? read the room ."
12692,it's not just for europe either . the world really is on the tip of another massive wave of imperialism and you bet china is watching how we all react to this very closely .
12693,is that sarcasm or not ?
12694,"russia can't take ukraine who are training on nato weapon systems on the fly , they aren't invading any nato countries ."
12695,"its pretty hyperbole . if russia takes ukraine , russia will need years to rebuild its military and continue through europe . and most of europe is boosting its military funding right now , unless russia used their nukes or china joined in , no way they could take the rest of europe . and within a few years , your supply lines will have been rebuilt to not rely on russia ."
12696,"wrong statements in a clickbait title and many people just blindly eat it up and say it's "" spot on "" just proves once again that reddit is just as shit as other social medias"
12697,are you counting only humanitarian aid ? or including military aid ? as the uk has given 1.5 billion ($ 1.8 billion ) in humanitarian aid and 2.3 billion ($ 2.7 billion ) in military aid . thats as of june 2022 . not sure if more had been sent/promised since .
12698,"uk is a primary supporter of ukraine of the eu countries . usa is number 1 richest economy in the world and uk is 6th richest economy . we share military intelligence and allow us military bases in our country and aircraft . instead of making this a bullshit competition go look at ways to bring people together and actually see the truth which is we have a mutual collaboration which is very positive . the uk is also training ukrainian soldiers , providing military hardware including starstreak missiles and british constructed stingers which have been invaluable boris johnson has been to ukraine twice whilst the war is ongoing and we'll keep training and supporting ukraine until ukraine defeats russia ."
12699,"to be fair , if there's one thing the americans have in abundance ( and there are many ) it's military hardware . most of which was sitting in surplus waiting for a war with russia that was never going to come . now you're just sending it off to ukraine so that ukrainians can use it for what it was always intended for . to be clear , i am in no way marginalizing american material support to ukraine . it is worthy of gratitude and respect from the entire world . but the us has an economy almost 6 times the size , the uk is busy unfucking their own asses after brexit , and a lot of the american aid was just stuff they already had kicking around . they've provided material aid , including a truly amazing manpad system . they're doing a lot more than most other european countries ."
12700,"the uk has literally been training and supplying ukraine since 2015 as part of operation orbital , has shipped out a vast amount of weapons and support including $ 4.6 billion in military equipment . we also have a program housing refugees in the uk . calculating via gdp the us has given 0.1 % while the uk has given 0.17 %. none of this even matters though because were close allies fighting hard towards a common goal . maybe leave the division and misinformation to russia ."
12701,both the us and the uk are doing the right thing .
12702,"uk is at $ 3.5 billion now , as a share of gdp it's actually a little ahead of the us . germany and france are the ones dragging their feet ."
12703,i dont think you can measure billion per billion and the uk isnt the problem . they are americas closest ally and have stepped up to help us . its germany and france that are sucking the wind out of the sail . which is what i said months ago before a few fanboys came to the rescue with excuses . the time for excuses are over . its time for action . no more bs talk .
12704,"honey uk is no longer in the eu , they're part of nato but those are separate things that's what brexit was about . ( this address was to eu from the nato secretary general , not to nato btw )"
12705,hey i bet russia has some of the highest rates of fetal alcohol syndrome as well !
12706,"biden has far surpassed all expectations i had for him . granted , they were pretty low , but us is basically a shining beacon of hope for europe at the moment . that's so wild , considering the world just 2 years ago ."
12707,"same here . im not a fan of either us president , but im glad that biden is pushing our legislators to funnel money and weapons to ukraine ."
12708,"i feel trump could have gone 100 % either way on this . part of his instinct would be to not get involved . maybe get some concessions out of russia in exchange for not intervening . but then again , it could have been an opportunity to rally a ton of support . republicans , lockheed et al , all super happy . not to mention european leaders who would badly depend on him , which trump would love . ( hed also get to gloat about how he told them to increase military spending )."
12709,the same trump that was constantly going on about increasing defense budgets in europe and them becoming independent of russian gas ?
12710,"welcome to democracy . every intelligent man eventually realises this massive flaw in the system . this is a big reason career politicians shouldn't exist . their livelihood depends on being elected ; not on ruling with the nation's best interest in mind . people who make tough calls that have short-term negative impact on s big part of the population will in many cases be voted out . then , in an absolutely hilarious turn of events , the populist gouvernment that succeeds them will very likely reap the benefits of the former gouvernment's plan , as they will be apparent later on . democracy , in the form it is currently implemented in most countries , is detrimental for a nation . the illusion of having a say in gouvernment is its only positive . sadly , you have the same agency with easily manipulated idiots , who outnumber you by quite a number ."
12711,"> most likely by someone with big , empty promises . kinda like desantis using the word "" bidenflation "" all the time . i guarantee you if this war is still happening in 2024 and a republican wins , a serious effort to leave nato will be made ."
12712,"that has often been the problem . good generals who told the truth in wwi got replaced with ones who were more aggressive and kills a lot of men . people want to think what fits their bias . you are a person , so that means you too want to hear what fits your bias ' be aware of that and look for ways to find out if you are wrong and admit it ."
12713,> they are the ones who's next on the menu if russia gobbles up ukraine yeahhh so that's not going to happen even if they take the entirety of ukraine .
12714,"i'm not sure where you're getting that other parts of europe aren't helping . everyone has been sending weapons , money , medical supplies , food , etc to ukraine . sometimes in package deals ."
12715,if you are west of poland you don't need to worry that much about a conventional war because whatever frontline country is getting invaded + the us is more than enough to win a conventional war against russia . so you already have your security blanket . by comparison eastern european nations that might get invaded have every incentive to help the ukrainians destroy the russian military .
12716,"france and germany form the economic backbone of the eu , and germany's leadership in helping the euro weather 2008 was specifically because of its strong industrial sector fueled by russian gas . if germany gets too hawkish on russia and provokes a cold turkey gas withdrawal , the whole of europe goes to shit"
12717,"a lot of european countries have been in denial about needing to invest in military infrastructure . macron has been talking for years about the eu needing to be able protect its own sovereignty to deaf ears . if i had to wager a guess , its because most european countries aren't interested in raising taxes further or cutting social spending to pay for their military . after all , hey , if america is willing to foot the bill on defense , why waste our own money ?"
12718,yeah i do think that some of the western eu is living in a cozy bubble where nothing bad happens to them . the gas should have been cut immediately and now the russians are abusing it because a clear weakness was shown that cutting it was not in the talks . maybe putin was right that the west is weak and too comfortable . the consequences of your own actions should have been met with resolve instead of letting genocide happen right next door .
12719,it's 300 billion not 300 trillion .
12720,the easiest would be to tax all russian oil and gas exports and send the money to ukraine .
12721,"> the last thing they will think about is the suffering of ukranian people , with all due respect . that's exactly the point . we need people to think ahead even slightly . if we let russia seize land from ukraine , how will this impact europe 5 years later ? 10 years later ? yes , it's going to suck with the economy being slightly rougher for a while , but it's a lot better than it being completely destroyed down the line . the reality is that the number of people being put under financial stress will go up , but there have to be other solutions to that than going easy on russia ."
12722,"when the governments in easter europe start to fall in winter due to economies regressing back a decade or more and more orban-like figures take over , west will have the shockest pikachu face and wonder how that happened ..."
12723,"you do realise that it was market force which got germany to buy russian gas . if it weren't for cheap russian gas , you wouldn't have those factories you have today which are going to be fail due to high gas prices . eu's economy is built on cheap energy provided by russia , if that energy wasn't historically there you'd just end up with a weaker economy , not with the same economy built upon some magical alternative energy source ."
12724,"well some people want to just reach peace asap no matter the conditions ( aka save putin'a face ) and then pretend everything is back to normal , cheap gas and stuff . which is dumb af"
12725,"the prices are not just because of the war . maybe not even primarily due to the war . coming out of covid theres a massive surge in demand which is currently unmet . the us also cut the hell out of their production for some reason , and saudi/opec are keeping supplies tight to keep prices high ."
12726,"> so lets say europe doesn't help ukraine . how would that help gas prices ? it would stop them from increasing at a faster rate . russia supplies a lot of oil and gas to the eu . if they cut that off , they need to find an alternative source . any alternative source is invariably going to be more expensive , and due to global shortages , it's going to push prices up even further . > the faster the war is over , the quicker gas prices will normalize . at this point that means you either want russia to win or ukraine to win . while theoretically true , there's nothing that suggests that the eu completely cutting off russia would end the war any quicker than doing nothing at all . at best , it will force putin to nationalize the economy into a war-time economy , which * might * trigger some form of rebellion , but probably won't do shit ( after all , they already had their elections subverted and those protests went nowhere , why would returning to ussr economic standards have any greater impact ?). so long as asian , african , and south american countries are still willing to trade with russia , russia can survive the sanctions from the west pretty much indefinitely , albeit at a reduced standard of living . anyone thinking that the eu still buying oil and gas from russia is the last thread holding russia together and that cutting that off would force a collapse of russia is delusional . if anything , the economic hardship brought on by that would simply make joining the army a better proposition for russians , which just makes the problem worse . so the argument is basically "" pay a lot more for oil and gas , experience shortages and economic contraction , and maaaaaybe the war will end a few months earlier than it would otherwise , but maybe not "". most people would rather just avoid that kind of hardship altogether . after all , there's no world in which russia tries to go toe-to-toe with nato that doesn't involve nuclear weapons , and if it gets to that point , things like "" how much is my heating bill going to be this winter "" or "" how long will this war drag on "" become somewhat meaningless . even if ukraine falls , most eu countries aren't under any kind of serious threat , other than nuclear , which they can't really do anything about ."
12727,you think putin is stopping at ukraine if he wins ?
12728,"if russia wins , theyre not going to stop . putin has made clear he has no respect for sovereignty , no respect for self-determination . he would immediately invade another neutral country . russia borders a lot of countries ."
12729,> gasoline was already sky rocketing long before the war started . no they weren't . you can't just lie like that lol
12730,"i'm convinced we don't even remotely know the extent to which russia is subverting all sorts of societies world wide to sow division , chaos & confusion . in 1-2 decades from now , we will probably look back at russia and wonder *"" why did we just sit back and watch for so long while they were actively trying to burn this planet down ?""* the obvious answer would probably be "" nukes "", but if the end result is just a different flavor of apocalypse anyway , i don't see much merit to the argument of a hypothetical apocalypse anymore ."
12731,"it doesnt matter what we think , it matters what the people of russia think . with enough support of the russian public putin can escalate this "" special military operation "" into a full blow war which would allow him to send far more troops . the less support putin has the more likely protests will start making it more difficult to keep his invasion going ."
12732,"jens stoltenberg is a politician and as most other politicians he does what is good for himself . look at his predecessor anders fogh rasmussen . he got his position as nato chief by involving denmark in every us conflict imaginable . then he became nato chief he did exactly as stoltenberg . now he runs an international company , offering policy and pr help to countries and companies around the world . guess who his companies first big client was ? that's right . ukrain after the 2014 coup ."
12733,"the nationality of the secretary matters how ...? i don't agree with op , but suggesting that nato doesn't represent us interests because the secretary is not american ..."
12734,sneed
12735,"and money is super critical . honestly rebuilding the german army is a pretty crappy investment compared to bankrolling the ukrainian goverment or even underwriting polish / romanian military . a euro will get you greater return on investment in poland/ukraine than germany , you get the return on investment today , and if you stop russia in ukraine or at the polish border germany has no need for a military ."
12736,so yea give me your smart calculation with refugees and tank switch with various eu countries and also the money from the eu that comes partially from germany . maybe calculate everything before making a stupid comment
12737,"i hate this kind of exceptionalist bullshit . one of my largest single complaints about us foreign relations is the policy that america never apologizes . we'll "" express regret "" that something bad happened to you , we'll pay millions of dollars to the families of people we accidentally killed , but we can't just straight up apologize for fucking up . it's the most obnoxious arrogance . if i expected the same from a european country , germany is probably where i'd have called it , but it's disappointing to see anyway ."
12738,have you ever listened to a full uncut speech by putin about ukraine ? maybe you should
12739,they wouldnt be able to get through poland
12740,"right , and nato is underpinned by the us military , and the us is seeing the consequences of europeans not spending on their defenses right now . germany needs like 6 months to resinstall windows on their m270s , they barely have anything to offer . same with the rest of the nato allies . it's frustrating . yes the us has deep inventory , no question about it , but we're over on the other side of the world , europeans should have had the capability to support the war effort with minimal lead time ."
12741,that will never happen it did and it will
12742,those are nato memebers so it won't happen .........
12743,not sucking bidens balls . thats for sure
12744,this is misinformation in action . the oil execs have been bitching and moaning on fox news about how the democrats won't grant them leases for years to manipulate idiots in to fighting for them
12745,"i dunno , i hear a lot more europeans whining about america than vice versa . the average american has no problem with europe"
12746,"oh it still means something , just not the same something ."
12747,[ cries in reader's digest ]
12748,"seeing what its like now , i wish itd been completely killed off . instead its turned into a zombie thats just shuffling around , a parody of what it once was . even back then , it wasnt as good as time and some other magazines , but it was at least a legitimate news source . now ? yeesh "
12749,"i'd call that a source , federaleurope !"
12750,"remember the "" varou-fakis "" incident where german journalist and comedy show host jan bhmermann created a fake video of greek politician yanis varoufakis that showed him giving people the middle finger and supposedly saying rude things ? it got circulated all over the news and new video popped up regularly of him doing other "" vile "" gestures and saying rude things . turns out it was to show how easy it is to fake video sources and make it seem like this happened that didnt happen . they documented everything and showed the original which ironically , was called "" fake "" when it got discovered before they admitted to faking it . dont believe videos ... * [ source ]( the source is a german clip from jan bhmermann from his show , but you can enable english subtitles to get the proof ."
12751,"best counterargument i can muster is that journalists want a written or otherwise external confirmation from the body that he represents that he said what he said . when making strong statements like that there may be some sort of ' professional courteousness "" in permitting powerful organizations to back out of statements by saying the speaker was drunk or something . somehow speaking out of alignment with the will of the organization . it stands to reason that an organization like nato could have coordinated a "" mulligan "" policy with the press ; to safeguard against rogue agents . something akin to "" if he's not repeating something we already put in public statement then we'd like to review it before you claim it to be official "" i confess that i pulled all that directly from my ass , and it was largely a fun exercise in spin-doctoring ."
12752,they haven't yet . the gas line is down for maintenance and it is unknown if russia will continue to supply gas when the maintenance is complete .
12753,"like , soon . there's some maintenance and expectation is russia will claim they can't restart delivery due to bogus reason . then there's some gas pump or part or somesuch . the expectation is russia will say can't deliver f gas without that , except the plan was for that to be delivered in september or something to that effect . can't 100 % remember details and too lazy to look it up atm edit , falling asleep , can't even type without fucking up"
12754,"they did not cut off all gas , but one , the nord stream 1 for "" maintenance "". there is still russian gas coming to europe ."
12755,"lol they already are begging for it , sending turbines and breaking sanctions"
12756,"yep . russia's "" cope cages "" didn't stop javelins , and we get to know that for sure because the ukrainians are serving us photo evidence of destroyed russian tanks with distinctive holes through the cages . you don't get that kind of certainty in a lab . it's also giving us the chance to see how a modern war really plays out . like , nato has a doctrine of absolute air dominance and probably has the tools to achieve it , but if we failed to do that , it would look like what's happening in ukraine right now . which is a brutal artillery slugging match . and i think that's caught a lot of analysts by surprise , because we don't actually have that much artillery to give them ."
12757,it was always supposed to be a two way economic weapon . europe takes the risk of being dependent on russian gas . russia is now dependent on european gas money . it's mutually assured destruction without the nukes . unfortunately russia called the bluff
12758,"thats generally how seasons work , yes ."
12759,"we just have to open our windows during the day tomorrow , then keep them closed until winter is over . there you go , no heating needed"
12760,death valley also gets pretty cold at night 
12761,"with climate change , most people only think about the average temperature rise . the thing is the amount of variation is also increasing . each year around the world , the weather is getting more extreme , not just heat but other things like rain , storms and cold snaps . here in australia our fire seasons are getting worse , now we've got flooding all over the place and getting colder than usual ."
12762,"if the summer is really hot , then the winter is generaly also really cold that year . i cant speak of western europe but thats how it is in eastern europe . shits probably gonna hit - 35 or more without doubt . but atleast eastern europe doesn't rely on gas boilers or electric heaters . most apartment buildings get their hot water for radiators and showers from a central boiler room that is operated by a couple of peope from early morning to like midnight to keep all the apartment buildings in nearby area warm and supply water for showers etc . and most private homes either have some sort of stone furnance indoors or their own central heating system that relies purely on timber ."
12763,"hot air goes into the artic . cold air in the artic gets displaced and moves south . for reasons beyond me it's likely to go to usa , hence texas getting cold . weather be complicated ."
12764,"not in europe , but where i live there is over 60c / 110f degrees of difference between summer and winter , so yeah , it can get bad ."
12765,"and europe is importing lng from usa , so they make money there too aside from the lend-lease deals with ukraine and the likely post-war reconstruction contracts . as far as the americans are concerned , war is business and business is good ."
12766,"which will make it more pliable to us pressure . a good ally is a weakened "" ally ""."
12767,what about caring for a little bit then ignoring it again ? that usually works for me
12768,"yes and no . the response was way more powerful thats true , but so was the infraction . problem is the support for that seems to be waning in europe as the economic fallout becomes clear . if they don't suck it up now , the message won't get through and we can expect russia to continue its behavior"
12769,"my opinion is that , push come to shove , the us confronts china in direct military conflict over taiwan . taiwan is strategically crucial in the naval encirclement of china , economically crucial to the most powerful corporations on the planet , and politically crucial as an exterior threat every politician will want to be seen confronting . china invading taiwan will make support for ukraine look like "" thoughts and prayers ""."
12770,"except a majority of electronics are made in taiwan . an invasion by china would not only cripple our economy regardless of sanctions , it would also give the ccp a near monopoly on technological advancement for the next decade . not something the us can allow if they don't wonna become a servant of bei jing ."
12771,except usa would join the fight in taiwan . it's way worse than the west just giving ukraine aid .
12772,"at the same time , the us's role in china's economy also isn't nothing ."
12773,"plus , while russia might not be capable of pulling a nazi germany on europe , other nations are watching . if russia were to be allowed to get away with this , even if their options for further aggression are limited , it tells china that they can pull the same thing without consequence . now , while china's capabilities in this area are unproven i'd put betting money they'd be more successful than russia ."
12774,"you mean czechoslovakia , once germany invaded poland that pulled the uk into the war"
12775,thats before icbms

12780,"europe was staunchly against admiting ukraine into nato because it was a stated red line of russia's . the us and uk really started pushing it at the 2008 bucharest summit when it was announced that georgia would start joining nato to which russia imeadiately invaded . before the end of the summit putin said if ukraine joins nato it will be without the east and south parts of the country . the us and uk kept telling ukraine that could join and russia wouldn't do shit ... i don't know if the us helped organize or provoke the coup but russia sure does and its kind of america's party trick . us politicians from both parties rush to congragulate and emboldened the new givernment . 2014 the new ukraine government revokes protections of minority languages ( russian ), russia invades crimea the next day . none of this makes the invasion any less evil but there is a clear pattern of aggrivation and recipricole escalation to which russia has followed through with exactly what they said they would while the us and uk constantly encouraged ukraine to call their bluffs . had america stayed out of it and let europe make its own choices i'd say they should foot the bill but they didn't ."
12781,send germany 5000 helmets and heavy artillery ( after we sort out several months of paperwork first !)
12782,... and help ukraine
12783,lol since when ? never heard that
12784,and he's absolutely correct . if eu pours money into the war it can have just as big of an effect as bullets . it could even allow ukraine to train soldiers on some modern western equipment instead of being stuck with older soviet tech just because they know how to use it .
12785,"spot on . europe is in an existential crisis atm and besides all you said russia has been blocking grain shipments in order to create a food problem for middle east and north africa . that food problem will bring consequences so big that it will make the arab spring and migrant crisis look like kindergarden . once conflicts begin many of those 2 billion people will head for europe .... migrations have always created conflicts in history ... europe is in for a fight , one way or another ."
12786,"> they're holding back a lot of firepower and materials and we don't know why they actually aren't . russia is out of combat ready troops and vehicles . they have to activate vehicles from the 50s and reassign ship crews and airforce airmen ( not pilots , low ranks ) into motorized infantry . if they had firepower and materials they would apply it to ukraine because they literally can't afford to lose here ."
12787,"> the uk is spending on blocking russian propaganda in the uk and then you have the u.s ., which has fallen so far under russian influence that one political party promotes russian propaganda , and actively fights to enable more of it in social media ."
12788,"> they're holding back a lot of firepower and materials and we don't know why who is , russia ? how do we know that they aren't using all of their resources ?"
12789,"sure . on the one hand we are to believe that russia struggles to keep the war going , on the other hand they will of course attack poland next , a nato country . what a farce ."
12790,this response could stop a new wave of imperialism before it starts .
12791,germany seems pretty pathetic on it's own . i bet a few others are in a similar situation internally .
12792,"the uk has literally been training and supplying ukraine since 2015 as part of operation orbital , has shipped out a vast amount of weapons and support including $ 4.6 billion in military equipment and aid . we also have a program housing refugees in the uk . calculating via gdp the us has given 0.1 % while the uk has given 0.17 %. none of this even matters though because were close allies fighting hard towards a common goal . weird and incorrect stance to take by this guy ."
12793,"also , to put it into a bit more stark contrast , there's a lot of equipment that ukraine needs that the uk just doesn't have in quantity . according to oryx , russia has lost 871 tanks ( destroyed or captured ) so far . the entire british inventory of tanks numbers 227 . the us with our 8,725 tanks could ( just to be ridiculous ) hand over a thousand abrams to ukraine and have not even started pulling active duty tanks from regiments ."
12794,what ? the uk isnt in the eu .
12795,"also nlaws , which ( last i saw ) the ukrainian military estimates account for between 30 % and 40 % of russian tank "" kills ""."
12796,it certainly would have helped if the other nato nations had actually invested the 2 % gdp guideline in their military instead of naively assuming that war was a thing of the past . the only countries that come anywhere close to pulling their weight are [ the uk and france ](
12797,that war might come sooner than you think .
12798,"the us was there too in 2015 , the dude's an idiot but us/uk/canada were heavily involved in arming/training the ukrainian forces ."
12799,too bad dear merkel ruins it all
12800,> germany and france are the ones dragging their feet . this is also not true . the statistics shown usually splits germany's direct contribution and those done via eu into two separate bar's to make sure the uk comes out on top . if you consider that germany funds 25 % of the eu which then sends their own help germany does more than the uk and france & uk do the same . classic uk media trick to make the uk look better for the lazy reader . edit : here is a good list of graphs to show things from different perspectives .
12801,"the french and germans have been very supportive . apparently these guys were just horribly unprepared for this kind of thing . further they seem to be moving to a war footing about as slowly as the russians push to kyiv . and yeah there's an energy crisis to boot . without taking the energy crisis into consideration , i'm told it'll take about 3 years before tanks and arty roll off the assembly line ."
12802,not true germany has like 700000 people from ukraine living in their country . alone this costs 2 billion . then help through the eu which is also money that comes partially from germany . also old soviet tanks are sent from different countries for free exchange for german weapons . all these things are not calculated into the bill from germany . how many refugees did the uk take ? like 200 ?
12803,"ukraine is like 5000 miles from the us , how exactly would that work"
12804,honey the uk doesn't have the ability to drive its island to north america . europe's problems are still their problems .
12805,"good thing the uk isnt part of europe anymore , otherwise they might have been in danger ! / s"
12806,that's south africa holding the 1st place
12807,democracy is the worst system accept for all the others .
12808,the us leaving nato is the dumbest fucking thing ive heard all week . come on man 
12809,no chance of leaving nato . but the us might demand that others contribute more
12810,"no dude . eastern european/baltic nations have functional brains and joined a defensive alliance , so they didn't need to fight a war at all . look at estonia , lithuania and latvia those tiny bits of land . those would've been the first logical places to conquer , not the massive ukraine with an equally massive population . logic ! it f \*\*\*\*\* works !"
12811,"nah . if the government took 80 % of everyone's money and just stuffed it in a vault , prices would fall everywhere because no one could afford the old . the amount of usable money is important ."
12812,[ how banks create money ](
12813,"is russia so weak that it can defeated by merely supporting ukraine or is russia so threatening that they can destroy the entirety of europe somehow if they win in ukraine ? doesnt make sense , if the second is true then russia would still win even with all the help ukraine is getting ."
12814,"while i agree with you on that , the government before merkel already realised that climate change is a thing and we needed to start progressing out of carbon based energy sources . they made a pretty good effort to do exactly that . merkel however reverted all that ( google altmaier knick )."
12815,i mean this is very easy to say if youre living in a country with massive energy reserves . but europe really doesnt have any huge oil fields or gas wells like the us .
12816,"it's likely the sanctions are affecting their war readiness greatly . their ability to produce high tech equipment is hamstrung by import restrictions . even if they can evade restrictions in small quantities by smuggling or going through third parties , a kinetic war involving hundreds of thousands of soldiers like ukraine needs * massive * amounts of logistics . they are probably firing tens of thousands of artillery shells per day . if they had unrestricted imports , they could fly more sorties with planes , launch more guided missiles , and generally have more high tech weapons at their disposal . so the sanctions are indeed helping on the ground ."
12817,"yes . what reasons does putin have to invade a nato country ? to get nuked ? just put finland in nato and there is 0 threat to anyone outside of ukraine . how do you people simultaneously manage to acknowledge that nato exists , yet also pretend that it doesn't exist , at the same time ?"
12818,"no , i don't . he wants at least all of the former soviet union . i'm pointing out that appeasing putin won't help gas prices ."
12819,thats how the middle east thinks about the us .
12820,you're stupid if you think europe wants russia to expand its territory .
12821,fuck off back to 4chan
12822,"what exatly do you want germany to apologize for ? for trying to not cause a war with a nation which suffered heavily by german hands ? and guess what , "" wandel durch handel "" worked amasingly well , much better than most of americas gun boat politics ."
12823,"dude does not recognize ukraine as a sovereign country . anything else worthy of notice ? oh yeah , ukrainian people are lesser . oh forgot that he also said that current government and previous one are not legit . what else ? that he is absolutely delusional about actual economics ?"
12824,that doesn't matter today .
12825,ukrainians did a majority of the fighting actually leading to a population loss .
12826,the uk and france do have that capability also the uk has been very busy helping ukraine but you seem to be conveniently ignoring that . also weird europe is bad especially germany when germany will be spending 150 billion on its military next year making it the 3rd highest spender by a large margin
12827,this thread if full of americans complaining about europeans .
12828,the average american can't even locate europe on a fucking map lmao .
12829,"i think this is one of those karma bots that repeats other people's comments in a random place of the same comments section . it's totally out of place . downvote and move along . edit : yep , u/abominationally posted this exact comment 4 hours ago further down in the comment section . downvote , report and move along ."
12830,"thanks , preparedforzombies !"
12831,"> the gas line is down for maintenance so they have :) i mean i know what you mean , they didn't specifically say "" from now on no gas for you "", but they did stop supplying , they did say "" maybe we won't be able to continue ""."
12832,""" we're not cutting off your gas . it's a special maintenance operation ."""
12833,"but they have already claimed less than a day ago that gas is going to be sent again after maintenance , no ? we'll have to wait and see . i believe they said it will still be limited like before july 11th , though . edit : and not like they can be trusted . if they continue selling gas to europe then i'm sure they will limit it so we barely scrape by and then cut it completely when it gets cold . i just think it's realistic that they will resume gas flows after maintenance ."
12834,"they won't cut it , they are not dummies . i swear you guys , you are gluttons for war time propaganda . there were never a chance that they will cut it because that is how they hold europe by the b . they are a strong ally to germany's ( especially ) industry , a lot of europe but especially germans want to see the war over as soon as possible . the americans and consequently , nato , don't . the longer it goes , the weaker both russia and europe gets , it's the old american adage , "" let them fight it out , and after a while , we swoop in as the saviors of the slightly more well off side "". i like to be cynical about this , and probably i should be , but honestly it has happened so many times in history ( one way or another ) that my only worry is why people do not see it for what it is . i honestly doubt that americans and nato in particular care about the ukrianias , they hardly cared about the chechens when the very same guy razed their capital in the late ' 90s . it's all geopolitics and spheres of influence for them , and the poor ukrainians are caught in the middle . for as long as we have a world built in such a way that "" spheres of influence "" is a good enough reason to murder people then we'd get more syrias , ukraines , ossetias , iraqi ... oh and the reason ( for the invasion ) would always be different ... yet always the same , the strong pick off the little guys . the un can/could only work if it was coming down * hard * to any place where battle was about to erupt . that was its point , to stop future wars , anything else and imperial powers would continue doing their i perialistic sh*t ( hong kong , taiwan , on the other side of the globe and a slew of others too )..."
12835,"eventually with the sanctions , they will have very real problems with production ."
12836,"its actual maintenance , though ."
12837,you mean returning turbines haha .. can't have it both ways right ? demand they send gas and not give them back their parts
12838,absolutely . plus also seeing how the russians wage a ' real ' war . its absolutely shattered some preconceptions . the russians enjoyed the soviet rep for waging war . undeservedly as it turned out . an example is their shocking lack of comms security . flat out not using many ew assets it seems . its blown some massive holes in russian propaganda . it stunned even them . their shills etc took like a month to recover . of course all good things end . now i have clowns here telling me that * of course * the drive on kyiv was a feint . oh and those airborne units totally destroyed were part of it doncha know
12839,tossers expediant and nieve i feel .
12840,"i'll be honest , the heat has gotten to my brain ."
12841,"europe isn't a desert though . well , at least not yet ."
12842,"yes , we absolutely love paying way more for our fuel because europe saw no possible issues could come from climbing into bed with putin ."
12843,"stop , i can only get so complacent"
12844,how would we even support taiwan if china invaded ? wouldn't the whole island be put under a naval blockade immediately ?
12845,"do you think that the corporations pull out of china like they did with russia ? or would they just try to find every damned excuse to continue to do business in china , because they'd rather sell out everything to the ccp and constantly risk their ip ( which they seem to still not get the hint for ) for those extra few zeros ?"
12846,"absolutely , their financial systems are struggling right now as it is , they couldnt handle a war either ."
12847,"they dont really need the war machine as much as the nazi's did . theyre offensive forces can be pretty lackluster so long as any retreat comes along with the threat of "" stop or we nuke "". do the nukes work ? would they actually use them ? idk . russia is basically holding a grenade under a cloth robbing a store and we all gotta guess if its real or not"
12848,no but at full mobilization they could very likely become match the soviet war machine again which also started shambles and eventually became a force to be reckoned with .
12849,"how is that not being sympathetic ? it's plain numbers . italian deaths in iraq and afghanistan measure in the dozens while the us measures in the thousands . it's barely comparable . every life lost is terrible , but that's not his argument . his argument is that the eu at large wants all of the benefits that american military presence brings , while frequently criticizing said military presence , only to turn around and beg for that military presence when shit hits the fan . when looked at in basically any way ( percentage of gdp or total ), the us is far outspending to defend the eu than eu member nations . while i'm not saying each eu member nation needs to spend as much as the us ( not happening ), their percentage contribution needs to drastically increase . that's what he was getting at . it's not insensitive to point out that countries like italy that want the protections granted by us military presence need to contribute . people die in war and the only reason that the number of italian deaths is so low is because us military spending and us military personnel took the brunt of the action and act as a deterrent from overt military action from a nation like russia ."
12850,i mean tbf it was only 53...and us has always kept europe safe with 100k soldiers in europe
12851,"oh please . dont count us out yet . god has a special providence for fools , drunkards , and the united states of america ."
12852,"yeah us is the untrustworthy one,unlike the pinnacle of trust germany is which is still funding russia and built fucking ns2 after crimea.europe needs to stop patting itself in the back seeing as they are the one who bent over backwards for russia and now the bill comes due.enjoy the insane gas prices i guess and i hope you don't freeze this winter"
12853,about the same time they started calling it the gondor of europe
12854,"~~ hey , stop shitting on wishful thinking !~~ ~~ have some empathy for those sitting in the comfort of their mom's basement , with free food and electricity , making up shit to feel good about themselves !~~ ukraine is actually called the gates of europe . aint nobody making any shit up ."
12855,> once conflicts begin many of those 2 billion people will head for europe spot on !
12856,"it's a bit of a tricky one if you can argue denial of resources is a pretext for war . japan might say that the us denying them oil created an existential crisis for them during ww2 , and forced them to attack . venezuela might say economic sanctions against them regarding oil purchases created an existential crisis also . a rival government in exile was even set up ( forgotten about now though ). at the end of the day russia has the right to sell to friends and not sell to enemies . ukraine can sell to whoever they want , using the means available to them . both are aspects of sovereignty ."
12857,europe won't stand for another 2015 migrant surge . better get used to it .
12858,"i feel like that's the least of concerns at the moment , we're going to be seeing ocean kill off like never before soon enough . the ripple effects will devastate life on earth as we know it ."
12859,"russia isn't technically at war , like vietnam and the us air force being very limited on what targets they could officially hit (, minus the shadow war ). they have the same rules about what can be allocated and what has to be approved . putin isn't a god . he still has to play by their internal politics . so they can't fully mobilize nor do they want to pull away certain units from certain areas to send to ukraine . many of the russian troops in ukraine are from the east as well ."
12860,"the conservative party is hugely owned by russia . dirty money keeps it afloat , and it does a lot of russia's bidding . one of boris ' scandals was making a son of a kgb agent a lord and also meeting them at dodgy parties without police escort . the uk launders lots of dirty russian money , largely through property . russia put a lot of dirty money into the brexit campaign . when the government investigated russian influence in politics , the conclusion basically was ' we didn't find any , but we didn't look .' also , fascinatingly , the right wing media smeared the labour candidate as russian , russia linked , a soviet at any turn ; even photoshopping an ushanka with hammer and sickle onto him and sticking him infront of the red square as a background . the corruption and manipulation runs very deep here , people are much less aware of it than trump and putin ."
12861,"were lucky that we ( us ) love being arms dealers this time , every gifted munition is an excuse to buy more ."
12862,sadly sometimes i forget that fact .
12863,you worded that ( intentionally ?) weirdly uk and france both exceed 2 %. they are pulling there weight completely not ' coming anywhere close '
12864,> the only countries that come anywhere close to pulling their weight are the uk and france . this is false . your link just doesn't show many nato members - e.g . greece is at 3.76 % gdp .
12865,"the 2 % goal was set to be reached by 2024 . i know that americans ( especially trump voters ) love to quote this number to show how the other nato countries are not pulling their weight , but it's - hopefully unintentional - misleading . > one of the outcomes of the 2014 north atlantic treaty organization ( nato ) summit held in wales was the recommendation that allies should strive towards spending at least 2 % of their gross domestic product ( gdp ) on military expenditure by 2024 ^[ source ]("
12866,a war between russia and the us has only weapon that matters . nukes . the buildup of conventional weaponry for a conventional war was always just a quid pro quo . they were never actually going to fight each other with them . neither country has a first use policy ( though russia is slightly changing that policy ). both countries would 100 % engage in a first-use strike if they deemed it the strategically preferred outcome .
12867,hell yeah its a huge joint effort by numerous countries . which is why we should be disparaging russia and not each other .
12868,"i'm annoyed by how little humanitarian aid is show by poland . we literally shelter from war around 1.5-2m ukrainians in our homes . but then again on second thoughts , government hardly doing shit about it . it's mostly people helping on their own ."
12869,i'm glad you corrected every time in these threads its easy to see us and uk soft power completely overwhelming any european soft power leading to incorrect assumptions being made repeatedly
12870,"the uk has taken in the same amount of refugees has france , it also is currently training thousands of ukrainian trips on top of the 20,00 trained since 2014 as we as deploying the equipment well before an invasion started unlike some countries . also , arent most countries giving away soviet tanks in exchange for united states tanks ? pretty sure the largest recipient is poland and they are also getting a unit of british challenger 2s deployed in country whilst they wait for their replacements ."
12871,"germany has sent barely more than helmets . hell , in january they were actively blocking nato members sending weapons into ukraine . even last month germany blocked spain from sending leopard tanks to ukraine . what germany * does * send is 40 billion a year to russia for oil ."
12872,option ( a ): ukrainians are quite good swimmers and will just take the direct route . option ( b ): ukraine takes over the russian motherland all over to siberia and then quickly enters alaska .
12873,"while i get your sentiment , i would love to see russia attempt an amphibious assault of the uk . it would be more disastrous than cannae was for the romans ."
12874,take this upvote .
12875,"sweetie , i've put the kettle on ."
12876,"the uk has always had a weird relationship with "" the continent "". they're definitely in danger , but i was referencing the article itself , where he wasn't addressing "" europe "" but the eu parliament . the uk is part of nato but no longer is part of the eu parliament afaik ( maybe they still have representation ? brexit was messy )"
12877,then you haven't been paying attention . it's an issue that already has some republican support and our own former president wanted to do it .
12878,and rightly so .
12879,"right , but on the scale of the world economy , with an estimated >$ 40 trillion in various currencies , seizing russia's ~$ 300b and suddenly releasing it , assuming you treated it purely as new money instead of money that had been usable 6 months ago , you'd only be inflating the world markets by 0.75 %. but again , strictly speaking , the freezing of those assets would have acted as a deflationary 0.75 %, so it's not like you've actually done anything through this ."
12880,false dichotomy . russia is strong enough to raid and pillage various sovereign nations that surround it . it has the potential to be a lot stronger than it is now . resisting russia right now is an opportunity .
12881,"how do you infer "" eu wants russia all over it's land "" from "" i dislike the us ulterior motives "". i guess you're one of em ranch chuggers ."
12882,why is everyone so angry today ?
12883,"the war was already coming and everyone , including you , knew it . you resisted helping the victim defend itself and you resisted imposing consequences on the aggressor . in doing so you caused further suffering . but you know this , and demonstrate the original poster's point by defending it instead of admitting that mistake , and playing a disingenuous appeal to history when the nation you speak of is behaving exactly like the fascist germany you're claiming you want to avoid . who was the fascist yesterday is not as important as who is the fascist today ."
12884,you ever wonder why the west does not allow us to see russian news ? we are only allowed to see propaganda from one side . why is that ?
12885,"germany "" committed "" x amount for their military . due to how their procurement process works , with tons of litigation from competitor firms and time limited contract terms , we'll see how much of that actually gets spent . they've famously spent 10 years going through a testing process for new helmets , which had already been approved for the us military , to make sure that "" it fits german heads """

12894,the usa can produce enough oil for domestic consumption . if you are paying more because it's not nationalised and the free market prefers to sell to europe at a higher price then that's on you guys .
12895,china themselves would probably just blockade taiwan until they starved rather than invade .
12896,there were months of buildup before russia invaded ukraine and thered be months of buildup before china invaded taiwan . the us and taiwan could activate their defenses before an invasion by china .
12897,ive read that there are corporations that are still in russia now .
12898,scholz looks like he's going to turn that around at least . with a german government no longer cozy to the russians the direction in europe should improve . i also heard france is increasing spending and going to stop fucking around in the sahel so they can focus their military resources in eu .

12904,"that's all true , denial of resources could be a possible cassus belli if it's existential for a country , and a country should be free to choose who to sell to . these overlap a bit , sadly . however , in this case , russia is not only choosing who to sell to , but they are actively blockading ukraine's own ports knowing full well that grain is mostly going to middle east and north africa , so in this case int he very least russia is weaponizing ukraine's grain against the countries that need it most . europe , fortunately produces more than it eats , but i don't think they can feed almost 3 times their own population ."

12908,yup . it seems surreal .
12909,it's always worded like that from some ppl in usa . since usa spend so much over the top it makes ppl feel like anything less in percentage is mediocre .

12912,"i dont think so . mad has worked for a long time . losing some ground in a war is better than being completely destroyed . if one side was clearly losing , the other side would achieve a few strategic goals and then stop , because nukes would become a real threat if one side thought it was facing total defeat ."
12913,"wow the poorest answer imaginable , the same amount as a random other country . > it also is currently training thousands of ukrainian yeah who isnt .. > also , arent most countries giving away soviet tanks in exchange for united states tanks ? pretty sure the largest recipient is poland look it up every country which gave away soviet tanks for exchange gets german ones .. the thing is populist government of poland is good in presenting themselves the fact is they took the old american tanks and also demands the newest version of the leopard for exchange ( which they knew is impossible to just deliver , not even the bundeswehr has a full range of them ) so they want both and are also shittalking over germany because they won't deliver the newest tank like next week . ( its impossible , the abrams they got are old versions and they aren't bitching about that ) its just shitting on germany because its good for their politics . the government is one of the biggest problems europe has"
12914,> germany has sent barely more than helmets . not sure if you're just talking shit for the sake of it or if you're actually too far up your own ass to do some research .
12915,"are you just ignorant , or is this some kind of russia-inspired attempt to sow division ? there is enough freely available information on germany's true contribution to disprove your ( russian ?) bullshit claims ."
12916,"you are pretty dumb , germany is one of the pillars that holds the eu together , the eu that made it possible that the baltic states are in the nato , that countries like poland are even in the position to help like they do now ."
12917,i have to believe even russia wouldn't be that stupid ...
12918,"thanks babe , ill put netflix on"
12919,"who exactly he was addressing is a non-issue . what he is saying is true and is applicable to everyone , not just the countries in a given bloc ."
12920,"absolutely no way , many of the u.s.s political and economic relations ( especially with european countries ) relies on the u.s.s military strength . why do you think our military spending is so high ? republicans should recognize this the most out of anyone and any dissent is just for show ."
12921,you're literally not even making any sense . what language are you using ?
12922,says the dude using edgy 4chan insults
12923,"wtf are you even talking about . germany imposed sanctions russia just like any other nations in the eu . and no , it was not clear that the war was already coming ."
12924,what's there to see ? you can open internet and check . just like chinese . translation tools allow you to get the gist of any info . but hey . they throw blatant lies since 2004 . nothing new . maybe even earlier but i was tad young to understand before that . people in russia believe it is ukraine was going to attack russia and entire war is a preemptive measure taken especially after they took massive military formations to border months prior and ukraine did no such thing .
12925,thought they gave up on phrenology
12926,why wouldnt they fix it ? that gas is a huge source of income ik its hurt euro but also hurt russias funding for war
12927,"it is , but suspicion is that russia will be making excuses to turn it back on , to get some concessions from europe . for example , they could say that sanctions are blocking access to some critical parts they need ."
12928,"true , but when in the history of ever has russia not done the most shitheel thing it could do ? in any case the western world has a bundle of reasons to want to expedite a decisive victory in ukraines favor here as well as to cut all economic ties with russia given its actions this year ."
12929,in january - its just planned military excersises like every year . nothing to see here please disperse. 
12930,i edited my comment a few minutes before you posted yours . my response is there
12931,"> short of nuking ukraine , they won't win . war of attrition , look it up . short of the west actually joining the war , i don't see how the russians wont get their objective . they are old style imperialists , unless you stiff arm them , they don't stop . > bulgaria and poland are small potatoes to them , there is hardly any leverage with them . hold the german economy by the b is prolly * the * go to plan of theirs when it comes to holding europe at bay . i am willing to bet a lot of money that they are not stopping the gas , they play with it to keep germans in line . nord stream 1 , if anything was a foundational piece of their imperialistic ... dreams . big part of their plan . > you assume there's logic in russia's actions . expecting our enemies to be stupider and shallow compared to us ... as if that worked in * any * prior war . they said "" the japs are no better than medieval peasants "", then the very same "" japs "" bombed their port unbeknownst to them even having a plan and took them to a 4 year ride in the pacific that needed actual atomic weapons so that to be resolved . * never * underestimate your enemies , they thought all that and more . i honestly hope we have more in store than falling for everything their propaganda allows us to believe . i hope that we do end up a step ahead of them , but that will not happen unless we d entertain the thought that they are planning this for many years , probably a decade or more and it did not come out of nowhere . and to the extend it did ( to us ) it is because we were not paying attention ... never underestimate your enemies ..."
12932,"nice appreciate it im gonna see if i can get that in there . the accounts prolly already deleted or whatever . i noticed they vanish quick or on quora would report me for ' hate speech ' when i would point out their bullshit . even worse ? quora would delete my posts . and i wasnt just using slurs or whatever . quora has become very odd , they seemingly go out of their way to appease open nazis or russo fascists"
12933,and us ships would just run the blockade .
12934,"keeping europe safe is in the us best interests . if it wasn't , they'd have left what was left of it to be swallowed up by the soviet union after wwii ."
12935,"i mean definitely be worried , but its not hopeless . theres enough of us here who havent lost our minds yet , we just gotta get the wheel back from the radicals . wish us luck"
12936,"us sent weapons and trained them after crimea unlike europe who built ns2 for their russian overlords.and it's not only schroeder smart guy ns 2 was built during merkel after fucking crimea . and don't be so sure about this winter , europe increasing it's dependence on a murderous dictatorship and now they'll suffer only because of their actions and no one else's"
12937,"even if there were no grain waiting to be shipped they would still be doing this though ( and they actually occupy most of them ). so it's a bit besides the point . also , there is grain there to be bought - but russia is being sanctioned . to some degree the scarcity is also a choice of the buyer ."
12938,so you wanted to discuss nato and you forgot half of the alliance ?
12939,"mad doesn't just prevent the use of nuclear weapons , it prevents war altogether . name one nuclear nation in the history of the world that has seen it's home soil attacked . there isn't one . because losing ground in a war is the precursor to losing more ground , and more , until you lose control of your nukes . the very * second * a nation's home soil is credibly threatened , those nukes are on the table . which is why they've never even been attacked , let alone lost ground ."
12940,"> wow the poorest answer imaginable , the same amount as a random other country . random country - i picked it because it's the second largest economy in the eu , 2nd largest budget contributor in the eu , in the top 10 of global defence spenders , member of the g7 and a holder of one of the few permanent seats on the un security council - but yeah , just random . > yeah who isnt .. most countries are training ukrainians on specific equipment they are supplying - the uk is training them in terms of training them to act as general infantry , something many countries aren't doing . it's a continuation of a policy where the uk trained 22,000 ukrainian soldiers in since 2014 , the only other countries doing similar being the united states , canada , poland , sweden , lithuania and denmark - the proactive nature of which is likely why ukraine is able to deploy a depth of units all trained to nato standards . > look it up every country which gave away soviet tanks for exchange gets german ones .. i looked it up - the only country receiving german tanks in exchange for sending soviet-era tanks is greece , so exactly one country and no information on numbers has been announced as the word tanks was loosely mentioned alongside other equipment . > the thing is populist government of poland is good in presenting themselves the fact is they took the old american tanks and also demands the newest version of the leopard for exchange ( which they knew is impossible to just deliver , not even the bundeswehr has a full range of them ) germany could have easily provided a better alternative , like the newer tanks when available and in the meantime germany would deploy tanks to poland to ensure that poland didn't lose it's deterrent , it chose not to and as such poland went with american tanks who offered exactly that - along with that they also get british tanks deployed in poland to support polish tanks whilst the american tanks are being readied and delivered . > its just shitting on germany because its good for their politics . the government is one of the biggest problems europe has poland has a pretty shitty government , but it's not like it's not expected or particularly unique in europe or the eu - in fact , i'd argue that despite being a problem in both those senses , they aren't close to being the worst problem europe has . that's mainly because whilst having some poor domestic policies they are also one of the largest supporters of a stronger defence against russia and one of the biggest supporters of importing energy from alternative sources whilst other western european countries have been completely obtuse to this - you can blame poland for some stuff in europe , but the biggest challenge in the past half a century in europe has nothing to do with them at all , in fact they've been actively ignored on their stance despite them being in the right ."
12941,"hey hey , no reason to call people dumb and argue with fellow eu members . that's the narrative russian regime is trying to push now , so the west would stop supplying weapons . russia started loosing the war on the battlefield and ukraine will be taking back it's territory now"
12942,"si vols t'ho comento en catal . com treus la conclusi de "" europa vol a rssia "" d'un missatge a on noms comento que no m'agrada la postura dels estats units ? gr cies per contestar ."
12943,sneed isn't an insult . remember to sneed btw
12944,"now you're just straight up lying about it . germany had to be pressured into following the most effective sanctions , including the swift banking cutoff , by its european peers after it tried to stay on good terms with russia so it could keep buying cheap gas . it's following them now , but as we can see from your posts some germans are also refusing to admit they ever resisted doing so . way to prove the guy's point . and yes , the war was always going to happen . russia wouldn't have it any other way . if you can't even admit that you're so full of shit you're not even worth arguing with . edit : hey germans supporting this guy , downvote all you want , you can't argue with history :"
12945,ukraine attacked donbass for 8 years . ukraine did not implement the minsk 2 agreement . and what about the biolabs in ukraine ? only research facilities ? prior to the war ukraine was described as the most corrupted country in europe by western media .
12946,because it's worth the risk on the off chance germany gives up and tries to remove sanctions . as far as i'm aware it's pretty much the only leverage outside of nukes russia has left .
12947,"> for example , they could say that sanctions are blocking access to some critical parts they need . they already have . a turbine was being repared in canada , but the lead contractor was siemens , a german company . canada refused to release the turbine and putin used that as an excuse to say they couldn't restart ."
12948,"the irony is they absolutely are . similarly , oil and gas is a demanding , but also technical field . the western companies that were supplying parts , labor , and technical expertise have stopped . many businesses run on service contracts . those were canceled months ago . this is an expected part of the sanctions . just the people who put them in place didn't think things through . what has likely happened is the companies are running far leaner than they're supposed to . maybe spares were never ordered and the money pocketed . maybe a part was swapped for a cheaper one . or maybe the books are accurate , and spares were never ordered and the parts are far past their service life . because management refuse to order more . maybe maintenance was deferred too long or stretched in the name of corporate profits . oh , and the pandemic likely didn't help either ."
12949,"a war of attrition works by wearing down the resistance until they run out of people , moral or equipment . ukraine will fight to the last man or woman , and they'd do it with tooth and claw if they ran out of bullets . they won't run out of equipment any time soon , because the international community will gladly give ukraine weapons indefinitely . we didn't underestimate russia , we ( in many cases ) overestimated them . we expected them to roll through ukraine as they * should * have been able to . you talk about the past yet you ignore what's literally just happened . thankfully , russia was incompetent and sustained vast losses and achieved very little . the war in ukraine is a gift to america . russia has regressed itself by over a decade . why would america and its allies stop throwing resources at ukraine ? america gets to buy its own very expensive weapons , which feeds into its own military industrial complex . that's good for politicians . and those weapons are used , with virtually no risk to american military personal , against one of its primary antagonists . it's basically free attacks on america's biggest historical enemy ( ignoring china , a topic for another time .) same with the uk . russia literally botched assassination attempt using chemical weapons in the south of england that ended up killing someone ( not the target(s )). we will happily keep handing over expensive weapons , providing humanitarian aid , and training , because a stronger ukraine means a weaker russia . and the public sentiment in britain is very much "" fuck russia . slava ukraini ."" the reason the full-scale invasion happened was because the us and uk did nothing in 2014 . it emboldened russia , who then overestimated its own competence and underestimated ukraine . the current british ruling political party [ loved russian money ]( our pm boris johnson carried out [ bullshittery bordering treason ]( but those ties have become toxic , so political will swings violently the other way . bojo loves [ pro-ukrainian pr ]( ukraine likes him more than we do . we won't let russia punch us for free again . russia's and ukraine's neighbours have also seen the price of inaction and appeasement . every russian invader killed in ukraine is one that won't be marching through warsaw or riga . every euro and bullet and meal donated to ukraine is one that's spent fighting russia . and ukraine are the only ones paying in blood . for the international community that suddenly finds fighting russia to be extremely urgent , that's a fucking bargain . and in fairness to germany , they rapidly brought the hammer down on the nord stream 2 baltic sea gas pipeline . they've shown they'll take pain themselves in order to hurt russia . ukraine will keep fighting , and are going to continue to receive the best weapons and training we can give ."
12950,"> war of attrition , look it up . can you please be slightly more condescending ? > are small potatoes to them , there is hardly any leverage with them . > hold the german economy by the b is prolly * the * go to plan of theirs when it comes to holding europe at bay . just enough messaging to european countries that they need to gtfo from russian gas dependency and more towards "" green "" hydrogen , wind , solar , tidal , etc if nobody has the will to move to renewables , there's russia to persuade them . it won't be cheap , it won't be fast , it will happen though . > expecting our enemies to be stupider and shallow compared to us ... putin ** used ** to be shrewd operator . past tense . dictators always end up with a bullet in the back of their head and he knows it . no idea what he gains from this , apart from a few more years before he gets replaced . > as if that worked in * any * prior war . they said "" the japs are no better than medieval peasants "", then the very same "" japs "" bombed their port unbeknownst to them even having a plan and took them to a 4 year ride in the pacific that needed actual atomic weapons so that to be resolved . i'm not american , can't comment . see "" groupthink "" in relation to how they didn't see 11th september 2001 . bunch of middle aged white males ( as i am ), same background , same way of thinking , those were the people tasked with stopping something like that . i'd say hubris was very much involved . > never underestimate your enemies ... i don't ... but who cares what i think"
12951,"quora has always valued superficial niceties over the substance , and trolls love to use that ."
12952,"i'm sure , and also i'd look inwards at texas if i'm you , hope they don't die from freezing second winter in a row while texas leadership scratches their balls and get their pockets full . edit , meanwhile uk did nothing while the heroic us armed forces carried everyone on their back since 2014 / s edit , more bitches be salty , because facts don't care about your feelings ."
12953,"do you memorize the % gdp contribution of all 30 members of nato , many of which are barely more populous than some mid-sized cities ? if you want to be pedantic , lets be specific -- the countries i didn't mention are greece , poland , lithuania , estonia , latvia , croatia , slovak republic , and romania . collectively , they contribute about $ 40b usd in their defense budgets . the total contribution of france and uk are $ 130b usd in comparison . my apologies for not mentioning the 8 other countries that * collectively * spend less than what either france or the uk spends alone . come back when you have something useful to contribute ."
12954,that's something you say now after the other poster and his friends where spreading lies to undermine this unity ? especially when the uk isn't in the eu anyway ...
12955,or its cope or whatever i don't give a fuck . its dumb and you do it to try and wind people up . back to your cave troll
12956,"are you drinking or something ? any decent county has bio labs . and they have very strict regulations just like nuclear plants . you sure can look it up or ask people that work in that industry . sure ukraine has corruption issues but it is taking strides to fight it off and join european union where part of laws required to join address corruption . never had any thoughts about why russia started invading when ukraine decided that eu is better compared to russia and made effort to join ? most corrupt ? look up russia . they have half population live in unbelievable conditions . some don't even have access to fridge and other things . look up sochi olympics corruption . or any major event . even this war russia started . look at their equipment , food supply , some even have weapons from 1900 . then talk your shit . but first think about crap you spew out"
12957,"the corruption is correct , you forgot that russia is much worse regarding oligarchy and corruption . ukraine is massivly restricting opposition . the rest of your comment is incromprehensible conspiracy theory . and none of what you wrote justifies an imperialist invasion . in a war between imperialist , bourgeois nations , it is the working class and the poor that are sent to die ."
12958,most transparent stooge be like
12959,that's a whole pile of propaganda points . you accuse the west of . you're drinking it in too . did you forget the little green men in crimea and donbass that started it ? biolabs -> fuck off with your dumb shit . i have a biolab at work . yep . ukraine's got some brutal corruption issues . so does every government . that's what governments do .
12960,outside of nukes is a hell of an operative phrase lol
12961,"the sanctions part is a far point , but i cant see germany releasing sanctions for the gas but well see when or if it happens , releasing sanctions imo is siding with them , only time will tell"
12962,"which is why i said that the west should officially enter the war if the care to win it . ukraine is too small , to put up with half a continent worth of resources . you say the west would keep supplying with resources , sure , not with boots on the ground though . for better or worse ukrainian casualties are more irreplaceable than russian casualties . only reason the war lasts longer * is * because the west is supplying the ukrainians , however they cannot and do not supply them with men . a war of attrition lasts for years , not ( for ) a few months . once the ukrainian numbers start going down who is going to replace them ? especially the veterans ? are you and your compatriots goings to fight there ? a russian , any russian in warsaw and riga is also total world annihilation , it can't be . no matter how many of them are they they can't set foot in nato soil in the nuclear age . i can't see russians losing a war of attrition because it's almost never the case for the small guy to win over the larger guy , not for long . the war will possibly end with ukraine paying war damages to russia ( measured land and physical wealth as well as a finland like relationship ) ... * unless * you see ( western ) boots on the ground . uktrimately war is not won purely by weapons ( even mad is not a win , it's annihilation for both sides ) but by men and women on the field . 2022 did not happen because we were lax in 2014 , that's the wrong way to see it . it happened because , in fact , we went all the way to the other side . especially continental europe . increased gas and russian oil dependence , the german industry had pipelines directly to them . sanctions almost never work if you do not have the rest of the world follow ( and they did not ), not being in need of their resources is what works . 2014 should have signaled a total and complete change of pace * against * the use of russian energy . btw something similar should happen with chinese industry , that's an even worse ticking bomb . they are clearly playing with their industrial capacities and capacity to create inflation to the rest of the world ( them and the russians combined in fact )..."
12963,"it's not that's you did not memorise the gdp it's the fact that you made a comment about nato , i'm which you act like no one is paying the 2 % beside the uk and france and the us . when it is evident you have never looked into it yourself . at least now you seem to have actually done some research instead of parroting reddit talking points with no research"
12964,is it really trying if it got you this worked up tho lmao
12965,> i don't give a fuck ( x )
12966,"oh i forgot , ukraine didn't implement the minsk 2 agreement because that is a conspiracy theory to "
12967,ok so that victoria nuland testified in march that the biolabs in ukraine are only research facilities is a conspiracy theory ? and donbass haven't been attacked and shelled by ukraine since 2014 ? well i guess i am a conspiracy theorist then 
12968,"it is and it isn't , because nukes are actually pretty terrible as leverage , their great for stopping other people from nuking you but aside from that there's not a lot you can do with them . use one on a non nuclear power and you become a pariah state . now everyone knows you are willing to use one and is desperately trying to come up with ways to wipe you off the map before you kill us all and wont trade with you for breaking the nuclear taboo . use one against a nuclear power or its allies ? congratulations ! your county is now made out of glass . there's only so far threatening to push the bug red button will get you as in the back of everyone's mind everybody knows you aren't actually stupid enough to do it . the gas is a far more effective leverage than the nukes are because you can actually turn it off and everybody knows it ."
12969,yup i now understand why living in interesting times isn't as much fun as it sounds .
12970,"the thing is , most people like living and having their family live . even in russia . so , nukes are highly unlikely . even a tactical nuclear weapon used on an empty ukrainian field would result in sanctions that make north korea and iran look open ."

12972,"so i'm in poland , in one of the main cities , and lately we've been hearing more jets flying over , going east . thing is , usually when we hear jets , we see their transponders on sites like flightradar24.com , but lately ? there's nothing on these websites . we do have a military base nearby ( like many cities here ), but again , you can usually see these on the flight tracking websites when they are just burning fuel during the summer , so they can keep the same budget for next year . edit : been informed that pilots require a number of hours of flight time , which can also explain why during the summer there's more jet activity . again though , usually these appear on flight tracking websites ( flightrader shows it as a jet icon for example ). basically , just a lot more activity than usual happening , flying quite high up and very fast ( they are super loud for something so high up - going supersonic perhaps ?)"
12973,this is the definition of a low key warning of abrupt consequences .
12974,"nato is a defensive organization to contain russia , now that russia is being aggressive invading countries it's time to get into defensive mode , we're not friends anymore , we don't actually like you and we're going to put a whole bunch of soldiers on the border so that if you come in we are going to kick you in the balls repeatedly , that's perfectly logical and pretty much what nato's for ."
12975,streisand effect : we are invading ukraine because were worried they may want to join nato and we cant have any more nato on our doorstep . sweden and finland apply to join nato . nato itself now says all agreements with russia are now null . putin : wtf ??
12976,this should have happened with crimea .
12977,"putin facilitated what he claims to be his worst security concern , which is the strengthening and expansion of nato against russia . i don't know if he is delusional or arrogant , but he is probably both . pulling a full-scale invasion and expects an easy win with very little consequences sounds like madness to any rational person , but i guess dictators have a different mentality than most people , and being surrounded by yes-men might encourage certain irrational behaviors . russia has been a geopolitical rival to nato , but there existed a certain level of compromises and agreements between the two , now putin has disrupted the balance , he is responsible for the consequences ."
12978,we can pretty much know that there's half a dozen american nuclear submarines in the waters around russia already .
12979,the putin effect
12980,didn't russia also violate the agreement not to invade ukraine if they gave up their nuclear weapons ?
12981,no country on earth must be bound by any treaties or guarantees from russia . they are entirely worthless .
12982,what was the impetus for the original agreement ?
12983,man i don't think this invasion could have possibly backfired any worse for putin .
12984,polands about to become the biggest military power on the planet
12985,to think there was a time during the 1990s when some questioned whether nato was necessary and called nato a relic of the cold war without a real purpose . there was also scattered talk of having russia join nato . [ at one point putin may have wanted to join nato . [
12986,you are only as committed to words written on paper as you chose to be ..
12987,i mean i get it's all about formalities but this should have been said the very first day russia invaded ukraine .
12988,"this assumes their nuclear arms have a better success rate than their other weapons . what better place for corruption to flourish than weapon systems that are "" last resort "". maybe the russians have taken a nuclear response off the table realizing they will be smoked in one , perhaps in large part by their own weapons ."
12989,"everybody hates putin . no matter who wins or loses , russia has lost all credibility with the world , and will continue to lose credibility , as long as putin is in charge . and the only people who can get rid of him are the russians ."
12990,good news for the defence contractors in us . they already spend $ 800 billion on defence .
12991,no better defense than a good offense

12993,star wars strategy . spend them into oblivion
12994,time to put russia in their place ! fuck putin
12995,"and to think , putin really really didn't want nato presence on his borders , all he had to do was not do what he's currently doing . if he kept within his borders , nato may have requested russia to be allies , but he couldn't do something that smart could he ."
12996,russia has proven to be bad faith actors . dont trust liars to honor their agreements . it makes sense .
12997,"as a hungarian , please save us from the current government , cba what it takes"
12998,really hope to see more nato presence in the baltics !
12999,i kinda thought so . back in 2014 .
13000,good . nato should put as much pressure on russia's eastern flank as possible and cause the russians lots of paranoia since the russians love causing fear with its neighbors . time to make russia feel uncomfortable too .
13001,"i don't understand where this says anything of meaning . nato could have increased its troops and defenses along member borders at any time . this is not saying that nato is going to do anything outside of it's borders . they are just making a statement that they will protect themselves , but that doesnt include ukraine ."
13002,looks like were going to be needing all those a-10s after all .
13003,this is illegal! - putin
13004,"putin : reverts back to imperialism and invades ukraine . nato : gets alarmed , helps ukraine , starts setting up strong defenses on border . putin : surprised pikachu face . "" whaaaaat ?!? why are you accumulating military forces near the border we're so peaceful and morally outraged !"" stomps wrinkled old feet . "" stop opposing our genocidal soldiers and sending ukrainian civilians into camps , you're nazis just like them !"""
13005,why was nato ever bound by commitments to russia ? the point of nato was and is to counteract any hostile actions perpetrated by russia .
13006,"gee you think took a while for them to realize it , while russia is threatening to invade all the east european countries and not happy with sweden and finland joining"
13007,the military industrial complex smiles as it strokes it's throbbing erection while ransacking the wallets of taxpayers .
13008,about damn time !
13009,"god help us , hopefully putin kicks the bucket and we can get someone with reason ."
13010,kick turkey out
13011,"reminder we didn't do this earlier because nato has never been a threat to russia . they literally have nukes , the only possible war between russia and nato is nuclear and yet we made every effort to appease russia except ignore the please of countries begging to be members of the defensive alliance ."
13012,as if nato was ever bound by any commitment to russia
13013,f35s go brrrrrr
13014,"russia was given the chance to join the prosperity of the west , too bad they decided to become whatever the fuck they are no , a shame really ."

13018,i just wish putin would make a nuclear mistake so the world will collectively turn all of russia into glass and be done with his retardation
13019,and putin takes another shot to his nuts . must be jelly by now after so many blows .
13020,ah yes .. the beginning of the end .
13021,"interesting , ive never seen a last name spelled with a question mark before . the names bond ? james bond? "
13022,great . when ukraine can join ?
13023,good . we need more troops and equipment closer to this idiot so we can put him in the ground . this war is going to end one way and that bwith putin in a coffin .
13024,ouff . i guess europe is now done with stroking putins ego . good .
13025,"we have enough to deter any attack on our allies , and given putin's lack of success in ukraine , he'd have to be a complete idiot to try anything against our allies now . we can posture and then use it as a bargaining chip to try to end the war . i am guessing that is the play here . but putin will see that as well . it doesn't change the calculus of his strategy at all because it is operationally not going to change any of his options or their feasible consequences going forward ."
13026,kremlin forgot to carry the one on their math
13027,how about they get greece's borders beefed up with erdogan being a total tool ?
13028,major troop increase coinciding with war games in the baltic sea and economies collapsing ... looks like nato's going to war .
13029,thems fightn words .
13030,lets put millions of troops on the border .
13031,"wait . thats illegal . - russia , probably"
13032,like nato ever was 
13033,holy shit i m.getting uneasy reading the comm section
13034,lets go europe lets go
13035,"sounds low key on its face , but i wonder how much panic and fuss this will cause chez kremlin ."
13036,geoa .... gary ?
13037,"same in the uk . i live near 3 raf bases and recently there has been a huge increase in military jets flying overhead . i think europe as a whole are making sure everything's in full working order , just in case ."
13038,"most of the nato jets flying over poland since the crisis began have never been visible on fr . some of the bigger ones have - tankers , awacs , cargo , and recon planes are visible regularly , but there have only been a handful of fighters ever seen , which by nato's own admission is just a fraction of what's in the air ."
13039,"> they are just burning fuel during the summer , so they can keep the same budget for next year . afaik pilots need minimum number of flight hours to keep current status . if you don't fly you'll be grounded and is no good for anyone ."
13040,some military aircraft can be seen at if they arent visible on fr24 .
13041,"i've never seen fighter jets on flight radar , even when they were performing at air shows and such . i think they just use different frequencies ."
13042,feel like weve had low key warnings for a while now .. this is less of a warning and more of a confirmation .
13043,i'm surprised eu still is offering visas ( i know czechs and lithuania have already greatly reduced them ). i think in the years to come russians will just be locked out of europe . but perhaps they want the brain drain to continue .
13044,so basically cold war pt2 . should make for some good tv at least this time
13045,and here some thought nato was no longer useful .
13046,they were never friends in the first place .
13047,imagine being that much brain washed to still think that nato is defensive organization 
13048,that's a great mentality to have if your desired outcome is a large war
13049,"nato has not been a defensive organisation since the bombing of iraq , libya and serbia . nato is a branch of the us military , and all the countries in nato are the us pawns . if nato ever has a conflict with russia , you and i will be writing these messages on a piece of a stone after that , downvoting morons ."
13050,the wording of this comment almost gave me a seizure .
13051,"also , we are going into ukraine to defend russian speakers , now we will rape , murder and deport all the russian speaking people in ukraine . as a side effect of this , russian speakers in ukraine will decide to start speaking ukrainian . we will win ! source , my girlfriend is from kharkiv , native russian speaker , won't speak russian anymore ."
13052,its not the streisand effect . its the fact that russia unlawfully invaded another country without any real pretense other than because we want it . nato made these agreements and finland stayed neutral on the condition that russia wont do that .
13053,putin doesn't care about that . he just wanted more land and to show that he could commit atrocities like a big strong macho man with a small penis .
13054,"how about we just admin ukraine into nato right now as an junior member ? and then tell russia to get the hell out of ukraine ? ( junior member or apprentice member or some such term , since they are technically different at present , and would not yet formally qualify )"
13055,it was never really about nato or they'd have made an agreement with ukraine in 2014 to give back donbass and crimea for guarantees about not joining nato and black sea access . ukraine wasn't really in a position to refuse back then . putin wanted to remake the russian empire .
13056,"very true , but better late than never ."
13057,"and it would have , if the ukraine of today existed in 2014 . but the ukraine of 2014 was more like the ana than the ukraine of today . it would have been impossible for nato to help ukraine fight off russia without sending in actual nato troops , and that would have been far too risky in terms of triggering a nuclear exchange . the lesson is that nato aid is a force multiplier ; but 10 x 0 is still 0 . the recipient needs to have some capacity to fight back on their own for nato aid to multiply it , otherwise it just ends up looking like afghanistan did ."
13058,ukraine's military wasn't in a position to be supplied with foreign aid then . it was pretty pathetic .
13059,i mean ... efp was deployed in the baltics and poland because of crimea and we just rotated troops for those so they weren't permanent technically . same with baltic air policing which we've been doing since 2004 and is totally not a permanent deployment . i don't think this will actually change a whole lot . poland will probably get its us base which they've wanted for a while and that's it .
13060,nato should have retaliated after it was discovered that russia was behind the radioactive poisoning in the uk . what isn't much reported is that the incident irradiated a square block .
13061,this should have happened with georgia
13062,as an outsider . putin had things looking much muddier during crimea . it was confusing to figure what was true with that scenario with all the talk about ethnic russians being the abused and puppet government officials . this invasion was more clear cut to understand . i'm glad they were able to predict what was going to happen just before each step of the way .
13063,"putin needs that to convince the russian population that nato is after taking russia ... which yes , is absolute bullshit ."
13064,i cant hear the term curb stomped without thinking of american history x .
13065,"plot twist : putin is just a deep-cover western agent placed decades ago , to gain control of as much of the russian state machine as possible . his goal : to manipulate russia into a state where they screw the pooch so badly that they essentially nullify any concessions they had from nato regarding country membership or military force buildup . and eventually russia loses most of its economic grip on europe and the west , and the majority of its political clout a la north korea . _tinfoil level 9000++_"
13066,its what he knew would happen regardless
13067,"which was all very foreseeable and predictable and why i didn't think putin would invade especially when he did . the well was poisoned , discourse was alienating people towards nato , invading would only give proof nato did need to exist , by just waiting nato would have weakened itself not . if he did want to invade it made so much more sense to wait until after the midterms when very likely a republican takeover occurs in congress . when bidens ability to have a united front would have been . severely curtailed and european allies would have had far less confidence in his ability to deliver on promises . invading when putin did and invading at all was a predictability terrible idea even when considering putin's own metrics . which does illuminate what kind of people . putin . surrounds himself with at this point and . what kind of advice and criticism he allows himself to hear ."
13068,"if they had captured the kyiv airport chances are much greater that kyiv would have fell . their whole war hinged on a battle they lost early . instead they couldn't secure the ability to reprovision the front lines around kyiv and had to instead rely on the overstretched land supply lines . without a blitz on kyiv russia's invasion floundered , especially with the logistical failures on the ground . the idea was probably less absurd than it now seems in hind sight , but again it all hinged on winning a fight , and they lost it"
13069,"personally , i think he knew this was going to happen and wants to egg on a war with nato . why ? that's the psychotic part ."
13070,question : did he think it would be easy because of crimea ?
13071,"each ohio class nuclear submarine carries 24 nuclear missiles with ranges in excess of 7500 miles . each missile has up to 12x 475 kiloton nuclear reentry vehicles , each capable of independently targeting with an accuracy of within 90 meters . assuming we have just 4 of the 14 ohio class subs within 7500 miles of their russian targets , thats 1,152 targets being hit with bombs 30 times more powerful than those that fell in ww2 ."
13072,his brains are not decorating any objects yet so there is still room to get worse for him .
13073,i would have just resigned if that was me like its embarrassing
13074,- finland and sweden joining nato . - germany putting billions into their army . - japan building their military up again . - nato about to swarm the russian border . all in less than half a year .
13075,> to think there was a time during the 1990s when some questioned whether nato was necessary and called nato a relic of the cold war without a real purpose . yeah that was actually just three years ago .
13076,"i think most people sincerely hoped , and it was a sincere effort to help russia transition . then the russian government decided to go full authoritarian kleptocracy in stages , and "" the west "" was a useful scapegoat as the russian government and oligarchs robbed the country . i still hope they'll sort themselves out ."
13077,to think there was a time three years ago when an american president was spouting the same nonsense .
13078,"if russia joined nato , i suspect that they'd just use their position to paralyse the entire organisation and eventually have it fall apart ."
13079,"as fallible as their equipment has been , and with much of nato supplying weapons and training to ukraine , russia has undeniably succeeded in hurting ukraine badly . i'm not sure i want to see even that level of success from their nuclear arsenal ."
13080,he's lost all credibility in the western world .
13081,"id say that , in this case , its actually justified . if us didnt have that kind of budget , russia would probably steamroll ukraine and moldova , poland etc . next ."
13082,which would have been an economic powerhouse if putin and his cronies hadn't stolen everything .
13083,"> all he had to do was not do what he's currently doing . up until he swiped crimea , ukrainians in favor joining nato had polling numbers of about 20 % or lower . i.e ., putin already had the perfect buffer state . even after yanukovych was tossed out , the subsequent [ yatsenyuk government ]( was against joining nato . that all changed once he swiped crimea and set up those statelets . big surprise . that's worth noting the next time some maearshimer-wannabe tries to make it seem like nato's insatiable lust for expansion or victoria nuland and the us state dept . were what "" pushed "" ukraine into nato ."
13084,putin has royally screwed up .
13085,"i hope that finally a permanent us military base can be established in my country . russia has always been a lying , sadistic and imperialistic country with a inferiority complex towards others . the only thing they respect is strength and sheer commitment ."
13086,"i think that that is what this proclamation was about , fortifying frontline states in a way they couldnt before because of agreements with russia ."
13087,"there are nato battlegroups in lithuania , latvia , and estonia . they will be getting bigger ."
13088,"nato is there . a larger presance means we're closer to war . if anything , i'd prefer the "" we're barely there "" presence of before ."
13089,"> i don't understand where this says anything of meaning . nato has previously refrained from stationing alliance troops in the former warsaw pact/ussr countries . the only troops in estonia were estonian . after 2014 it started having fairly small numbers of troops in the baltics on a rotating basis , so there but not permanent . the announcement is saying that will no longer be the case and nato will consider permanent basing of troops in the eastern member states . the could potentially mean something like the us bases in germany being built in estonia or poland . this is a very significant change in nato force policy ."
13090,"it helps ukraine indirectly though , because now moscow will probably see it as a necessity to put more troops and equipment on their western borders than before . that will siphon resources that could otherwise have gone towards the ukraine war if nato didn't change posture ."
13091,what would you like them to do ? just because we don't consider a treaty valid does not mean we're going to invade .
13092,"ideally - but the us probably wont send them , until after nato countries get attacked ."
13093,gonna be hard for him to stomp those feet when he can barely keep them still while sitting 
13094,bruh
13095,"on nov . 4 , 2021 george robertson , a former uk labour defence secretary who led nato between 1999 and 2003 , told the guardian that putin made it clear at their first meeting that he wanted russia to be part of western europe . putin said : when are you going to invite us to join nato?...they wanted to be part of that secure , stable prosperous west that russia was out of at the time, he said . the account agrees with what putin said in an interview with david frost in a bbc interview just before putin was inaugurated as president of russia for the first time in 2000 . he told frost it was hard for him to visualize nato as an enemy . russia is part of the european culture . and i cannot imagine my own country in isolation from europe and what we often call the civilized world. a chance to dream and get fucked to become salty and seek revenge , i suppose ."
13096,nato won't de-escalate until putin is fatally wounded
13097,putin is backing himself deeper into a dangerous hole . what do you suggest ? putin will take advantage of weakness .
13098,considering those whole thing is ~~ ostentatiously ~~ ostensibly about building a buffer between russia and nato he's probably got a lot on his mind about this .
13099,"it's worth noting that with the bulk of their army deployed in offensive operations and tied down , they're more vulnerable than they've been in decades . this might be a ploy to pressure them to back off a little . but can they count on that ? should they ?"
13100,"considering that pootins spezial operation was supposed to secure the eastern flank its has the opposite effect with finland and sweden joining nato , plus factor in a trashed military and economy then pretty much the whole federation is screwed ."
13101,"unless they have a better threat than nukes , they dont really have much to say extra , they have already exhausted and repeated the same crap for 3 months . yesterday the russia media was warning us about a tactical military intervention , maybe they want to cross poland with some good old t62's"
13102,"for every 10k soldiers put on russia's borders , that's xk fewer soldiers they can use in ukraine . by nato throwing more and more at the borders , it forces russia to either divert much needed supplies from the war in ukraine , or passively acknowledge that nato isn't the russia-ending threat it's boasted for the last several decades . the more soldiers giving dirty looks and exchanging insults with nato in the west , the less manure for ukraine to make in the south ."
13103,"you're assuming pootini is being told everything at this point . we know he's a technophobe and hates computers and the internet . he's technologically illiterate when it comes to those platforms . he actively shuns using them . so that means he has to get his news from international satellite feeds , newspapers , his spies , and whatever else is left . he's surrounded himself with people who are afraid to tell him the truth out of fear of being thrown into the gulag in siberia . i doubt he even hears about this until he * must * be told ."
13104,hmmm . . . . tables seem to have turned . poutine is now on the receiving end of something like what he is doing to ukraine . two major differences - russian citizens would not be as patriotic as ukrainians ; russians do not have a ' friend ' ( nato ) who would assist them .
13105,intelligence wise it's a huge pia for the fsb and military intelligence to sort through what has changed and what has stayed the same on the front .
13106,pronounciation : djwa-nuh
13107,"that's good . last time europe was caught unawares , world war ii happened , at least now , everyone is ready - which actually decreases the chances ."
13108,"mate , something will happen . you can't hold the world hostage with food and expect no response ."
13109,"there is the troop movements nato , ( and specfically ) the usa announce , then there is the troop movements that happen . i am not trying to toot our horn , but america still has the largest military force on the planet by far . i'm allowed to gloat because my tax dollars pay for it ."
13110,the transponders being on for the tankers and awacs etc is two things at once . 1 by making them visible to all the world if one were to be shot down by the russians they couldn't claim ignorance of what they were firing on . 2 it's in an your face display of power . russia's version of that is violating the airspace or defensive perimeter of other nations . having a fighter or two show up is part of the same play . it's an announcement that if russian aircraft fire they will be fired upon . what's interesting to me is how very clearly different the displays of force are . russia provokes to see what they can get away with and they think that projects power . nato is and has been making a purely defensive one . albeit with a very serious threat of a counter strike if russia were to engage any nato nation's forces .
13111,we're probably flying more jets in a daily show of force than russia is even flying daily sorties in their actual war
13112,"which means that now , as we speak , they are forming - if one doesn't exist already - an airbridge to ukraine . tel aviv style ."
13113,"and the training is very useful . russia has/had a ton of good fighters that could have been doing combined arms coordinated ground strikes and air superiority , but their pilots were never trained for that i guess because the budget for training was siphoned off to megayachts and mansions ."
13114,pilots have hours to maintain rating but the increase in activity is readiness training in the event of a response being required .
13115,nato piolts require a minimum of 200 hours of flight time per year to keep their wings . the guys who take out anti air require an additional 200 hours of flight time specific to that mission . and this usually doesnt inculde the joint operations training stuff they do every year like red flag .
13116,"they show up if they choose to , even have their own little fighter jet icon . you see them every now and then ."
13117,every once in a while i'll see an raf typhoon show up over eastern europe . it's not common but they are occasionally there .
13118,"brain drain , yes . spies , yes ."
13119,i hope they are checking the people asking for visas . anyone with a z on social media should be perma banned from all nato countries .
13120,"why is this surprising ? i feel for the people trapped in russia who have never supported the putin government . there's plenty of normal people there who aren't and don't want to support putin's stupid flexing . plus , getting skilled people out of russia means one less valuable person for russia and one more for us . spies are a concern , i agree , but i feel like the solution to that is to simply not hire those folks for sensitive roles . i would have thought they'd already do something like that . not sure why spies would be more of a concern now as opposed to , say , a year ago . and with that said , the direction of alt right politicians in various countries makes me think that the spies we should be concerned with are actually our own citizens . there is perhaps something to be said about the ability to put pressure on russia's citizens so that they'll do something about putin themselves . but it's not like we were ever gonna allow in so many immigrants that there wouldn't be enough to protest or rebel or whatever ."
13121,why would you want to trap people in russia where their only options are support putin or be persecuted/arrested . better to depopulate/brain-drain the country and leave it weaker than before . much more humane than most other options .
13122,"russian people trying to escape russia should be supported . otherwise , they will be persecuted and discriminated against in russia . if they were supported and welcomed , 1/4 of russia would leave tomorrow ( many are leaving anyway ). there are lots of families with children , educated young people trying to escape . their mentality is european . they have no place in contemporary russia , and western countries would gain brains and children ( considering ageing western population )."
13123,"i don't see the cons outweighing the pros . educated , skilled people ( those who successfully get visas ) are valuable . draining them from russia to the west is in our advantage . we also get a propaganda win and a greater flow of western ideas/culture into russia ."
13124,"i'm sad that it's a popular opinion in this subreddit . there are bad people everywhere , you shouldn't judge anyone by the place they were born in . you can easily sort out those who support the war and decline them visas ."
13125,"not really . russia is very weak . ussr wasn't . cold war was basically an arms race . following this analogy , nato has already reached the finish line , and russia is stuck in traffic jam , trying to get to the stadium ."
13126,"russia got a good 30 years to decide if it wanted to play nice , follow international law , and join the global economy . they made a calculated choice not to ."
13127,"honestly , i prefer russian communist general stereotype as the default bad guys in american movies to middle eastern terrorist stereotype so it will be a nice return to form ."
13128,"cold war is over , russia lost a long time ago . all that remains is their delusions of grandeur ."
13129,russia will collapse faster than the soviet union . the world has had enough of putas bullshit and anyone who supports him . be nice to have social media not flooded with devisive trolls 24/7 once his regime is gone . still got the pink army and various political groups though .
13130,there was a 15ish year span where it seemed like a valid question . i'm not going to fault people for not being able to see into the future .
13131,"ah yes , i remember when the ["" very stable genius ""]( questioned natos relevance . thank the heavens he got the boot ."
13132,"true , it feels really disgusting to speak russian right now source : am ukrainian in ukraine . all my friends share the sentiment . it's not logical , just feeling"
13133,not to mention now people around the world also dislike russian 
13134,"i know a woman from donbas ( she's safe in poland now ), and she said that the day of russian attack everyone started speaking ukrainian exclusively"
13135,"im hard-pressed to disagree with you . outwardly , putin complained about nato being on his doorstep , then later on he was going in to de-nazify ukraine . his excuses and explanations change from day to day . because we want it seems the most likely real reason . but if he truly ** was ** worried about nato-on-my-doorstep then the results would certainly constitute the streisand effect . but youre right : the premise is in doubt ."
13136,"as long as the nuclear war hasnt started yet , i always applaud a correction rather than dig into the past mistakes ."
13137,regardless when russia did this they essentially tore up the budapest memorandum
13138,that thing about 10 x 0 still being 0 is a great way to explain what happened in afghanistan
13139,"and the us and friends have spent the time since 2014 building it up into a force capable of modern proxy war . so in a way , this * did * happen with crimea . it just took time ."
13140,"with the recent revolution , i think leadership was also in doubt . my guess is that even if they had the manpower and training , western powers weren't sure whether advanced military equipment would even stay in the country instead of just getting shipped to russia by their cronies ."
13141,comparing the crimea situation today to crimea of 2014 is like comparing apples and oranges .
13142,it doesn't matter . russia doesn't have the economy to do anything other than bribe foreign politicians .
13143,"well maybe russia doesn't need to be one giant country anymore , since they can't get their shit together ."
13144,almost as if thats the reference or something .
13145,europe was slowly but surely fracturing w brexit & the like . if they had played the long game . instead they are isolated and nato's firing up war strategies . dont forget that i daresay putins fantasies all along were to go to war before he was too old to be at thee helm and enjoy it .
13146,"i think he expected it to go like it did in georgia ... walk in easily take territory , it worked before why not follow the same playbook ... i suspect they underestimated ukraine's defensive capabilities and determination to be free ."
13147,"the reports of him having cancer are probably propaganda but if it's true it makes a lot of sense . if he's been given a deadline that's 20 years earlier than expected , he won't wait for the long burn of the collapse of ukraine - especially since zelensky got power over the russian puppet dude ( whatever his name was ). instead , he'd want to take a faster , if more obvious and more dangerous , approach because ... what does he have to lose ? might as well take territory for russia , if it works he becomes way more powerful if not he dies anyways"
13148,"nobody knows , but "" he didn't expect pushback because he never got it before "" is a popular theory ."
13149,there you go . someone who knows much more than i do .
13150,a reminder that 7500 miles is substantially more than the distance from the continental us to central russia . those submarines can hit their targets from their home ports . they only go to sea to be difficult to find .
13151,"probably fewer targets than warheads , since several detonations around a target are more effective than a single one in the center . still doesn't change the fact that the only question left afterwards would be what color glass the moscow fields would be when nato forces moved in to inspect ."
13152,feel bad for the kids who will study this time period in future history class
13153,youd think thats at least 20 years worth of history but no
13154,and it was the fucking president of the united states who said it .
13155,"> i still hope they'll sort themselves out . i don't think they will . not in our lifetimes . this is a nation has never really known freedom or democracy , just hundreds of years of one authoritarian regime after the next . it'll require generations to unfuck , and that's even assuming any hypothetical * actually * democratic government can even form and , if it does , survive that long in russia ."
13156,"> i still hope they'll sort themselves out . russian history says "" no ."""
13157,"right after trump took office , i was on a road trip out to see family . i was horrified by some kerfuffle trump created by running his mouth in an inappropriate fashion on the world stage . i had no idea at the time , that that would occur on a weekly basis for four straight years ."
13158,or faking death by cancer
13159,> poland russia wouldn't stand a chance against nato even if usa wasn't included .
13160,"> if us didnt have that kind of budget let's be honest ... if the us didn't have that kind of budget , all sorts of conflicts would break out globally . the current us hegemony was tailor made to dominate the entire globe in such a way as to ensure a ww3 never happens . after the first * two * world wars , it was firmly decided in a cold room somewhere filled with men whom have zero sense of humor , that the world needed a parental figure to keep the children in line . this is all the result of that . working . as . intended ."
13161,the weapons and tech we give russia are 20 years old ; much is from uk and germany too . we are not giving them any of the things that our bloated post-9/11 era military used all that extra money for .
13162,they can't even steamroll ukraine how would they roll poland who has both the eu and nato assurances and a vastly easier to defend border .
13163,"hahah i actually live in the netherlands , left a couple years ago to do masters and kinda settling down now"
13164,"would want the same , but logistically think one in latvia makes the most sense ."
13165,why would russia do that ? nato has made it clear again and again they will not cross their own borders . russia knows they don't need to defend their borders .
13166,"* ostensibly ostentatiously means "" while making a display of wealth "", which is the last thing russia is doing right now"
13167,the feathers are ever so slightly ruffled .
13168,it might just worry him to death .
13169,and he's the total absolute reason why this is happening . sweet sweet sweeeeet karma
13170,blah blah * nuke * blah blah * eu * blah blah * sink uk * blah blah * we are the victims !*
13171,this is still a delightful typo . a happy mistake if we are channeling the late great bob ross .
13172,ossetiasly ? crimealy ?
13173,"i think this is to give the west more negotiating chips to get russia out of ukraine . by saying this agreement is no longer binding on nato , they can put , or threaten to put , more military capability next to russia , then offer to pull back that capability in exchange for russia pulling out of ukraine . another interesting thing that should be scaring russia is that its failures in ukraine have shown a big spotlight on their military weaknesses . nato could shore up their eastern defenses with things like more anti-tank weapons and drones for a relatively little amount of effort and money that would would take a disproportionate amount of russian resources to counter . in short , nato could break the bank of the russian military . that could be why the nato deputy secretary general singled out improving the quality of defenses instead of just quantity . ukraine has given nato a blueprint on exactly how to best put a hurting on the russian military ."
13174,"wouldn't it be the western flank , since were looking at it from russia point of view ?"
13175,"im not taking about public statements . agree with you there , they jumped their own shark on that within the first week . was more thinking of internal closed-room tizzies ."
13176,well they do have the only other level 4 bio research lab on the planet ...
13177,russia needs to be worrying about their border with china . if china decided they wanted some of eastern russia the world would stand back and watch . other than nukes russia wouldn't be able to defend themselves .
13178,i need a pronunciation guide for the pronunciation .
13179,clicking the speaker for the romanian side gives a good reading .
13180,"yeah , i do wanna ."
13181,"everyone was ready for world war i , and it still was absolutely horrible and devastating ."
13182,"> now , everyone is ready lol , fuck no . have you seen the state of the dutch and german military ? we can barely send any help to ukraine because we barely have anything to give away ."
13183,the bigger jets also operate at the same altitudes as civilian airliners so they turn them on to provide detect and avoid .
13184,russia likes to fuck around like a 5 year old seeing what his mom will let him get away with . nato likes to act like the mom who will beat that damn kid with a ruler if he doesn't stop acting up . its kinda sad really .
13185,more importantly big awacs and transport planes have no stealth capability so there's really no point in trying to hide them . they're already on russian radar anyway .
13186,should have ended with opposing forces . a half-life opportunity .
13187,"it's pretty much all surveillance i think . there were a couple of news stories that came out with major media reporters flying on the awacs and most of it boiled down to , "" we can see everything you're doing so don't even try ."""
13188,"if they're in controlled airspace they have to have a transponder on . the only exceptions are when they're operating within a restricted moa ( military operating area ) or training routes that are published as active by notam , closed specifically for military maneuvers . while it might not be on the internet site , the radar controller has them on their scope , providing radar services until they enter the area and after they exit . even aircraft on certifiable intercepts will have a transponder code up to a certain point and are identified with special notes in the flight plan that atc can see ."
13189,"i saw one in poland , i think , earlier today ."
13190,"brain drain far more valuable than anything spies can report . "" yes , they're building permanent bases in poland . yes , they hate our guts . yes , they just gave the ukrainians sharks with frickin ' laser beams to fight the black sea fleet ; they televised it live on cnn ."""
13191,> anyone with a z on social media a what now ?
13192,"a lot of russian emigrants in poland support their government and claim the european media are doing propaganda . i'm talking about people that were here before war started . i don't want them to feel welcomed . they've shown by their actions their mentality is far from european . both those who continue to support their government , but also their shameful soldiers that rape , murder and steal everything they can and without hesitation tell their wives over the phone when kind of gifts they can expect when they're back"
13193,"> their mentality is european . absolutely not . loads of russians who live in baltic states refuse to learn and speak local languages to this day , or integrate in any meaningful way ."
13194,also russia's fuel tank is empty because someone sold all the spare diesel on the black market .
13195,"> nato has already reached the finish line nato is reaching the finnish line , too ."
13196,"> ussr wasn't don't forget afghanistan . they lost about as many men in that conflict as russia has so far in ukraine , and it similarly was quite a disaster ."
13197,"nato countries also have a combined gdp of $ 44 trillion . maybe add another $ 800 billion for sweden and finland , and then consider japan is basically nato aligned with active territory disputes with russia and a $ 5 trillion economy . russia is a $ 1.7 trillion economy . even if say you discounted the massive military advantage nato already has technologically and in past spending , you can't have an arms race with someone you have the power to outspend more than 25 to 1 ."
13198,"to be fair they are a criminal dictatorship . like -- quite literally -- the current government came about through organized crime . it's not hyperbole , [ it's history .]( they came to power through illegal activity , made their money through seizing businesses and extortion ( amongst other things ), there's never been a reason to assume they'd stop commiting crimes ."
13199,"russia looked at north korea and thought "" you know what ? i want that too !"". poverty , corruption , indoctrination , and if any other country doesn't do what you want you threaten to nuke them ."
13200,"the choice they made was calculated , but fuck they are bad at math ."
13201,"i know this is a light hearted joke , but damn . it really shows how those of us in the western world have the privilege of viewing all of this as casual entertainment ."
13202,"it at least doesn't default to "" brown people bad !"" there's no "" communist "" anymore , though . the russian federation isn't remotely communist ."
13203,im comfortable saying we got lucky .
13204,we would be able to see the future though if we looked at russias long history of exactly this behavior .
13205,"it's not logical , but it is normal . huge parts of the us spoke german as their first or even only language up until wwi ."
13206,"youre not alone . i have several ukrainian , russian , and bulgarian friends here in canada and i was learning russian on duolingo just for fun as kinda the common denominator , but i switched to ukrainian when the war broke out my ukrainian buddy says his family in donetsk refuses to speak russian now too"
13207,"i've been teaching myself russian for the past few years because i ( mistakenly ) assumed that russia would try to modernize itself in the near future and therefore russian would be a useful language to know . i've stopped now though . no russian word will ever be spoken by me again . yes i know that means almost nothing coming from one random american , but it's something ."
13208,"isn't the streisand effect not even relevant here ? it was about suppressing information ... a photo or something ... so people posted it more . same with beyonce and that one picture of her looking like she-hulk . "" you can't see it ! delete it !"" -> "" what don't they want us to see ? spread it ! i want to see it !"" what does this have to do with any of that ?"
13209,"the streisand effect is when you try to hide or censor something and that draws attention to it . that has absolutely nothing to do with why finland is joining nato . finland is joining nato because russia broke its treaties and invaded another country , not because russia tried to censor ukraine ."
13210,"the true reason is economical in nature . a little over 10 years ago , a large amount of natural gas and petroleum was discovered in eastern ukraine , in the donbass region . a little under 10 years ago , ukraine's president made a unilateral decision out of nowhere to align the country with russia , rather than the eu as had been planned . shortly after this , a series of widespread protests removed him from office . shortly after that , russia invaded crimea and began funding separatists in eastern ukraine . ukraine then started trying to get into nato . ukraine was making steady progress towards that goal , and there were some who believed they might have been given an map ( membership action plan ) this summer at the nato summit . then suddenly russia decides to recognize donetsk and luhansk as independent republics , and then proceeds to invade to "" secure "" them . it all comes down to the fact that 45 % of russia's economy comes from oil and gas . if ukraine were to develop their oil and gas fields and start exporting that to the eu , the eu wouldn't need russian oil and gas ( which largely already transits through ukraine , so it wouldn't require a huge expensive pipeline project to get to eu nations ), which would cause the russian economy to severely contract if not outright collapse . like most modern wars , it ultimately comes down to petroleum resources ."
13211,"this is true and i'm happy to see you mention it -- until now , every mention of the budapest memorandum i've seen has been to complain about nato breaking it . that same , very short document includes a guarantee from russia to not only respect but actively * protect * ukraine's borders . i'm not sure it's possible to violate that more flagrantly than russia has ."
13212,"bribing , and ransomware"
13213,the war against ukraine would have looked vastly different if donald trump was still president of the usa . not to mention all the republicans who are still taking russian money .
13214,"they have been a huge impediment to modern progress in our world , the internet is dangerous mostly because of hackers from their country , yes i agree they are a relic of the past"
13215,"its pretty amazing how theyve managed to keep their influence over that large of land , but if you learn more about the land it holds , many of the citizens are low educated farmers who often grow up and stay where they were raised . unless they join the military ."
13216,i think the plan was to go to war while trump was in power but the logistics and planing took to long . when they were ready they did it anyway because the us and europe were in a perceived weakened position
13217,"also , shorter range - harder to shoot down/detect launch ."
13218,"only the ones from russia . they will have some mental gymnastics to do to figure out the truth , given what might be in their books"
13219,just a few months ....
13220,"gee , i wonder why ."
13221,it was a constant shame having him represent our country . there have been some bad presidents but talk about taking the cake and he wins hands down .
13222,"yeah , youre right in that regard . didnt think of nato for a second here , but the other , small ( and non nato ) nations around russia would have a bad time to say the least ."
13223,"well its not your/our fault that ukrainians are not trained with modern western equipment . they are working on this right now , though . ukraine wasnt exactly a western democratic poster child prior to this war ."
13224,i am happy for you
13225,"lithuania makes more sense , because of the corridor between belarus and kaliningrad , and kaliningrad itself ."
13226,"russia as a government might heavily believe nato would never attack , or it might not , or it might have elements in both camps . but its people have been told to worry about nato provocations and will thus demand a reaction to keep those borders secured . russia operates more on propaganda than direct forceful repression , so it will need a propaganda spin to explain why it's allowing mass nato troop movements in poland to go unmirrored that doesn't involve admitting "" everything of military value is tied up or burned down in ukraine , we are weak ."""
13227,"no military reason , but a propaganda one . it's kinda hard to justify ignoring nato troops on your border whilst pushing the "" oh noes were going to be invaded "" justification for a war against a non-nato country . very public statements like this can penetrate russia's propaganda and cause russians to question the justification for war . troop movements on borders can be independently verified by russians near those borders ."
13228,"the kremlin seems to not believe that , and feel like nato's solitary goal is to invade and overthrow the current government . could just be the projected propaganda or them thinking all other governments function the same way they do , saying one thing means doing the opposite ."
13229,"russia said they will have to increase military defense close to finland as a result of their nato bid . if nato increases military presence along the border , it'll scare the fuck out of them ."
13230,russia doesn't respect borders . so nato lining up troops inside their own borders is a mutil-layered problem . for russia .
13231,"> nato has made it clear again and again they will not cross their own borders . if putin trusts that , then he should have had no problem with ukraine joining nato ."
13232,"they've been making a display of wealth for sure , look at all those tanks they were giving away"
13233,im sure right now putin is wishing all that cash spent on yachts had gone into equipping and training his military now lol
13234,fun fact : a group of peafowl is called an ostentation
13235,"* ostrichensibly means "" while making a display of feathers "". use that instead ."
13236,"opulence , i has it .."
13237,here's hoping . putin's is the only cancer i'll cheer for .
13238,""" happy accident ""... happy mistake was actually said by a house painter named bub russ"
13239,"yes , yes we are . every god damned morning ."
13240,"at the rate russia is going through its tanks and armoured vehicles doesn't seem like nato should be too reliant on drones xd , but you're right though , couldn't hurt to have them"
13241,all quiet on the western flank . i think illwrite a book . 
13242,eastern nato flank 
13243,"russia tried to make a flank stake , only to be tenderized itself ."
13244,they secured the eastern flank with this maneuver by becoming a puppet to china .
13245,"can we meet in the middle and call it central flank ? i'm open to calling it central brisket , shank , or sirloin too ."
13246,i imagine a lot of upper russian brass are both pissed at putin for fucking things up so royally and also scared to death because he was dangerous and volatile even before he was cornered ..
13247,hmm they could use that but they already said one of the reason they hit ukraine was for the secret biological weapons lab that the us hid there . the us really need to rethink where they put those labs soo not a wise choice to put them next to the guys who supported the nazi regime in ww2 . (/ s )
13248,"china already have the people there . and since russia believe that a territory can be independent via plebiscite after the fact ( of annexation ) , russia can't complain while justifying their occupations ."
13249,does china have any claims on russian territory ?
13250,"russia would nuke their east than give it up to chinese control . that would be worst than a war with nato , as it's yet another publicly perceived "" ally "" betraying and taking the basis of economic stability ."
13251,all the countries were ready to fight world war 1 . if that archduke hadn't been blasted another excuse would be used .
13252,"well they were ready for normal war , not trench warfare which was inevitable considering the amount of firepower from both sides made it impossible to gain ground quickly"
13253,they were ready to fight but no one had the faintest clue how machine guns would change the face of war . hell even then the germans almost outflanked the allies and capture paris .
13254,that was because they thought that 17th century tactics would still work with machine guns
13255,which is why the german military is now rearming itself .
13256,russian forces are so dumb they still would fire on a civvie aircraft . they already did in 2014 . mh17 .
13257,ruler ? more like a yard stick
13258,"wait ' til she calls out all three of his names , slowly and just above a whisper ."
13259,and they've been getting away with it for a decades at this point . putin's basically been trying to reassemble the soviet union at gunpoint the whole fucking time he's been president .
13260,"that's another thing . jets that aren't mothballed need to be started and flown every once in a while to find out where and what is taking the most deterioration . similar to a car , you have to turn it on and take it for a spin or it rots in place . entropy isn't kind to unsupervised equipment ."
13261,"most of spywork is not the romanticized stuff . examples of valuable spywork : you work a courier as an asset . you make dilligent reports on companies he works . you make a note on companies with easy access . you put all that shit into excel file you don't know if it'll have use for . another analyst puts together similar report lists , builds a bigger file with cities and industries . again no clue what/if there will be use for it . a bunch of other analysts do nothing but hoard phone pictures from workers from identifiable companies . script marks ones that look like components , another transcribed visible markings . now 2022 comes , and russia is sanctioned to their tits . and that's when you tap into all this data you were gathering . look for companies that work together to find among e-mails , pictures etc a mention of component of company you know that uses it . or maybe just similar component naming theme will help identify manufacturer of a chip or optics . using other sets of data you determine which companies to target to steal a phone or laptop , or plant a pineapple to gather data we don't think of as sensitive . a name of contact in purchasing that does favours for colleagues might prove instrumental to be able to circumvent sanctions on key element . or someone namedropping a recently fired employee might lead to breach of data if you can get their login credentials and they turn out to work because a complately different set of reports indicates this company matches access rights to employee accounts only at specific intervals . and if you get lucky , you could be one unattended laptop away from getting access to technical data ."
13262,it means you support the russian invasion .
13263,"moving to a foreign country , acting like you own the place and never learning the local language used to be a very western european thing to do ."
13264,the russians who go choose to the baltic states are not the same as the russians who aim to emigrate to countries further west . those russians have an imperialistic mindset and still see the baltics as part of the soviet union . it isn't a fair comparison .
13265,"let's be real , the younger generation speaks the language , some do it quite well . many actually got citizenship by now ( like over a half or russian-speaking people in latvia are citizens ), and you can't do it without sufficient knowledge or being born after 1991 . but also there was literally zero actual push in 30 years from the government to integrate those russians beyond teaching the language as mandatory in schools and some courses , and that's about it ."
13266,"> refuse to learn and speak local languages to this day , or integrate in any meaningful way . are you talking about the english ?"
13267,and ukrainian farmers are stealing their tires while they wait for gas .
13268,also just to put this out there russia is running out of modern tanks as shown in ukraine they are deploying tanks from the 1990s and 1980s .
13269,and they've even found a way to sweden the deal .
13270,"not really . firstly , ussr spent several years , not months , in afghanistan . secondly , high casualty numbers don't necessarily mean their army was shit . their doctrine is different . value of human life was always lower in soviet union . it was expected . thirdly , soviet controlled territories were dominated by soviet army . mujahideen didn't really challenge them . eventually , the cost of afghan intervention became too high even for ussr , but their army wasn't beaten ."
13271,many governments originated in that sort of manner . we'd just call them royalty
13272,"> it's not hyperbole , [ it's history .]( > > they came to power through illegal activity , made their money through seizing businesses and extortion ( amongst other things ), there's never been a reason to assume they'd stop commiting crimes . [ not particularly a change from their nation of inspiration : the pre-empire mongolian raiders ]("
13273,"> russia looked at north korea and thought "" you know what ? i want that too !"". poverty , corruption , indoctrination , and if any other country doesn't do what you want you threaten to nuke them [ russia hasn't adopted that from north korea , the inspiration for corrupt authoritarianism was the other way around . authoritarianism trends toward kleptocracy and stealing any resources you can grab from neighbors , the same as mongolian raiders ]("
13274,tbf that was because the government banned speaking german when america entered ww1
13275,"russia was first to denounce the budapest memorandum , claiming that the ukrainian state post-revolution is not the same state as the one mentioned in the memorandum ."
13276,"bribing , ransomware/cyber attacks , and poison"
13277,"the internet is dangerous and russia is not the only malevolent actor . if they were to go off line , the security issues would not change . imo they have had a somewhat positive impact on hardening large portions before wwiii by imposing a cost to ambivalence that was too dangerous to ignore for critical systems . however , there's no doubt that the internet is unprepared for a world war and will be a historical failure shortly after the start of one ."
13278,"over half of russia have a tertiary education , putting it at one of the highest percentages of university educated adults in the world , and double the average of other countries . it's also one of the most popular countries for foreign students worldwide and has one of the lowest gender differentials for different educational fields . regardless of your opinion on russia , many of them being low educated is not it . whether you're in vladivostok , novobrisk or moscow you will find most people around you will have obtained a degree . if anything , it's more disturbing that we have one of the most educated populaces yet some of the worst decision making when it comes to politics ."
13279,"people seem to forget that russia's war against western democracy is not contained to ukraine . russia has been intentionally radicalizing the far-right in america and as we speak the gop is working towards more and more authoritarian power grabs meant to solidify their positions in power and dismantle any form of democracy that gets in their way . russia's war against democracy has multiple fronts and while they may be losing in ukraine , they're kicking our ass here in america ."
13280,"we've had advisors and trainers over there since crimea . we're sending them drone-borne explosives . it's not that they can't use cutting edge , we just aren't willing to hurt our own readiness that much . but even so , the tech we're sending is far from obsolete , even more so because the toys russia is using does border on obsolete ."
13281,they donated an entire battleship to the sea gods . they are basically philanthropists .
13282,""" yuri ! bring me a bigger table ."""
13283,i can believe russia is so rich they are also giving away mega yachts too !!
13284,very nouveau riche culture tbh
13285,it really shows how insidious corruption is
13286,"a group of flamingoes is a flamboyance ! not sure why birds get all the best collective group names ; murder of corvids , parliament of owls , etc ."

13292,who ever thought there could be an upside to cancer ?
13293,"sometimes you think . that's my enemy , there's no way i could ever love him . he has continuisly ruined my life , my friend's lives and those of my family as well . he is the worst despicably low creature on the planet . then an even worse enemy comes along and suddenly you're screaming "" you can do it cancer !!!"""
13294,"particularly since he had personal experience , i can not imagine bob ross being in support of more war anywhere ."
13295,it's the middle flank .

13302,"would willing be the better phrasing , rather then ready i don't hunk anyone nation was ready , but a few were willing"
13303,"they were ready for ** colonial war ** where your machine guns and artillery are facing off again spears , bows , and muskets . europe was not ready to deal with foes on an even footing ."
13304,he meant that as in : they turn on their transponders so as to ensure there's no in-air collision with a civvie .
13305,that wasn't stupidity . they knew exactly what they were doing .
13306,i wish we could put russia up for adoption .
13307,"europe is better than that , they'd use a meter stick"
13308,* meter stick .
13309,* meter stick * because rest of the world .
13310,"when i used to work aircraft one saying that stuck with me was "" schedule maintenance for your equipment or it will schedule it for you """
13311,> entropy isn't kind to unsupervised equipment . as chinese tires on russian vehicles has been showing . the only thing you need to stop them from shredding like that is * cardboard *. they weren't even storing their vehicles or supplies properly .
13312,100 %. even my car feels like shit when i take it out of storage in the spring . the best thing for any machine is to be used .
13313,spies are gonna get in regardless .
13314,"those motherfuckers flushed millions of dollars through the nra and a variety of other right wing groups . russian money and other assets helped trump get elected and he was perilously close to a second term where he would have withdrawn the us from nato , which is why putin backed him . russian spies can wreak havoc . fuck our fbi for failing to stop this ."
13315,"i mentioned this in another comment , but i feel like * immigrant * spies are relatively easy to stop . i mean , you're talking about infiltrating the government , but why do we have to allow them into government positions ? the most sensitive positions ( i.e ., with security clearance ) usually already involve pretty rigorous screening that even looks for things like how easily you could be blackmailed . surely considering how long you've been in a hostile country or if you have family in one is a part of that already ? i also think that russia already has a huuuuge number of spies or what's effectively spies in the form of actual natural born citizens that have been radicalized . the numerous controversies with the american gop is a prominent example , but it's hardly unique to the us . e.g ., france came * scary * close to electing le pen , who has ties to russia and has declared support for putin multiple times . they might not be the traditional sort of spy , but the alt right seems just as happy to hand over sensitive secrets to russia ."
13316,we had one in the white house not that long ago .
13317,hell the nra was basically proven to be a russian front and look how much damage they've done .
13318,"the most damaging spies are rarely adversarial personnel , they tend to be one of your own. american military contractors have been caught selling nuclear secrets for paltry sums of $ 100k ."
13319,"for that , you subvert locals rather than trying to infiltrate your own spies . those just work as handlers"
13320,still is . just look at all the brits in spain .
13321,"at least when you meet an englishman in spain ( just for example ) the first thing you hear isn't very likely to be "" it was so much better in the soviet union """
13322,i don't think they want those cheap ass chinese tires .
13323,"actually , the tires are worthless because they were never kept to proper pressure or regularly rotated . they sat in one spot with a couple tons of metal bearing down . thats why there were a shit load of tire blowouts in those convoys early on in the war . anything that wasnt regularly used was essentially waiting for a blowout ."
13324,russian soldiers cant have shit in ukraine
13325,"they were deploying those tanks first to begin with . only recently did they let the t90s (?) go out . even then , first one was taken out within a week . im pretty sure a good amount of the rest were also destroyed . they have no t-14s to deploy as far as im aware . too expensive , and they have no reliable way to get foreign parts for procuring and production"
13326,they're even deploying tanks now that were built in the 60s and 70s ...
13327,"> 1990s and 1980s . 1960s if you don't mind , 1960s . t-62 was introduced in 1961 . even t-72 entered production in 1969 , although in what quantities i can't say ."
13328,norway that could ever happen .
13329,"so , i'm going to clarify . you don't actually have to use force to * beat * an army . they most certainly still were defeated in afghanistan , but not in the conventional way . if they had no choice but to pull out , i can see that as nothing else but a defeat ."
13330,"and the rest of the western world , like france , too"
13331,"the recent rise of authoritarianism around the world is absolutely attributable to putin's information war . the amount of resources a country can bring to any task is absolutely insane , and he's spent years filling the internet with misinformation , courting fascist politicians , etc . ask any mod of a reasonably popular subreddit and they'll tell you how much easier their job got when the war in ukraine started ... or they won't respond because putin stopped paying them ."

13351,"so youre saying they have a candidate in manchuria then , a sort of manchurian candidate perhaps "
13352,"hmm , china being the most important and leading , albeit isolationistic , country in the world for most part of history , only just having lost that status after the age of discovery , i'd say it's a wonder there aren't more disputes ."
13353,have you watched the kingsman prequel ?
13354,one horribly inbred family . the european people kept having horribly sick kids and that snowballed into chaos as they grew up into adults or just plain didn't grow up .
13355,"doubt it . what would their expected benefit be ? i see no reason not to believe the currently most widely accepted explanation : russia gave sams to idiots , idiots saw something that vaguely looked like a military transport , and ( being idiots ) shot without verifying ."
13356,china's ready to take her .
13357,"speaking as an extraterrestrial secret agent spying on earth , none of us want to adopt russia"
13358,i wanted to downvote this so bad . but rembered i'm an imperialist . sae for life 
13359,"these weren't chinese tires , they were a russian copy of a chinese copy of an american tire . the chinese copy is apparently decent and widely used in china ."
13360,"they don't even need to "" get in "" at all when bribery of politicians is legal . the money needs to get in , and everyone loves money too much to stop that ."
13361,"we're talking about nations of millions of people . it's never about "" can thing x happen "" but rather "" how much can thing x happen ."" regarding espionage , there is a time cost for developing domestic assets . by constraining the flow of foreign assets , you reduce the overall capacity for action . for example one element of counter-espionage is the flushing of suspected assets out of a specific sector/agency/whatever , which forces your enemy to reacquire assets before they can regain the same capacity to act within that niche again . the looser your restrictions over the flow of people , the more such capacity your enemy can hold in reserve , and the more they can parallelize the effort to redevelop domestic assets . am i saying that they should close the borders ? no . i'm only saying that "" spies are going to get in regardless "" has no real meaning to the decision , because what really matters is how many spies are getting in over a given unit of time ."
13362,and otherwise we have a divide in europe . so they can always recruit here .
13363,more important they are already in . a spy that arrives just as the war starts is hardly useful without any connections .
13364,i think there's a lot of stuff that goes on in security clearance screening among the rank and file that weeds this stuff out but among the political class there are no safeguards in place . we saw this time and again in the previous administration as well as the various congressmen that appear to be compromised as well .
13365,and in prison until the cheeto baby set him free .
13366,and how much damage they're still doing . despite being outed as a russian front they still have republican politicians by the balls .
13367,really coulda just said the us republican party .
13368,yeah that's very true we really need a better way to fight that crap
13369,or the retired americans in mexico
13370,tells you how bad putins russia is .
13371,"i suggest you visit estonia if you think they've solved their issues with the russian speakers . i'm not even sure what you mean by "" tied nationality to the language "". are you referring to the non-citizen passports ? we have those in latvia too . we didn't just grant all the russians citizenship after regaining independence . and lithuania doesn't have nearly as big of a russian population as we and estonia do ."
13372,"i was thinking they might make good tire swings , but theyre probably full of carcinogenic crap you dont want around your kids ."
13373,its worse . theyre not chinese . theyre belarusian copies of chinese copies of german/french/american/japanese tires .
13374,thought that they use quality soviet tires
13375,"i love this . god , what a fuckup ."
13376,"furthermore , they were left outdoors in this condition for such a long time the rubber perished from uv exposure , becoming brittle . didnt stand a chance ."
13377,"they maybe had 20 t-14's to begin with , they sent a couple for trials in syria then pulled them out . i doubt very much any of them are combat capable . if even one is , they're not going to send it out , the millisecond it's destroyed , images of it will be put all over the internet for everyone to see ."
13378,essentially the ukraine war is a proxy war between the west and russia . the west needs to provide russia with as much as possible so russia will never think about invading the baltics .
13379,almost like metal coffins when you factor in that ukraine has modern anti tank weapons .
13380,"i will say that this can be a tricky basis to measure effectiveness on . many countries modernize older tanks into being nearly comparable to modern tanks . i would say russian equipment isn't really that bad . the biggest issue is that russia has terrible strategic , tactical and logistic coordination . russia hasn't really established air superiority which has given ukraine significantly more room to maneuver and counter russian attacks . ukraine should not be able to establish artillery positions , those should be easy targets for the russian air force . but , lucky russian incompetence has allowed ukraine to set up positions and shell russian forces . and it seems that russian vehicles often don't have sufficient infantry support . which allows anti-tank armed ukrainians to take out russian armor . a competent military leadership in russia likely could have used its equipment to much greater effect in this war . but , fortunately , russia is controlled by a bunch of corrupt oligarchs who have thrown away a lot of pretty decent military equipment ."
13381,denmark that front closed .
13382,"yes , if the purpose of the russian army was to be an occupying force , it seemed they failed to achieve that objective . everything just said about the ussr and afghanistan was identical to what happened with the us and vietnam . of course , its a lot harder to conquer territory and hold that territory for any length of time , which is why offensive campaigns to capture territory tend to fail in the long term ."
13383,love that show

13387,"these sound so silly fun i thought you were joking . but no , that's all true : o"
13388,"you really want someone with brain cancer and a lack of morality holding the nuke button . putin didn't become less of a threat . he has nothing to lose . 3 modern nukes set off at the same time would be enough to kill most if not all people on earth . not by the nukes , but by the nuclear winter that would kill off most life ."
13389,why can't we hope for both with a side of parkinson's ?
13390,i just want his shriveled testicles to ache until he dies .
13391,could he please get lead poisoning like in the next half hour ? would be terribly appreciated . also all other poisonings .
13392,"idk man , supposedly he had a procedure to drain abdominal fluid ( ascites ). if that's true , that's a sign hes in the end stages of cancer ( liver/abdominal/pancreas maybe ) and indicates poor prognosis ( obv )"
13393,"yet they have the resilience of cockroaches somehow . seems like the worst of the worst are the ones able to spring back somehow . these awful people get cancers , anureysmes , shot , stabbed , etc and they are walking around just fine days later . i'm gonna slip on a patch of ice outside my door step in winter and bang my elbow and die from a resulting blood clot ."
13394,"no , why ? i have no idea what kingsman is ."
13395,tbh that movie is how i learned of the fact
13396,ever seen pictures of the hapsburg jaw ? yikes !
13397,"> russia gave sams to idiots , sam's require weeks sand weeks of training to operate . you can't just fire one up and know what you're looking at , let alone lock on and fire a missile at something . by all accounts the aa vehicle from that 2014 incident arrived in ukraine from russia the night before , then was taken back to russia after it shot down the civilian jet . it would have had to have a russian crew with it . there was also an aeroflot flight that a short time later passed over roughly the same area as the jet that was shot down . there is a theory that argues that the buck aa launcher was brought into ukraine the day before for the sole purpose of carrying out a false-flag attack on the civilian aeroflot ( a russian-owned jet mostly carrying russian passengers ) to give russia the justification it needed to invade/annex crimea and maybe even more territory ."
13398,"probably to push buttons and see if they could get away with it , which they largely did ."
13399,"pretty sure that's more like the "" ass to ass "" scene than an adoption ."
13400,i thought it was a french tire ? weren't the originals michelins ?
13401,spies bought an entire political party in america . they are indeed still dangerous .
13402,"my dad's cousin got murdered by the soviets in the 70s in angola and for years he was all like "" ugh death to russians !"". since trump got elected he's all like "" putin's such a smart guy "". arguing with fascists is impossible because they make no sense ."
13403,"> i still don't get how republicans , allegedly the most pro usa and anti communism people , got converted into russia fanatics in last 10-20 years they've been chasing money since reagan at the latest . their rhetoric has been for the consumption of the under-informed for decades , all while they have their hands out for any saudi prince or russian oligarch willing to hand over a few bucks . they don't care about the blood , they just want their pieces of silver ."
13404,"democrats agreed russia was bad news , so republicans , nostrils deep in their hatred of democrats , converted to fans of russia . american republicans oppose whatever american democrats want . a big part of why is because american democrats elected a black man to the presidency twice ."
13405,"they had a common enemy in hillary clinton , so they took material support from america's enemies to defeat her ."
13406,"this passes me off so bad . if i said some of the stuff our reps/senators/prior potus said publically , my clearance would be revoked so fast it would make my head spin . if i had a russian wife i'd never have been able to get it to begin with ."
13407,"the nra regulatory captured the entire gop , then got them to whip the gop base into taking the position that any gun safety regulation whatsoever is an attack on the constitution , so now it doesnt matter theyre exposed to be a corrupt russian front . the gop currently will not negotiate any sort of measure to prevent what happened in uvalde ( and parkland , and sandy hook , and too many others to name back to at least columbine ) from happening again . so , theyve taken the position that school childrens deaths are an acceptable consequence of their chosen interpretation of the 2nd amendment ."
13408,or those germans in argentina . there's this one dude with a toothbrush mustache who especially annoys me with his overly dramatic speeches .
13409,"no , it usually is supposed to show how bad the west is . but these people wouldn't take a train ticket to take a ride into russia , so they're probably left mentally disabled after all the brain fucking that regine did , and still does ."
13410,that'd be all tires .
13411,"naah , belorusians can make tires if in need . they just don't bother since pay is the same and they have to hurry to second job to make something else really fast to be able to get to their third job to be able to friggin pay for food also ."
13412,many vehicles do still have soviet tires on them . so quality 30 + year old soviet tires .
13413,"that happened already , didn't it ? or was that the t90m ?"
13414,"plus does the t-90 really compare well against the ukrainian t-84 and others ? i honestly have no idea , but it wouldn't be a stretch to me ."
13415,i believe you meant that the west needs to provide ukraine with as much as possible ?
13416,insinuating that ukraine is a mere proxy seems rather insulting . proxy wars are wars instigated by a third party using a proxy . russia instigated the war with ukraine and ukraine responded . neither one of them is a proxy being directed by another . the habit in the west of calling every conflict a proxy war on behalf of major powers feels extremely arrogant .
13417,so literal metal coffins .
13418,exactly . what you said and i want him gone forever starting now !
13419,now are we hoping for ingested or forcefully injected lead poisoning ?
13420,trump was too out of it to protest the doctors at walter reed from jabbing him with every anti-covid treatment possible .

13424,they got away with a chemical weapons attack in salisbury killing a british citizen . testing the water maybe
13425,"they got away with it just like other countries that did the same . [ the us shooting down an iranian plane ]( [ ukraine accidentally shooting down a russian plane during a joint ukraine-russia exercise ]( [ iran shooting down a ukrainian plane ]( wikipedia has a [ list ]( the reaction seems to be pretty consistent : it's a huge embarrassment for the country that did it , there's usually some apologies and compensation , and that's it . i think the theory that they killed random civilians , [ most of which were from otherwise uninvolved countries ]( just to see if they could , seems rather far fetched ."
13426,the button do not press! . that button ?
13427,[.](
13428,"yes , but iirc all the michelin truck tires the us army uses are designed and manufactured in the us ."
13429,they are knockoffs so now theyre michaelins .
13430,"i only buy tires at whole foods , i'm good ."
13431,"i mean , thats true with most countries . the iphone is made in china and well made , for example . it all depends on what the purchaser specs their purchases for ."
13432,that was the t90m . i doubt very much any t14 will leave russia anytime soon .
13433,the t90 is a t72 with some fancy optics and other bits tacked on .
13434,"well , the west * is * providing weapons to russia , through ukraine . it's just that those weapons are being delivered at rather high velocities ."
13435,"i mean they're providing russia with a lot of bullets and missiles , at least . one at a time ."
13436,metal coffins tend to have fewer holes in them

13443,"ah , so that'd be a no then , like wouldn't a t-64 give one a run for its money then ?"
13444,i think it's more than one at a time . more like in large numbers at a fast rate of delivery
13445,i don't know shit about military equipment but that one thing that the west recently sent the other day looked like it was sending about 40 missiles ( or whatever they're called ) at a time . :)
13446,"actually nato does take nuclear war seriously , that's why it's never been threatened blindly by nato ."
13447,"if they did , we would never hear the end of it . every time they wanted new territory or some diplomatic concession they could just play the nuke card"
13448,"the world i believe is taking it seriously . nobody wants it . it's damn russia and putin threatening it over and over because it's obvious their military sucks and cannot win a conventional war anymore . the minute he makes that decision , he and his country is toast too . i really don't want me or my.family to die because of seriously cancer ridden 70 year old asshole dictator and madman ."
13449,the russia that cried wolf
13450,""" we're trying to scare you ! why aren't you reacting ?"" russia is like a toddler that's not getting their way ."
13451,"russia is the one not taking the threat of nuclear war seriously , because mad isn't a threat for just one of the factions . every time they threaten nukes they are loudly declaring "" i will commit suicide and have you to murder my entire population if i don't get my way "", which doesn't seem like a credible threat ."
13452,why arent you taking our constant threat of world annihilation seriously !?
13453,"russia is wrong . nato * is * taking this seriously , * very * seriously , and that's exactly why you won't hear about it in the news media . unlike * certain countries *, competent nations do not go broadcasting their most serious shit for all the world to see . they keep that shit quiet ."
13454,"thing is why would the west say what they are doing to prepay . i guarantee there are us , uk and french subs sitting around with their nukes firmly pointed at the kremlin . if you have a deterrent there is no point in putting it away . the posture by nato right now regarding nukes is the same as it is anytime as they are always ready . all these russians are sounding like stuck up tantrum throwing kids now"
13455,"which is a good thing . if the us really thought that putin was going to launch , moscow would already be rubble ."
13456,""" why are you guys not listening ? flinch please ! "
13457,"why arent you taking this threat seriously !!! - russia why are you not taking natos threat seriously ? its like russia is saying , im threatening you ! why arent you threatened ! you must fear me ! fear me ! fear me now ! fucking child state"
13458,did they expect the west to withdraw all support from ukraine because putin threaten to go nuclear ? mustve been disappointed by the result then .
13459,"how are we supposed to respond ? there are two possibilities : russia is bluffing or russia is serious . from that , we have four cases : 1 . russia is bluffing and we call their bluff . we win by not giving into their demands and utterly crushing them . 2 . russia is bluffing and we believe them . they win and will undoubtedly keep pushing the envelope . 3 . russia isn't bluffing but we think they are . they nuke us , leading to a nuclear exchange that launches the world into a nuclear autumn or nuclear winter . 4 . russia isn't bluffing and we believe them . they win and will undoubtedly keep pushing the envelope . obviously the only case there at all acceptable to us leadership is 1 . sure , cases 2 and 4 seem preferable to case 3 , but also would embolden russia and probably ultimately lead to case 3 or somehow a non-nuclear ww3 anyways . from that , us leadership really has no choice but to pursue case 1 . mad stops working when one or more players cease acting in a rational manner ."
13460,""" we demand to be taken seriously """
13461,russia threatening nukes is like me repeatedly threatening to kick mike tyson's ass . the second i actually make a move i'll be missing both ears ... and maybe be in a coma .
13462,"russia , the new north korea ."
13463,has someone kept count of how many times the russians formally mention nukes since the start of the war ?
13464,i can't believe actual adults speak like this
13465,nato is most definitely taking the thret seriously . increased satellite monitoring and intell gathering . bit honestly how can you take it seriously beyond preparing for a counter strike after russia has launched .
13466,"his audience is us , citizens . he wants us scared , so we put political pressure on our leaders to back off . he knows and his government knows nato is taking the threats seriously ."
13467,were super serial this time! 
13468,"i'm sorry .... which nuclear war threat , exactly ? the 4 russia issued today , the 3 issued yesterday , the 7 issued the day before that ..... etc ?"
13469,if nato wasn't taking it seriously your entire country would be wiped off the face of the earth by now .
13470,"that's because nato knows that if russia uses a nuke , russia will cease to exist . putin may be stupid , but he's not that stupid ."
13471,"sorry , but there's been so many threats lately a backlog has formed . we will hear all threats in due time , please be seated and do not rise until your number has been called . please stay as your threats are very important to us ."
13472,"fuck off , to be honest . trash fucking country"
13473,"russia is the only one violating international law . if they want to escalate , they will become a hole in the ground ."
13474,"we judge russia by their actions , not their words . they keep making nuclear threats , but they are not taking actions to posture their nuclear weapons to back them up . they have not deployed additional nuclear submarines . there has been no discernible change in activity around their nuclear silos . no additional nuclear weapon systems have been mobilized and no tactical nuclear weapons have been deployed , anywhere . their nuclear doctrine has not been updated and they continue to follow it ( for example , providing the usual advance warning of tests ). this is all just diplomatic rhetoric , likely intended for the domestic audience . if russian actions change , so will natos response ."
13475,"russia doesnt use nukes not because of the kindness of their hearts . they dont use nukes because they know it will lead to mutually assured destruction . thats it . thats the only reason . russians are animals that dont value life , and they get great pride out of that . listen to the stories of what happened to germans in wwii . listen to whats happening in ukraine now . they dont care ."
13476,"oh we're deadly fucking serious , anatoly . you keep fucking around , you are most certainly going to find out just how seriously we are all taking you . you're going to wish you really were the clown you're afraid everyone thinks you are ."
13477,"well if russia is worried about nuclear war , they should withdraw from ukraine and then there wont be any misunderstandings ."
13478,"well the problem is , if we do take it "" seriously "" we are then giving in to endless nuclear blackmail ."
13479,well when you threaten to nuke everyone 50 times a day then it's hard to take it seriously .
13480,russia : we have nukes the rest of the world : this is the 7th week in a row you've shown your nukes in class [ lo and behold i found one from know your meme lol .](
13481,wanna see russia invaded by the entire fucking world and putin hung while people cheer ?
13482,"finland here . yeah . if you constantly threat us with nukes , those threats really stop being effective after a while ."
13483,wouldnt it be nice if those hackers could disable those rockets
13484,"russia wants to literally steal a country next door to them , the civilized world is outraged . russia threatens to destroy the world . putin is as crazy as a shit house rat . am sure china is questioning who its been hanging out with ; one billion chinese lives matter too ill wager ."
13485,"well what the fuck does he expect ? what is nato supposed to do ? help russia fucking fight ukraine ? god damn , fuck russia . what a bunch of fucking idiots ."
13486,"no we are not taking your threats seriously . russia , read your own nuclear doctrine . non of the four scenarios in which you could use nuclear force can happen as a result of this conflict . you are saber rattling . we know it . now shut up ."
13487,"because they are 5 year old temper-tantrum throwing thugs who are pissed their threats didn't work the first 10 times . so they think that all important 11th time is going to be so super different . oh hey , since we're here and all , who in here at any point in their life mentioned , to anyone for any reason , that they thought putin was : brilliant , peerless in his skills , the manliest man who ever lived , made out of bullets and bandoleers , a tactician and strategist to have libraries written about and a true leader for his nation ? i ask this because i honestly just wanna make fun of you :)"
13488,"the nuclear word is the only reason you haven't been completely removed from this world ( i mean the russian leaders,not the civilians )"
13489,lol not our first rodeo . us receiving nuclear threats is a yearly tradition with north korea .
13490,nuke threats go both ways comrade . you launch a nuke this way hundreds are coming for russia . no length of table is long enough for your pathetic hitler wannabe to hide under .
13491,i grew up under the threat of nuclear war . you kind of just become numb to it . fucking do it if youre going to do it or shut up about it .
13492,"nuclear weapons and their utilization falls into two categories , defensive and offensive . to utilize them in an offensive capacity , is to initiate a higher probability of invoking defensive utilization , therefore they are naturally and by default , defensive . to utilize them offensively or as contingencies for failed imperialism and conquest , is to be a natural terrorist state , and makes your state subject to the global contempt of your implicated activities , and ensures the collapse of your national leadership ."
13493,i have 900 cans of beefaroni stockpiled .
13494,"and in this new world where everybody understands that cowering to someone who uses nuclear threats under a mad doctrine simply doesn't work anymore . nuclear powers still need to have boots on the ground instead of sitting in a comfy chair and blathering "" i'll nuke you if i don't get my way ""."
13495,"us and uk are taking nuclear threat very seriously , thats why they have authorized military action against ruzzia if it decides to use nukes , even the smaller tactical ones ."
13496,for some reason this makes me think of the i showed you my dick . please respond [ meme .](
13497,"yeah russia , if youre gonna do it , then fucking do it ; weve got student loan payments and hospital bills piling up that a lot of us are cool with armageddon . itd be a fuck-ton better than the slow , creeping death due to climate catastrophes and our souls constantly being grounded down ."
13498,russia is like that scammer that caught you jerking off on camera . it will threaten you and ask for a 100 dollars . once you pay it they will ask for another 100 .. and another .. might as well shout to the world that you are a horny fucker caught with his pants down and take the 15 mins of shame ( fame ?) then a lifetime of paying just because they have something to use against you . once they send that video the threat is gone and so is the leverage so why go through the effort
13499,"after witnessing the best russia has to offer in ukraine , i expect at least half of these nukes would detonate before leaving their poorly maintained silos lol . the other half would probably fall back towards russia soil before wiping them out ."
13500,correct . nobody is taking putins threat to commit suicide seriously .
13501,we dont negotiate with terrorists .
13502,russian ambassador : you're not taking our insane nuclear war threats seriously ! u.s .: thats because we assume you're sane . russian ambassador : see what i mean ??!!
13503,russia is making things out to be like we all need to come together to stop a nuclear war from happening and the us isnt doing their part when the threat of nuclear war is coming from them
13504,russia is the one that doesn't seem to be taking it seriously .
13505,what a crock of poop ! the russian nuclear doctrine 2020 ( signed off by putin ) clearly and explicitly says as a response to use of nuclear or wmdif the very existence of the russian federation is jeopardized . no matter what happens in ukraine ( presuming ru does * not * use nukes ) there is absolutely no danger of the russian federation facing an existential crisis .
13506,"russia , you don't want nato taking that threat seriously ..."
13507,russian ambassador - go fuck yourself ! - us citizen
13508,"if they took the threats seriously , they would be pre emptively striking first ."
13509,"these threats grow weary , there's a saying we have in the anglosphere that could do wonders for the russian foreign ministry ... * shit , or get off the pot .*"
13510,"if you constantly threaten everything you threaten nothing . what's the alternative , to give them any thing they want all the time ?"
13511,to take it seriously would be to not threaten it in the first place you fucking psychos
13512,russia is right . we should get our nukes ready and make sure we are prepared to completely erase russia from the map if they use nuclear weapons .
13513,i suspect that the us is taking it quite seriously . russia may want to double-check where all of the us nuclear subs are .
13514,"lets put it this way , all the technology surrounding nuclear weapons shown to civilians would be the last weapons used in a nuclear war , just like how non gps guided bombs would be used last vs precision guided bombs ( they are outdated ). we are the inventors of nuclear weaponry , we have had 77 years since the atomic bombs . meaning we have had 77 years of nuclear advancements and since we are the creators , we are the most advanced when it comes to nuclear technology . russia i already know what type of technology you have and ever since the start of the war with ukraine , i have discovered its limits . complexity is what you have , and complexity is what lost us the vietnam war . meaning your nuclear weapons are more complex rather than actually usable , just like the m16 rifle we used in vietnam .. shit wont work half the time because it is too complex . i dont think you really want to know what we have because if you did , you would commit suicide and leave the ukraine war to someone who is actually capable of winning . dont threaten the european powers with nuclear war because you might get what you are asking for , just like the ukraine . you got what you asked for , and that was blood for mud . we dont give a fuck , because we know the outcome . the united states not giving a fuck about a world powers nukes should give you more alarm as to what you are doing as a leader yourself , because if the united states is not scared of your nukes , then you should be more scared of the united states . we care more when north korea threatens nukes , and that should tell you something about your arsenal . imagine being so blinded by the blood in the mud that you actually think you would win a bigger war , just because you have outdated nukes like iran or something . mother fucker you cant even win a small war ."
13515,"they are always taking it seriously . i guarantee you since this war started , nato has been readying , testing , and progressing it's anti-missile technology non-stop , every day . russia ( and the rest of us ) are about to find out what tricks nato has up it's sleeve when putin tries to launch . they may be in for a very nasty surprise ."
13516,russia should have kept the illusion from before the invasion that they actually had a capable military that the west should respect . now they have to resort to constant nuclear threats because they dont have any other leverage . we know theyre just a loudmouth bully and we need to treat them as such .
13517,"wtf do they want people to do ? drop everything and praise them ? stop being dicks and pull out of ukraine's ass . yes , the us are fuckin assholes cause we did the same thing to middle east countries . doesn't mean it's okay on any side ."
13518,every time they wanted new territory or some diplomatic concession they could just play the nuke card
13519,i'm old man with fat face and smoll dick . i nuke you now because smoll dick and fat face !
13520,you guuuuyyyysss ! youre * supposed * to * do * what we want because we are very scary !
13521,"** russia :** ukraine not taking peace talks seriously ** russia :** nato not taking nuclear war threat seriously ** russia :** the warts on my di .. ** everyone else :** "" just pack your bags and fuck off home !"""
13522,"this is a click bait title , if anyone is surprised . he's not actually threatening nuclear war in his comments he's basically saying that in the old days the west would have kept their nose out of the conflict to avoid any confrontation with russia or the ussr . russia is just shocked that people won't leave them alone while they try and annex an entire country because they have nukes ."
13523,"even if we did , the public is too numb to react to it anymore . i have been hearing russia's nuclear threats even before 2014 , now it's several times a day ."
13524,the us is not gonna be taken hostage and let russia roll over europe . so put up or shut up about the nukes ivan
13525,meh . as a cold war kid i was taught to hate ruzzia . it's nice to have company on the hatewagon . who wants shotgun ?
13526,"until ' the rich people ' are hurt , nobody takes anything serious ."
13527,its called mutually assured destruction 
13528,if we werent russia would already be a desert . its the only reason nato isnt flying over ukraine .
13529,"and yet , russia is not taking the guaranteed nuclear counterstrike threat seriously ."
13530,"seems to me that nukes work as an offensive tool only when you use them , but work fine as a defensive tool with only the threat of using them . somehow russia doesn't grasp this basic concept ."
13531,youre not appreciating the fact that were really fucking stupid enough 
13532,"at this point , i dont know if anyone is taking russia seriously ."
13533,russia knows it would become a vast desolate ___blank___ even moreso than they * pretty much * always have been . mutually assured destruction is a lot more tenuous when previous actions will lead to emptying silos .
13534,"more like russia isn't taking the nuke threat seriously , do they really think that using a nuke will get people to back off and let them have their way , its what will turn everyone against them , and since they already escalated to the nuclear option , the retaliation would devastate them ."
13535,"no shit . taking it seriously means giving them whatever they want , whenever they want it ."
13536,because everyone knows the * public * doctrine declared by russia is that nukes would only be used if someone else strikes first . anything else by shock jocks and politicians is just empty saber rattling .
13537,i'd argue russia is not taking nuclear war seriously . they keep invading allied regions and waving nuclear threats around willy-nilly .
13538,"nato , you are not taking our threat to use nukes seriously ! are you trying to start something by saying that you won't start anything ? it's a dangerous provocation ! we beg you , for the sake of everybody including ourselves , to seriously consider that we very well might start something ourselves ! we will be forced to do this by your arrogant refusal to believe us when we say that we don't want you to start anything by refusing to believe that we will start something ! you're forcing us to use a nuke to demonstrate how very much we don't want nuclear war ! it's your fault !"
13539,"why should we ? russia hasnt posed a significant nuclear threat to the us in decades . decades they have spent in decline , and decades the us spent in progress . the russians will saber-rattle . the us continues to speak quietly and wield a very large stick . let the exasperate during their death throws . the wold will be better for it ."
13540,"russian ambassador , go fuck yourself"
13541,"this is a pretty crazy shift in history that could be coming , for the first time in hundreds of years everyone ismt scared of russia anymore"
13542,"i interact with veterans of the u.s military all the time . despite the problems in our armed forces , i 100 % believe if push comes to shove and whoevers military is most capable , prepared , and advanced enough to take out our enemies and prevent as much counter damage as scientifically/militarily/humanly can prevent then my money is on the united states . i hope mankind never sees another nuclear weapon used , but if the time comes to go all in then i'm happy to know the u.s will defend me with everything it has ."
13543,so what is the ambassador saying . that putin is truly batshit crazy and ready to end civilization basically .
13544,"russian ambassador , go fuck yourself !"
13545,russian guy banging his spoons : didnt you hear what i said !! world : same guy who said nazis run ukraine ?
13546,it really does not help when you go north korea with the nuclear threats and say them twice a week if not more . that particular threat has diminishing returns i'm afraid .
13547,"this very much has the "" is she looking over at me "" energy ."
13548,"when you threaten nuclear war every single time things dont go your way , it starts to lose its significance . i wonder if russian schoolchildren are taught about the fable of the boy who cried wolf ."
13549,why should they ? russia has lied about everything else .
13550,putins shaky ass hand wont be able to push the button ..
13551,you won't hear a nuclear threat from nato . because nato is serious about responding to nuclear attack .
13552,it's also why there's nato to be perfectly honest .
13553,"the former guy ( previous us president ) threatened nuclear war multiple times , including against north korea , iran , russia , and hurricanes . the fact that he was a total clown and narcissistic nut job doesn't excuse the fact that he was elected president of the most powerful nato member ."
13554,"the fact that the kremlin isn't a smoldering hole in the ground and putin isn't awaiting trial is nato taking nuclear war seriously . it's literally the one thing russia has , and they're making it look like a joke to the general public in much the same way they've made their entire army look like a joke ."
13555,"exactly . and if they decide to play ball , the us has the exact same weapons"
13556,"russia should be glad that nato isn't taking the nuclear war threat seriously . because if they were , the obvious response is a first strike . there's no other option with dealing with a nation that says they're prepared to use nuclear weapons offensively to acquire territory , because as you mentioned , it never ends . that's why mad basically means that any use of nuclear weapons necessarily escalates to mutually assured destruction , because the other option is complete global capitulation to whichever madman is truly willing to push the button ( or at least , convince others that they are )."
13557,"the way people shut down nonaggressive conversations around here with "" you just want nuclear war !"", you'd think the bombs were already flying ."
13558,exactly . that's why you don't let terrorists blackmail you . they will do it again .
13559,plus its fairly difficult to be alarmed after watching the great russian war machine flounder with their under armed neighbors i completely agree with others that the money that was supposed to be used to maintain their weapon systems is long gone and none of it went to weapons maintenance
13560,"russia , stop trying to make fetch happen . its not going to happen ."
13561,maybe russia forgot about mutually assured destruction
13562,"this is the most important thing about putin . people often compare his moves to playing chess , but putin doesn't play chess ; he plays poker . he raises the stakes to the point where everyone else folds or takes a huge risk staying in the game ."
13563,"this is exactly it . we want our way , nukes ! sorry , we dont believe your bs anymore ."
13564,"neither do i , but that's the world we live in . i don't think it will happen , but if it does , i hope i just get evaporated ."
13565,i dont want to live in a world where everyone concedes to putin every time he brings out the nuke card .
13566,"you guys , im being super cereal right now! edit : * cereal . for posterity ."
13567,not many toys left in the crib to throw out .
13568,"i'm having some me time , russia's attention quota has been exhausted for the entire year . grow beets ."
13569,nope .. just not taking russia seriously .. i mean .. why would we at this point
13570,just play along for now .. i'm sure that they'll get it one day .
13571,"they can nuke nato which will just result in a strike on russia and perhaps total annihilation if it escalates . they can nuke ukraine which might not , but why ? in putin's mind nuking ukraine is nuking a russian province . and even if he doesn't care , where could you drop a nuke that would end the war ? * maybe * ukraine would surrender , but they would never integrate and you would have a permanent * highly motivated * insurgency and in the more likely scenario that they don't surrender , what do you do then ? keep nuking them until it's a wasteland and the world is in a nuclear winter ? there is just no credible reason putin would do it besides being suicidal or insane , which maybe he is , but there's nothing we can do about that anyway so why change natos strategy ?"
13572,""" we demand to be taken seriously ."""
13573,lmao . yes they really are .
13574,"and nato spent literally * decades * not blinking when the soviets threatened nuclear war theres no reason to start now . likethats the whole point of mad ; its the highest stakes mexican standoff ever , and it only stays that way so long as no one blinks ."
13575,"yeah , i don't think russia is taking the threat of nuclear war seriously . we have them too , you know ..."
13576,"that's the thing , the choice isn't handing over ukraine vs possible nuclear war ... if you have over ukraine we're having the exact same conversation with georgia , moldova , and for all we know maybe eventually bulgaria , the former yugoslav countries , poland , ..."
13577,"right . if we show them to do whatever they want every time they say "" nuke "", we might as well just dissolve our government and ask them to rule us . this can't be allowed to work ."
13578,"its what germany did in the 1940s . threaten war and make deals to say if you get what you want , you wont attack certain countries . once they get what they want , rinse and repeat . russias just using the same tactics and thankfully it seems the world has learned ."
13579,and i'm sure we can all imagine the hissy fit put-put would throw if the us threatened to use nukes the same way he has .
13580,"> you know they'd never stop if they got away with it . yep , and _this_ is them not getting away with it . now they're throwing their toys out the pram and realising there's nobody left to pick them back up . russia is halfway off a precipice , it's choices are : - throw itself off ; forever kill off all commerce it built with the west and accept life as a crumbling dictatorship whose major bargaining chip of oil/gas is being weaned away from at lightning speed - claw its way back ; kick out those in charge and make major reparations to buy back faith and spend the last few decades of their fossil fuel riches building back infrastructure and commerce"
13581,"i personally couldn't care less about russia's nukes after the past few years we've had , and i suspect a lot of people feel the same . if they want to ignite mutually assured destruction , they can fucking go for it . they don't need an excuse to do it because there won't be anyone left who cares . but stop talking about it already . you can only make the same threat so many times until people stop listening ."
13582,the issue with them and other nuclear countries is that not all of them believe in mad - they fully expect that tactical nuclear strikes would be acceptable .
13583,"people aren't listening to the rising doomsday cult in the russian orthodox church who believes a nuclear war is essential so that russia can rebuild to where it is faster than the "" decadent west "" can rebuild to where it is . they are literally sprinkling holy water on icmbs and telling their population to expect the end of days . people pretend only america is over run with q-nutballs but russia has their own version . its all fun and games until a guy in a buffalo headdress nearly succeeds in overturning a nearly 250 year old democracy ."
13584,"i think these threats will have a long , lasting effect . russia has likely made themselves a global pariah a bit like nk and will make their denuclearization a top priority for much of the western world ."
13585,no one cares what that baby raping country has to say . they've completely fucked themselves for the next few decades . europe will move away from their oil and gas asap . eu finally knows that they can't rely on russia for their energy . russia will only use it as a weapon again .
13586,"except for the four years of the orange turd , right ? he spewed on about nukes all the time ."
13587,"let's be real : there have been nukes pointed at moscow ( and basically every other russian city ) from the moment we developed missiles that could carry them that far . every major russian city has nukes pointed at it , and every major us city has nukes pointed at it in turn . like , there is no preparation to be done for nuclear war , the weapons stay ready to fire all the time . and everyone with any sense prays to whatever god will listen that those weapons will rust in their silos and never see the light of day . the only possible preparation would be to attempt to beef up the early-intercept systems . but again , if those aren't already ready to go at the drop of a hat , then i'll pick that hat up and eat it . cold war 2 , electric boogaloo . that's where we are ."
13588,lol yeah . you want the us to take your nuclear threat seriously ? i dont think you do
13589,if russia launched as much as one nuke at any nato nation theyd be wiped off the face of the earth within an hour . so of course nato isnt taking this seriously .
13590,"and europe would be swiss/resettled by them , given their nuclear bunkers have capacity for 100 % of their population , which is crazy . even in 2006 they had 300k private shelters and 5k public shelters . they're like preppers on a national level ."
13591,this is why you don't fucking play with fire .
13592,"not just moscow , every square inch of russiabut also the rest of the world for that matter"
13593,"yeah , serious people with working nukes dont threaten . they act when they choose to act ."
13594,"> mad stops working when one or more players cease acting in a rational manner . well , not if you have [ mineshaft superiority ]("
13595,* 90s sitcom audience laugh *
13596,both ears missing lmao
13597,the * original north korea
13598,new drinking game . take a shot each time a russian threatens nukes
13599,ran out of post-its after the 45746th threat .
13600,"> honestly how can you take it seriously beyond preparing for a counter strike after russia has launched exactly . what russias really whining about is that their threats havent taken the intended effect theyre annoyed that their intimidation threats arent working , because of course everyone can see through the image of strength theyre trying ( and failing ) to project ."
13601,i think his audience is pretty much russian citizens . people in the rest of the world make fun of the ridiculous things putin's regime says because those things are meant for people who are already brainwashed .
13602,not happening . i grew up in the cold war . i refuse to be afraid again or let my children feel the bite of that fear . we are doing the right thing in supporting ukraine to the fullest without initiating direct confrontation . do it or stfu .
13603,"nope , i don't think we are and to be honest russia has come out of this looking like pussies ."
13604,idk where you're from ? but have you met the us ? the only kind of political pressure he'll get here in america is to blow his ass off the map so we can get back to business .
13605,russia's strategic rocket force sucks up all the money of the russian military budget . like 80 % iirc . that's why the grunts have no real fist aid kits . i wouldn't write their nukes off just yet . would all detonate ? probably not .
13606,"russia does have a pretty sophisticated nuclear industry and had a nuclear warhead modernization during the last couple of years , as this [ congressional report ]( elaborates . nuclear maintenance is done by profitable state corporation rosatom . they got a number of excellent scientists still publishing on arxiv frequently . they also construct and maintain nuclear power plants - also outside russia - with no major security incidence since russia was established as a nation . due to the economic setup , the maintenance of their nuclear warheads somewhat "" pays for themselves "" and is not part of the normal military budget . for the hydrogen bombs tritium deuterium gas has be be exchanged regularly since it decays with a half life of around 5 years . [ see this discussion on the nuclear weapons subreddit ]( the congressional report also contains a section where us intelligence has some reason to believe russia isn't fully adhering to the 0 yield test policy when conducting hydrodynamic tests ( tests of warheads with no nuclear or subcritical nuclear components ) based on this information , i conclude that the warheads are the least likely component to fail . the logistics of a full nuclear first strike is [ fairly complex though ]( and it stand to question how well it can be executed by russian strategic forces in practice . strictly spoken , the us and other nuclear armed nation have the same problem since there are no historic precedences for nuclear war and you only know how well it was all planned out after the fact ."
13607,"> all those nukes require maintenance , and it's pretty clear the russian military doesn't have that kind of money not only this , the vast majority of russia's old soviet nukes never made it onto actual rockets of any sort . they're just warheads stored in bunkers . that is the main reason no one is truly worried . the weapons that russia has on hand ready to fire at a moments notice in their subs is nothing to scoff at and is absolutely a big bargaining chip for them . but , they're not large and there's not thousands of them on hand . if they chose to launch what they have , it would do a lot damage but , not "" end of the world "" damage . if they pushed launch on those , the world would respond with 1000x the force within minutes . the only way for russia to truly win a large scale nuclear war is for them to start getting those old warheads out and on vehicles . and , that would absolutely be noticed . those storage sites are well known and watched heavily by satellites . the only thing that would actually scare the rest of the world would be if russia actually started doing this . because it would be a major red flag that russia is actually preparing to attack . so far , the most of i have seen is russia showing off a slbm loaded sub and testing an icbm . both of which are not frightening at all to the developed world . the developed world has had that tech and better for decades ."
13608,"they're struggling with ukraine , and they want to fight ** america ** lol"
13609,do they realize no one gives a flying fuck about russia ?
13610,"even if putin is this stupid , his inner circle probably isnt"
13611,exactly and not just putin . this would set a precedent .
13612,i think the russians saw fit not to put their nukes on the internet
13613,might have thought he was a tough guy when i was at school many many years ago seeing him riding a bear or saying hed kill terrorists in toilets . but im happy i didnt allocate any other thought to him since then because the reality is 200 % different from what memes & all make children believe of him .
13614,"i used to think he was an evil genius , cold calculatingly evil . kinda similar to cheney , who was similarly regarded by people i knew . i still think he's chillingly evil ( he's in the running for the most evil man on earth right now ), but the genius part ? not so much ."
13615,i see your point but you have to factor in the fact that putin lies constantly . about everything .
13616,at that rate they are going they are creating their own existential crisis .
13617,"my best guess is that the us boomers are somewhere in range of moscow , tula , vladovostok and st . petersburg . and the attack subs are in the prop sonar shadow of the russian boomers with armed torpedoes in the tubes ."
13618,"thats why you dont threaten to kill someone . you either kill them or you dont , theres no point wasting time and breath on threats ."
13619,nato doesnt need to make a nuclear threat . speak softly and wield a 30 nation defensive pact that accounts for fifty percent of the planets military spending .
13620,speak softly and carry a big stick 
13621,real gs move in silence
13622,"you dont hear nuclear threats from nato because theyre a defensive alliance . the world largely knows anybody that has nukes will use them in defense , but generally we know people threatening to nuke as an offense is full of shit because that would destroy civilization as we know it ."
13623,"also , despite russias posturing , nato is a defensive pact and thus would never threaten nuclear war"
13624,these threats of using nukes are being used to distract us away from the obvious failures and loss of life of the russian military . it is unheard of in western militaries to lose 10 general's and hundreds of senior officers in just a few months of a concentrated traditional military operation using conventional weapon systems . i am an amateur milirary historian and have never read anything like this happening in all of wwi or wwii . please correct me if i am mistaken .
13625,oh i forgot about nuking hurricanes . how embarrassing
13626,"he even threatened to nuke a hurrricane , still got 70 million votes , i can only hope they gave him a fisher-price "" nuclear football "" to carry around because anything else would have been dangerous ."
13627,"did you see the book thing today that said trump asked his secretary of defense ( mark esper , who wrote the book ) multiple times why he couldn't just bomb the drug and cartel locations in mexico . and was convinced mexico wouldn't know they were the ones who did it . what a fucking crazy 4 years . i doubt even an old fashioned slapstick comedy adaptation could do it justice ."
13628,dont insult clowns like that . use * ass*clown instead .
13629,> the us has the exact same weapons i would say the us ones are in much better condition .
13630,"thats the thing ? the headlines could read russia threatens everyone , including itself "
13631,"one of the fundamental differences between our icbms is that ours are considerably more accurate while theirs are generally more destructive . it's not because we couldn't make ours blow up bigger , it's because hitting our actual targets is more important in the end for several reasons , so it's more cost effective"
13632,i give you trident ! and we have 14 subs like this ..
13633,"so does france and the uk , two other nato members"
13634,does russia know it only has three cities to start out with ?
13635,"yeah , since we didn't immediately abandon ukraine , the west is "" not taking the threat seriously ""."
13636,"ahh yes , i am comforted to know that billions of people will die and not just millions ."
13637,"the delusion here seems to be that a "" first strike "" could somehow prevent them from launching their nukes ... that's wrong . so this "" obvious response "" would literally trigger the destruction of human civilization . that is how it works , reddit . it is not possible to preemptively strike in order to remove russia's nuclear option . humanity can be compared to two people with suicide vests ( complete with deadman triggers ) handcuffed to each other . in order to live , both have to come to an agreement to mutually stand down . only then can the vests be removed and the danger eliminated ."
13638,"unpaid russian trolls or paid chinese trolls wanting the us to capitulate under russian first strike , of course ."
13639,honestly this . just getting vapourised due to a bomb will be a much much much easier way to go than dying of radiation poisoning . that shit is not okay .
13640,""" manbearpig is coming !"" "" half man , half bear , half pig ; manbearpig ."""
13641,well what's left is nukes . and nobody expects them to actually throw those ...
13642,there was no reason to even start this war . everyone with an ounce of common sense knew it was a bad idea . and yet . now he has no good way out . everything is possible . it is way more dangerous now then during cuban crisis .
13643,"well if the chernobyl tv show was accurate if the ukraine was nuked by russia in retaliation they could blow up all the containment efforts around chernobyl and do serious damage to themselves , northern europe and russia . fortunately for everyone ukraine isn't behaving like a suicidal spoiled child even under all the pressure being put on them ."
13644,"right ; they're the ones cavalierly threatening nuclear war then going , "" don't you understand how serious this would be if i did it ?"""
13645,it always goes back to poland
13646,"one scary thing with nukes is that we presume everyone is a rational actor , that not even kim jong un would really launch a nuke , and risk their regime . we can't expect putin to act rationally on nuclear war when he has shown he is willing to destroy his entire country just to save face ."
13647,"nonchristians have no concept for how truly batshit fundamentalists are , or how prevalent they are . nonchristians are worthless to them , and they will happily usher in the great tribulation so that they may be united with jesus sooner ."

13649,"> its all fun and games until a guy in a buffalo headdress nearly succeeds in overturning a nearly 250 year old democracy . you seriously think those pissants * actually * almost overthrew the government ? they almost caused some serious shit if they had started executing people , but that doesn't topple the entire country . they army just would have gone in and killed them all . believe it or not we * do * actually have more people enlisted in our armed forces than were at that trump rally ."
13650,"could have told you that a decade ago , but money talks apparently"
13651,"much of other nations failure to predict americas actions stems from misunderstanding our fear process . we are not a fearless people . we are , in fact , somewhat afraid of a great many things all the time . scaring america(ns ) is comparatively easy . whats * hard * is consuming enough of the limited fear pie that our widely scattered attention focuses on * you *, instead of the 100 other things we were worrying-but-not-doing-anything about . if you * do * clear that hurdle , and manage to convince us that you are actually scary , the problem youll run into is that our overwhelming instinct is to ** exterminate boom boom ** the problem . in fact , internally even suggesting a different course of action will be viewed as quasi-treasonous . we are anxious grimdark superman ."
13652,"here's a tip . if you're struggling with ukraine , you don't want to go get to head with the us military ."
13653,"no , nato will be taking it seriously . they will have multiple response options dusted off and laid out ready to execute . they're just not going to flinch or escalate the rhetoric ."
13654,"the thing is though with the nukes is that it will be much more than russia that gets destroyed . the nuclear fallout alone would spread so wide and rapid , especially since many , many nukes would be deployed across the globe i really don't think much of anyone would be safe/survive . it would possibly be a global extinction event ."
13655,"i mean , theyve basically had a national defense policy of being preppers for about a century at this point ."
13656,"does america/canada have bunkers ? i tried searching but google is very vague on this information , i understand thats probably for good reason ."
13657,switzerlake achievement incoming
13658,"i've red they actually have more than 100 % capacity , more like 120 % or something , for additional people fleeing/relatives etc ."
13659,"finland is also pretty bunkered up . just look up the underground city of helsinki a few other countries in europe are bunkered up as well , i meant we all did experience ww2 . in anycase , i think most modern nukes are also built to bust bunkers . so \* shrugs \*"

13667,"its kinda too late for a lot of us , i for one am already feeling that fear and have been ever since this stupid fucking war began and on social media and shit its easy to tell that a lot of people around my age group are scared , and for good reason , since we've never lived through tensions like this before"
13668,"this completely . coupled with the fact that things in the u.s . continue to get worse and worse for the average citizen . lower pay , longer hours , no healthcare , especially no mental healthcare , school shootings , maga's attempted coup and now the repeal of roe v . wade ... fuck man , nuclear war sounds like a fucking respite ."
13669,"every time i see these threats i have a flash of a mental image of a globe with a russia-shaped hole cut out of it . i don't want end of days for us all , but if they gonna force it i've no qualms with their fate"
13670,"while i do believe the nukes probably work , they are also the most likely thing that suffers from corruption . nukes will 99 % of the time never be used . nobody actually will use them or test them in their lifetime . it's probably the easist thing to cut corners on and get away with it . people involved with it can think that by the time they get caught it's nuclear war and it doesnt matter anyway ."
13671,"a significant part of the russian nuclear deterrence force is paid from rosatom which also does their civilian nuclear work including exports . since its is effectively self-funded , it is likely significantly more reliable than the actual military . rosatom is basically the usa doe , if it also sold nuclear reactors , fuel , and vendor services on the side ."
13672,"> rosatom which is run by alexey likhachev , previous deputy chairman of the committee for economic policy . seeing how deep the corruption runs regarding economic policy in russia , the health of the warhead stockpile is rightfully in question , internationally . especially with the claims that the maintenance ' pays for itself '. i am sure it does , likhachev . i am sure it does ."
13673,i'm willing to say the nukes work but can't make it to orbit let alone target . i feel like the simple shit like not enough wd40 would be the most neglected not warheads
13674,"great info drop , thanks !"
13675,the us spends 10 million dollars per nuke per year for maintenance . i dont think russia does that

13686,why nuke them when you can just draw on a map with a sharpie and they go in a different direction ?
13687,id have confidence they work perfectly . the russian ones .... i feel confident a great deal of the money sent to maintain them was spent on vodka and hookers after every set of hands that touched it .
13688,"not only that , but the us nuclear system is effectively a first strike system . i think the russians know that too . so once they let the nuclear genie out of the bottle , they face the prospect of taking disproportionate losses in a general exchange . this is why they spend as much time talking about poseidon ( the big slow nuclear torpedo designed to blow up in us harbors ) and dead hand ( a doomsday system that automatically launches icbms if the russian government is decapitated )."
13689,"well considering i heard recently that the failure rate of russian munitions could be as high as 60 %, i would agree ."
13690,"i mean more than likely russia has several in good condition , and unlike an army it only takes one nuke to create a travesty"
13691,better to assume the russian nukes work perfectly than to take that gambit . also most of their funding goes to their rocket/missile tech .
13692,"according to the us russias nukes work . as they are allowed to inspect each others nukes . if russia really did not have working nukes , the us would have obliterated them by now . instead we are here ."
13693,"yes , but i worry who russia would nuke . theres no winning in a nuclear war , so why not do the most damage you can ? nuking leadership would be more effective for finishing a war , but nuking a populace is demoralizing . and its not like they dont have 4000 . even if only a hundredth worked , 40 1 + megaton nukes landing on civilians would be horrifying ."
13694,it threatened itself in its confusion !
13695,""" russia not taking counterattack seriously """
13696,and a decapitating strike is a decapitating strike whether its done with 3mt or 30mt . similar to how 30 weapons is more than enough if 20 is all thats required for deterrence . the cold war buildup was more about dick measuring and spending the soviets into oblivion than it was establishing a practical nuclear arsenal .
13697,"well , those two go kind of hand in hand . inaccurate icbms aren't more destructive just to be more destructive , it's because you still want to kill your target , and it takes a much bigger boom to kill something like a bunker or an icbm silo if you're only pretty sure you'll land within a kilometer or so than it takes if you can basically drop it within a hundred meters . plus , if you are sure you have the accuracy to downsize , you can then put more warheads on the same size missile , and that actually causes more destruction overall than a single big boom does ."
13698,"when does it end though ? if they are threatening nukes over ukraine , you think they'll stop threatening there ? no . they'll keep going and going and going until it comes to a head once again . so it's either stand up to them and call their bluff , or just let them needlessly slaughter millions , starve / strangle all of europe and eventually arrive at the same point after all that . don't get me wrong , it's terrifying , but it's a fact of the world we live in and mad ."
13699,its very unlikely that a us first strike could completely eliminate the russian second strike but a us first strike would very significantly reduce the number of warheads the russians could fire compared with a russian first strike . so if you believe the russians are about to launch a first strike then the rational response is to strike them first . at the next level if the russians believe the us believes that the russians are about to first strike ( whether the russians intended to or not ) then its rational for the russians to first strike the us . and so on . this is why russia talking up nuclear war is dangerous .

13829,"only if others are there to see me afterwards , because if i have time and the necessary presence of mind , im gonna raise both middle fingers in the air before im incinerated ."
13830,"that's where you should get a security clearance first , and ask the guards nicely to swim on the cooling pool . but generally , people who gets a security clearance to the reactor tends not to be people who would have an idea to swim in the cooling pool in the first place ."

13832,"in the uk , we drive for 3 hours and the accent has changed twice and bread rolls have a new name ."
13833,yeah i can drive over 9 hours and not be across my state .. and i dont even live in a state that most people consider that large when they think of large states ( oregon )
13834,la to new york ( 2451 mi ) is almost the same distance that lisbon is from moscow ( 2427 mi ).
13835,"i live in canada and i didn't know how relatively small europe is . for example , i remembered looking at italy and going "" wow , rome and venice are far away from each other ."" but then i took the train from one to another and it was like ... 1.5 hours ?"
13836,"my brother was stationed in el paso for a while and the company i had worked for at a time had a flight to dallas that i could have gone on . i figured , i'll already be i'm texas i could totally drive over and visit . turned out that the drive from dallas to el paso is over 8 hours . definitely didn't do it lol"
13837,"the entirety of switzerland can fit into lake michigan , where i go to swim ."
13838,its the classic joke : in europe 200 years is a short time and 200 miles is a long distance . in the us 200 years is a long time and 200 miles is a short distance .
13839,"no . the lucky ones cast concrete shadows . ninety nine percent survive the exchange , only to drink water from a poisoned well and eat food dusted with fallout . the unfortunate die agonizing deaths of radiation poisoning . the truly cursed die agonizing deaths from cancer . the worst thing about nuclear war is living ."
13840,"many fallout shelters were big , solid government buildings ( mostly still in use as offices ) in the middle of cities with huge basements . also , lots of caves/caverns were fallout shelters , stocked with a few weeks worth of clean water and rations . and by "" rations "", i'm using that term liberally . visited rickwood caverns in alabama a couple weeks ago , which in the sixties was stocked with enough purified water , aspirin and lemon drops to last several thousand people for about three weeks . if you visit grand canyon caverns , you can still see the pallets of powdered food and emergency rations dropped off about six decades ago , never used ."
13841,"yes , [ it currently does ]( - although on site inspections are paused for now due to the pandemic ."
13842,rorys delivery was just perfect in that scene . hes had to suffer dickheads like the tickler his entire life and hes 300 % done with it .
13843,"and thats the scope of the crime that was committed upon that series . i used to watch that scene on youtube all the time , absolutely perfect from start to finish . i havent been able to watch it since the series finished because all i can think about is how it all ended , and i cant even enjoy watching the hound eating every chicken in that room ."
13844,if we could put him and lavrov and putin in a room ... that would be fun to watch
13845,he lives on in all of us . rest in peace chris you were the best ever
13846,reference went right over these folks heads
13847,i just read this interaction like two reporters talking to each other on the evening news .
13848,the hookers had money for their children so thats a net good 
13849,"civilization saved by russian hookers and cheap vodka , more after the break ."
13850,when do they not
13851,"vodcoke i dunno , maybe it's a thing . i don't know anything about drugs ."
13852,when your secretary of defense is named a pimp named slickback 
13853,if we ever find out then money wont matter anymore .
13854,the delivery system is a lot easier to maintain than the physics package . some of the more exotic materials need replacement every 10 years or else they wont fire . i doubt either side is allowed to disassemble and get core samples . aa dirty bomb or low yield nuke is still no joke but i doubt the majority of their weapons will work as designed . the window for a proper detonation is tiny .
13855,i think it's probably fair to assume that neither country is actually fully abiding by the terms of the inspection deal .
13856,"eh , dig deeper and you'll find that far less information is obtained from inspections . for instance , out of the 18 allowable annual inspections , an inspection may be used to count the number of weapons aboard a single bomber , or to count the number of reentry vehicles aboard a single icbm . inspections have nothing to do with the efficacy of the arms . some telemetry information is shared regarding performance , but that's self-reported , like most of the data that's shared ."
13857,spy's also enjoy hookers and blow .

13862,rule number 1 of owning weapons that could annihilate civilization : dont make it automated
13863,well given the russian troops flying the soviet flag in ukraine its safe to assume putin wants to rebuild the ussr empire .
13864,it would shock me if they didn't keep some form of bioweapon program going . it's a super cost effective method of killing people and theyre poor as fuck . now delivery is another thing . it's shown to be the hardest part of bio weapons usage and as we can see they are not very technically proficient . so who knows ? 
13865,yeah but that's metric .
13866,russia has 6k nukes . if 60 % are duds the remaining 40 % can still kill the world 2.4 times over again .
13867,"i actually gained a ton of respect for them for not just apologizing , but making an entire episode about how stupid they were , about how right al gore was , and about how real the threat still is . i mean there's "" mea culpa "" and then there's "" let me publish an essay on how you were right and i was wrong ."""
13868,"no , that's the other one . he's thinking of the guy in the radar station that identified a flock of birds as a handful of icbms and rejected the counterstrike on the grounds that "" no way does an american first strike look like that . they'd launch way more "". can't remember his name , though ..."

13874,"i toured on buses working for bands my first 7 years out of high school , and occasionally got stuck driving the equipment trucks as well . i came to think of us as pirates and the towns we went to as islands separated by vast amounts of sea . the trucks and busses were our ships . 18 wheelers travelled in groups and were pods of whales . there were times at night where you wouldn't see another vehicle for a 100 mile stretch , and it was just dark and eerie and seemed like you had accidentally driven off the earth into an endless void . the national speed limit back then was 55mph . you could drive an entire day and still be in texas . that said , the most nothing i ever experienced was doing winter tours in canada in the winter where everything was unbroken snow as far as the eye could see , and the population centers were 200 miles apart . it seemed like they just forgot to render reality ."

13884,from russia with the love bone
13885,"unless we find out that both sides squandered it all and none of them work , in which case things will be very awkward ."

13891,that or the russian empire .
13892,"i honestly just threw that bit in there for anyone trying to argue "" it's not the soviet union "" etc . because of course that kgb fucking rotten piece of shit wants his empire back ."
13893,its unlikely theyd get much more than one launch off - so its more like 40 % of 1100 or so which is the ready number . how many is that ? still . too . damn . many . which is why nato has very pointedly avoided sending its own conventional forces into the ukraine . thats us taking the nuclear war threat very seriously . russia almost certainly understands this too and its hopefully just their usual over the top rhetoric and howling in outrage at everything they dont like . of course the trouble with their reputation for being so over the top all the time is that its possible they might be in dead earnest one time and nobody else realises it and brushes it off . the boy who cried wolf except this time the stakes are nuclear armageddon .
13894,they had no need to do it but they not only did it but did it in an entertaining way that hammered home their mistake . you're allowed to be wrong as long as you're willing to grow . i don't mind people saying or doing the wrong thing if they don't double down and ignore when they make a mistake . owning up to your mistake and making amends is very healthy .
13895,i remember going through the southern side of the gaspesie peninsula and seeing fire hydrants painted like disney characters . are you speaking of somewhere close to new carlisle or are the disney hydrants a more widespread thing than i thought ?
13896,in minnesota knitted poof-ball hats have begun appearing on our fire hydrants for some reason .

13925,"you fired missiles at a port that had grain shipments , you fucking sausage"
13926,russia ? deflecting blame ? impossible .
13927,"ofc . when has russia taken responsibility for anything ? russia has been reduced to a pure shithole , and will stay that way for the forseable future ."

13933,""" look at what you made me do !"" they really do think the world is as stupid as them ."
13934,"and africans will believe him because blaming the west for absolutely everything is quite popular there . also , russia , the only european colonial power which still holds on her colonies , is widely considered "" anti-colonial "" in africa ."

( i'm a bot ) ***** > even before setting out on his four-country tour , foreign minister sergey v . lavrov made clear he would use the trip to blame the west for the grain shortages tied to the war in ukraine that are raising fears of famine in african countries and to paint russia as the continent's faithful ally . > july 24 , 2022 , 10:16 a.m . et.for months , the united states , britain and the european union have tried to turn the argument in their favor by laying the responsibility for the soaring price of bread and other basic foods squarely at mr . putin's feet , roundly condemning russia for shutting down the flow of ukrainian grain to the world through the black sea.on friday , russia agreed to a deal brokered by the united nations and turkey that would allow ukraine to export its grain . > nearly 30 percent of egypt's tourists came from russia before the war , and russia is building a $ 26 billion nuclear power plant in egypt . ***** [** extended summary **]( | [ faq ]( "" version 2.02 , ~ 661159 tl;drs so far ."") | [ feedback ]( "" pm's and comments are monitored , constructive feedback is welcome ."") | * top * * keywords *: ** russia**^1 ** ukraine**^2 ** african**^3 ** grain**^4 ** putin**^5"
13936,russia is just continuing to dig itself a hole . pretty soon they gonna depose russia
13937,what i hate about this is that african diplomats will likely side with russia and blame the west .
13938,im sorry fucking tired of listening to russian bullshit . i wish nato could just do a massive air campaign against russia .. those damn nukes
13939,of course it's the west's fault . if russia was only able to conquer ukraine quickly it would then free up the ports .
13940,maybe they should just forcefully take the farms from their owners to improve their food production
13941,"the "" golden billion "" seems to be a very appropriate word that i will use from now on ."
13942,"that's not surprising , "" no u "" argument is pretty much 90 % of their diplomatic policy , with the rest being threats ."
13943,so what happens if the west starts exporting food the africa ? and why tf isn't africa growing food .
13944,"lavrov is a fake , lying rat ."
13945,bla bla bla nato bla bla bla west bla bla bla bla bla bla i must suckup to putin bla bla bla
13946,what does the west do to counter that russian trolls bullshit and propaganda as we seem to be losing face around the world despite russia being the dipshit
13947,"unpopular opinion : given the troubled history africa has with the west , it will ( and mostly always has ) eaten up any and all propaganda and news provided by other , non-west countries , such as russia . no matter how much counter-evidence you provide , africa has and will probably never forgive the west for what it has done to the continent . the good news is : the west's reputation is already pretty bad , so having russia bullshitting them up even more against the west isn't gonna cause any more troubles and distrust than there were already present to begin with ."
13948,why is this article not labeled as an op-ed when it clearly is one ? nyt sucks these days
13949,"they made a deal , what was the condition of not fulfilling it , nothing ?"
13950,"makes sense . if the west and ukraine had just rolled over like russia planned , none of this would be happening . / s"
13951,"it would be nice to have his words translated instead of summarized . we deserve a free press that treats us as the intelligent beings we are , not ones to be led by the ear or nose .... that brand of journalism is nonexistent in the usa for all practical purposes and quick hits with snappy snippy headlines oversaturates our environment with rumor , innuendo and go get em ' with everything you've got , for us , orders in place .... disappointing at an extreme level ... incompetent war protagonist strategy ( maybe there's a bit of exaggeration there , they've come pretty far with it )"
13952,"africans :"" yeah , he is right , long live russia and long live putin """
13953,yes and this was their plan . they knew a lot of african nations needed that food and would believe anything russia said over anything that came from ' the west '. now they're trying to get african nations to join them or at least raise enough hell to distract or delay nato and the un from getting further involved .
13954,and iirc they got some parts of sanctions lifted for the deal they broke less than 24 hours after .
13955,"few reasons . first , to get support ( e.g . in the un ) from those poor countries in exchange for the promise of "" helping resolve the issue , or else "". second , to persuade them to not follow any anti-russian sanctions or help europe reduce their side effects . third , to boost the next migrant crisis to keep europe busy ."
13956,"what is likely going to happen is that the african leaders are going to do whatever to take to secure food for their people . what it entails is up in the air . it could mean they accept russia's bs , kiss putin's ass in exchange for "" generous gifts "" of grain , get china more involved since china has a lot of investments , get the west to help out , strike deals with whoever ."
13957,just like in indonesia . sometimes i'm ashamed of being indonesian .
13958,"i mean given their relatively recent history with western powers , it is a wonder that they aren't more pissed at former western empires . there is possibly a generation ( though extremely old ) alive when they were released from the yokes of colonialism . but not all of africa is monolithic though and some might break away and change faster than others ."
13959,i mean if you historically look at what europeans did to africa you would probably hold those beliefs as well . you are acting like africa doesnt trust the west just because they dont feel like it .
13960,russia has no colonies . what are you talking about ?
13961,gonna depose russia with africa falling right into china's hands . putin thought he was the puppeteer . didn't notice those gossamer threads on his arms .
13962,"we should just go get and deliver the grain . our fault ? then we can fix it , right ?"
13963,"i wonder if it is a tougher job for labrov to convince nations outside of russia , china , egypt ( tightly controlled internet access ) of their bullshit ."
13964,if they buy into this bullshit and blame the west they are gonna starve for sure because it's not up to west to decide if grain will be exported or not . only chance africa has is to put a pressure on russia because they are the only reason why ukraine can't export grain .
13965,"sure , attack the paper , since you have nothing of substance to say"
13966,there are browsers with built-in translation
13967,ignorant take .
13968,i wasn't aware that ukraine's grain exports were being sanctioned .
13969,"the trade sanctions are against russia , not ukraine . the grain is stopped by russia blockading ukraine's ports . ( and possibly laying mines in their approaches )."
13970,sanctions didn't cause the blocking and strealing of the world's grain reserves . the war of aggression did
13971,"africans : "" he who feeds us . praise our straight ** white ** male ** lord ** and saviour !"""
13972,"the african leaders aren't as naive as you seem to think . most of them understand perfectly well what's going on , but they'll do what they have to to get enough food supplies ."
13973,"the only problem with that is the west doesn't rely on africa for anything important . and any uprising in africa will no effect america , or the uk . makes me wonder what the real play is"
13974,why would the african nations believe russia over the west ?
13975,african nations have no capacity to delay the further involvement of nato in anything . the un cant do anything because russia is on the security council .
13976,"fourth , to recruit "" volunteers "" to join the fight on russia's side ."
13977,"for the third , we simply do not help them , rubber bullets , repelling boats with migrants or direct transfer to the combat zones of ukraine , maybe even pushing them to the borders of belarus , they will not feel sorry for them there . if they believe we are evil , let's not spoil our image in front of them . edited : and if we are going to play dirty , we stop medical aid for the countries that will start supporting plutheristan at least in the un , and we find an excuse for infections / which are there anyway / to not allow them ."
13978,"yeah , they are doing this in many countries . a shame ."
13979,europeans and arabs did incredible things to africans but please what is wrong with africans who fail to empathize with north asian peoples who suffered a very similar fate ?
13980,entire north asia . what business do you think a european nation has on the pacific coast ? hundreds of nomadic shamanic/animist herder nations who never asked to be colonized by europeans .
13981,i would love to see russia shit them selves when a carrier strike group is escorting a bunch of transport ships .
13982,given that the troll farms of russia are exported now to africa and south america and you can visibly see that in their comments i think its super easy to convince the people if not the government
13983,"they'll starve or they will do the thing russia is actually trying to provoke : mass emigration to europe . that way , he's gonna kill two birds with one stone : 1 . cause more massive troubles for europe to deal with and hence bringing up more people against their governments to stop the sanctions and stay out of the war 2 . have africans worry more about their survival instead of believing that russia is the bad guy and wasting their time to deal with politics ."
13984,there are russian propaganda bullshit outlets such as rt or sputnik which will happily explain you why the west is to blame for everything .
13985,"the things actually said by representation of the speeches made blaming the west ( usa ) with text of said speeches . we've not seen that present in this article . even the most accurate translation tool would need to have something to translate from and to .... so though i accept those tools exist , we've not been benefited by them because the news organization responsible for outputting this particular piece of journalism failed to provide details to support the accusations of blame it created for the readership to take away from the article as fact .... terrible quality reporting and inflammatory hate mongering for the readership to carry along as facts after reading . it should receive something different in return for the thank you note expected .... you can't fix what you can't identify ... this is entirely fixable"
13986,"africans :"" we hate the western countries so much that we will risk our lives trying to live there """
13987,"yeah i would think they can see through russia's game . russia started a war and destroyed the ports , and then refused to honor their ceasefire/safe corridor agreements ."
13988,the leaders may get it but dont be so sure their voters do . the russian disinformation campaign is in full swing pretty much everywhere you look .
13989,pretext to pull china to do something because of all their investments in africa through belt and road .
13990,creating famine and thus migration . wanna guess where the africans would go ?
13991,yep . most of africa is already in chinas pocketindebted for generations
13992,because past colonialism .
13993,"what bothers me the most is my people saying that us invasion to iraq and afghanistan were evil , while claiming that russian invasion against ukraine is russians trying to balance the world dominated by the evil west . such a double standard . at least us never intended to annex iraq and afghanistan ."
13994,what does north asia have to do with any of this ? im talking about what europeans did to africa and the lasting effect it still has on the continent to this day .
13995,"i know , everyone is biased against russia today , but can't you just use a common sense ? should canadians and americans give up their lands to indian tribes and leave ? if yes , where when and how ? should australia and new zealand do the same ? 100s other countries exist on "" colonized "" ( from your logic ) territories . what about them ?"
13996,i was actually thinking about this yesterday .
13997,i didn't think about that . it could swing either way as a help to the west or a hinder
13998,until africa decides that it's not indebted . who knows .
13999,"ok i get it for europe , but the us didn't have them as colonies . i would think it's pretty obvious that russia is playing them like a violin , from the facts alone . surely the leaders must be canny enough to realize ."
14000,because that would mean giving iraqis and afghanis us citizenship . i.e . its not a positive retort you're mentioning .
14001,look at it this way . russia is already struggling in ukraine when realistically the only support their primary adversaries are giving is secondhand equipment and money . if the war escalates any more to the point of volunteers being sent in then russia's only chance at holding off is for china to do something that would require a military response to make a standoff even if no direct military action occurs . ie deploy their new carriers to the south china sea to disrupt freedom of navigation missions and try to restrict trade moving through the region . the idea is to make that escalation too risky for nato to respond too .
14002,"china has only one "" new carrier "" - the other 2 were deployed in 2012 and 2019 . and if they try do disrupt the trade in the area , the three usa carriers will intervene - and trade disruption will affect china the most , as they import raw materials and oil in huge amounts by sea ... ruzzia is being slowly fucked , and china will not risk being implicated - instead they'll watch from the sides , and make ruzzia their vassal in the end ..."
14003,china isnt going to do shit but then neither is anyone else . ukraine isnt going to get any help beyond weapons and intelligence .
14004,russia is a sinking ship that china has zero interest getting dragged down with . what china * will * do is * exploit * russia for all it's worth during its shit eating clown show
14005,an aspiring empire built on slavery . just what 2022 needed .
14006,"i can see the recruitment posters now "" join the army today , this is not a suggestion . we will hunt you down ! """
14007,"if they conscript these men , can't the men simply surrender once sent to fight and be captured by the ukrainians ? i am asking out of ignorance as to how this works ."

14009,they should have joined the ukrainian army when the war started instead of sitting back and expecting russia to roll into kiev . now they can get conscript wages and underfed while they serve as cannon fodder for the russian regulars and wagner group . they chose poorly .
14010,separatists ; you mean those fucking brainless goons who were transported to the regions to displace ukrainians and pretend to declare an autonomy just so russia could invade ? yeah fuck them all i hope every one of those pricks gets arrested after the war and either sent back to the motherland or to prison . or just dies in the war .
14011,"get fucked , traitors ."
14012,"good job guys , you broke russia . this is payback for brexit"
14013,"hmmm , why does one of those guys in the video have a confederate flag on the back of his t-shirt ."
14014,"can we stop saying "" pro-russian separatist "" and call them russians since we all know thats what they are . they're never was "" pro russian separatist "" just russians pretending to be ."
14015,\* rabid dogs
14016,thats not fair to the cats . even stray cats are useful as they catch and kill rats . pro separatists are the rats .
14017,"i don't think this is a good way of solving your attrition problem . at some point there has to be a critical mass of guys on the ground who don't want to take orders from the higher ups , doesn't there ?"
14018,how is qatari wc an empire ??
14019,"in ww1 & 2 , officers carried pistols . pistols are mostly useless at long range . they were used to shoot any soldiers that disobeyed orders to fight . i imagine there is a similar situation going on here . and that it would be hard to be clearly seen surrendering in the middle of a fire fight ."
14020,"they are basically locked inside an armored vehicle . the commander , gunner and driver are regular army while the dismounts in the back have no control . i was a bradley gunner and my dismounts were just along for the ride until we dropped ramp . then they would be standing next to a giant gun and other very large guns so surrender would be a crazy and potentially deadly option , you're going home in a body bag no matter what so you may as well fight ."
14021,"maybe they didn't want to fight at all , and wanted to avoid the whole bloody mess ?"
14022,"lol the fucking arrogance of this post , like you picked the wrong team on battlefield . nlt everyone is a fighter and maybe thought they could avoid all of it"
14023,"to be fair , there are also notmal people caught on that side of front . and given that everything started 8 years ago then guys who are 18 yo now were only 10 at that moment ."
14024,donbass has a right to self-determination up to independence from ukraine . all peoples have the right to self-determination . without this right democracy has no meaning .
14025,and trump !
14026,"it's the [ novorossiya ("" new russia "") flag ]( - the russian-occupied areas of donetsk and luhansk in ukraine ."
14027,it says which translates as novorossiya or new russia [
14028,pro russia idiots are just like our southern idiots ! they love losing
14029,i was talking about the russian federation .
14030,its called the flag of novorossiya which is ironically supposed to represent russias version of a confederacy .
14031,"i read a story a few months back about a commander having an issue with troops that didn't want to go to ukraine . he pulled out his pistol and began threatening them , only to have a soldier pull the pin on a grenade and say something to the effect of "" shoot me if you're man enough to die as well !"". then the commander put his gun away and walked off in a huff after which the soldier replaced the pin . not sure of the legitimacy of that story , but an amusing story of true and a clever way to counter your superiors with pistols ."
14032,"> they were used to shoot any soldiers that disobeyed orders to fight . they could be used for that , but officers had them mostly for other reasons . one is it's easier to lead people with independent hands . a sword and pistols gives you more body language than a rifle will . another reason is chivalry and , not the fun fake kind . it's the kind that drives you to lead hundreds of men towards the enemy , that way you can get in close and shoot someone . pistols were a continuation of military stratification via equipment ."
14033,"damn , wh40k came in millenia early ."
14034,yeah but the soldiers also have guns so they can just shoot their commander .
14035,ww1 & ww2 has single bolt action guns compared to the ak47
14036,"worst thing is , the article states that theyre forcing ukrainian passport holder , = ukrainians , too . i can only guess that the local russian bastards by now have mastered putting a gun into the back of these ukrainian conscripts and letting them die before any russian soldier gets killed , using them as cannon fodder before using their own soldiers ."
14037,may as well kill the guys that kidnaped you .. if you re gonna die anyway . there a higher chance your group of kidnapped guys can survive the war killing the russians and surrender vs getting killed by the ua .
14038,"imagine avoiding conscription of your country , just to get conscript by the enemy . the article say forced conscription happen since february , and there is a russian blogger reporting from captured city , all young male and female left when the city got captured . they know very well what happen if you stay , not only soldier , but the very expandable kind ."
14039,"not a realistic option when your home is ground zero for a european land war , sorry ."
14040,by moving to russia and not taking half a country with them ..
14041,nice try russian disinformation troll . self determination using a democratic process can be fine . a hostile nation invading and creating a puppet state in conquered territory is not the same .
14042,"the self determination you speak of is fake , its propagated by russia as a reason to invade . if russia succeeds in ukraine they will do the same in other countries"
14043,> a clever way what do you think happened next to that soldier ?
14044,"those are important , but probably more important is the emphasis on that officers should lead and not fight . if your infantry officers are busy shooting at the enemy they are not doing their job . so , you give them pistols for self-defence but no long arms . this changed during the cold war with the introduction of increasingly effective sharpshooters and snipers . now most armies want the officers equipment to mimic those of the common soldiers as much as possible , to make it a bit harder to target them . you have a similar setup in modern armoured forces where command vehicles are designed to mimic combat vehicles while often having reduced firepower ."
14045,where do you think they got all the ideas ??
14046,google tommy gun . mp40 or greasegun
14047,it's a big chance those forcefully drafted guys are handed ammo only on their way to battlefield inside apc
14048,easy to say when you're sitting at home watching nerflix .
14049,and then the russian army works out who you are and murders your whole family to serve as warning for anyone else who wants to try this action .
14050,they've lived in donbass since the russians colonized it . they work the land and the factories . why should they leave ?
14051,he went to a farm and lived happily ever after .
14052,lost the pin ?
14053,they even use the same hats : p
14054,"or the m1 . even more brutal than the ak , as it's a full power battle rifle vs an assault rifle ."
14055,if then .
14056,since they like it soo much and its better than slicing a sovereign country in half .
14057,"ahh , his opponent had [ one white mana available ]("
14058,""" it must have been ukraine's other enemies !"""

14061,""" turkey's defence minister said on saturday ** russian officials had told ankara that moscow had "" nothing to do "" with strikes ** on ukraine's odesa port . the russians told us that they had absolutely nothing to do with this attack , and that ** they were examining the issue very closely and in detail **"" yes , the same russians who "" didn not have anything to do "" with kramatorsk train station , with the kremenchuk shopping mall and the same ones who first agreed to ceasefires for humanitarian corridors then started shooting on civilians ... nice try putin's regime , but you have zero credibility ."
14062,thats one way of saying you dont have your troops under control anymore .
14063,"option a is russia simply lying about the whole thing and now lying again about being innocent . option b is the people brokering the deal and denying the missile strike now , not having read the memo that nothing what they do interests either putin or the military . they are finding out that they are pawns the hard way . option c is the standing orders and a slow command infrastructure causing this . we know of the deal , we get the real news , the troops on the ground do not get news , they got their orders and they carry them out . option d is putin allowing the deal to be brokered but then unintentionally forgetting that standing orders exist that he has to recall . such things happen , if a one man leadership is trying to micromanage an army . one may commend putin on keeping his enemies confused , but if all options reflect equally bad on you , that is not a confusion you want out there . because all options say the same thing , russia are either liars , or dysfunctional , or both , do not make any deals with them ever ."
14064,does anyone actually believe anything russia says ?
14065,"if russia is saying they had nothing to do with it , you can be assured that they were behind it . back in 2000 putin blamed chechen rebels for blowing up apartment buildings in moscow , buynaksk and volgodonsk , when they were carried out by putin and his former kgb/fsb pals to bring putin into power . putin blamed chechen militants for the bombings , but they denied responsibility , along with chechen president aslan maskhadov . investigations showed the bombings had all signs of a kgb/fsb operation and the the bombings did as intended , they pushed putin's popularity way up and he was elected . pretty much anything these people say they aren't responsible for , they are responsible for !"
14066,"clearly , everybody , it was a ukrainian false flag operation . they fired their own missile at themselves from inside russia so they can claim to be victims again ! / s"

14070,"the classic russian mo . trick people into a peace treaty , instantly break it , say someone else did it , ask for a different treaty a short while later . never agree to a cease fire with them just fight hard until they are back in their own country"
14071,"wtf russia ... when we thought the bar couldn't be set any lower , you proved us wrong . and less than 24 hours after signing a treaty , fucking disgraceful . any future treaties with russia is no longer possible , you completely ignore them"

14073,but she caught me on the counter ( it wasn't me ) saw me bangin ' on the sofa ( it wasn't me ) i even had her in the shower ( it wasn't me ) she even caught me on camera ( it wasn't me )
14074,called this shit out yesterday regarding the worth of a russian signature ( its 0 ). i was wrong for giving it 1-2 weeks before a breach but hey at least i got down voted into oblivion by ruble shills .
14075,we're passed absurdity at this point ..
14076,russia's top export is lies
14077,ahh yes it must be the famous ukrainian navy shooting at itself
14078,the eye in the sky never lies . russia forgets they are being watched 24/7 .
14079,"the neighbor to my right has a garden . i buy food from them to feed my family . the neighbor to * their * right beat up my neighbor , and stole the garden , and then told me it's none of my business . i'm feeling a little bit homicidal ."
14080,"forever remember russia is led by a liar with liar subordinates . negotiate , associate your name with russia at your own risk ."
14081,says the lying liars who lie .
14082,"so two days ago the humiliation of putin waiting for erdogan for 45 seconds in front of a camera goes viral . two days later russia breaks an agreement sponsored by turkey , humiliating erdogan . coincidence ?"
14083,"just like washington couldn't tell a lie , russia cannot tell the truth , just like any fascist state or person ."
14084,must be the other russia . fucking idiots think we are all stupid . more lies for domestic propaganda .
14085,"> ukraine itself shot at the port targeting a major source of income for the ukrainian economy ! if you lie , at least make some sense ."
14086,"but at this point you can't trust anything russia says , no matter how big or small . they lie about everything ."
14087,russia = lies . ..... cannot make a deal with evil
14088,"when russia speaks , mostly the opposite is true ."
14089,if the rus deny it - it is definitely true .
14090,"right , and remember when russia said they werent going to invade ukraine ?"
14091,"yeah , just like you werent invading the ukraine "
14092,we'll...well....if russia said it . it's must be gospel...lmfao . 
14093,nothing is confirmed unless moscow denies it .
14094,the russians actually believe we believe this bullshit ?! total cunts !
14095,pretty easy system ; russia denies doing something = they totally did russian say they did something = they didnt russia accuse others of something = what russia did or will do
14096,dj - vu for everyone who had followed 4 wars serbia started in the 1990s .
14097,"just like russia had nothing to do with interference in the 2016 election . i mean , what would be their motivation ? putin is if nothing else , a man of his word ."
14098,russian missiles just happened to be in the area . it was ukrainian nazi aggression that caused them to explode .
14099,i see . it was the other country firing kalibr cruise missiles at ukraine .
14100,pathological
14101,"naughty , little green men ?"
14102,"is never russia , even if we have satellite images that prove 100 % that it came from the russian side and from russian weapons , it's never them . putin can literally kill a guy himself on the street that he would say it wasn't him and blame it on the west , right on the spot and putin bootlickers will believe it ."
14103,"the time for believing anything russia said in good faith is over , they have ruined their reputation worldwide and should not be trusted until the fsb/kgb is gutted"
14104,everything russia says is a lie . full stop .
14105,must feel good for turkey being made an absolute fool by russia . again .
14106,i dont see any reason why it would have been russia djt
14107,russia just lying through their teeth as per usual
14108,"wow . guess it was those "" other russians "". is this like the kid with his hand in the cookie jar getting caught with chocolate all over his face and a who me expression ."
14109,would that be the same russia that says it has nothing to dowith poisoning people it finds an inconvenience !
14110,sure thing russia . and if you pull my right leg it plays jingle bells .
14111,so they wont mind nato popping a few boats over there to take out this surprise mystery third party .
14112,it must be been that other country that is attacking ukraine . this is more about russia keeping its own people in check than it is for anyone else .
14113,these russians are the pinnacle of cringe .
14114,oh ok so where did it come from lmao
14115,"russia just confessed it , german news says . ( 24/7 . 10.03 ) here the german text : kreml rumt angriff auf odessa ein angeblich militrisches ziel 10.03 uhr : das russische auenministerium hat den angriff auf odessa eingerumt . mit hochprzisen raketen sei ein kriegsschiff der ukraine getroffen worden , sagte ministeriumssprecherin maria sacharowa laut der nachrichtenagentur reuters . die nachrichtenagentur afp zitierte sacharowa mit der aussage , russland habe im hafen militrische infrastruktur zerstrt . nach darstellung der ukraine wurden bei der attacke am samstag jedoch hafenanlagen getroffen . russland hatte laut der trkei zunchst seine beteiligung bestritten . die russen haben uns gesagt , dass sie mit diesem angriff nichts zu tun haben und dass sie die angelegenheit sehr genau untersuchen , hatte der trkische verteidigungsminister hulusi akar versichert ."
14116,"they made it nearly 24 hours before breaking their word , a world record . it shows what putin thinks of the un , turkey , and certainly ukraine . i wonder what he is going to do if ukraine counter offensives really pick up steam ."
14117,so who did it ? i'm confused .
14118,""" we are not there ."" "" that wasn't us "". russia is so weak they even can't take responsibility for things they do . it definitely , has to disappear on a political map ."
14119,says it while standing next to the smouldering hot empty rocket launcher .
14120,sure ... it was the war fairy .
14121,musta been a missile that acted on its own
14122,"ukraine has no cruise missiles , did they steal some from the russians and then shoot half of them down as well ?"
14123,oh . well that settles it then .
14124,"russia - "" it wasn't us who attacked the port \* pinky promise \*"""
14125,putin's favourite song is '' wasn't me by shaggy ''.
14126,"lol , this is rich . just who did they point the finger at ?"
14127,yeah . the missile just appeared out of nowhere and just happened to hit that city .
14128,is this right after ukraine and russia signed a un deal to let ukraine resume moving grain through the black sea ?
14129,sure budy .
14130,like that malaysian plane .
14131,"if i was president , you would deeply on your own soil ."
14132,"i bet it was the completely independent donetsk people's republic , not russia ."
14133,yea and when i eat beans i dont fart
14134,"yeah , they have a long history of honoring treaties , cease fires and evacuation corridors to back up their claims ."
14135,every week they pull some new stunt that reminds us how morally corrupt russia's leadership is
14136,"maybe if ylthe russian government weren't lying garbage people , we'd believe them . but they are lying garbage people who need to be buried in a flat grave ."
14137,"those missiles man , they do whatever they want"
14138,"randy marsh : "" righrightrightrightrightrightright """
14139,"oh okay sure . is there some rogue btg just going around doing what they want expending artillery as they see fit . either you ordered this strike , or you have no control of your forces ."
14140,oh it's someone else who attacked ukraine . aliens from outer space must have attacked the port .
14141,it was !
14142,russians lie . come on lol
14143,the russian government must believe that the turkish people are as foolish as the russians themselves - this is lying at the level of a three year old ...
14144,"hahahaha !!!! nice try , putin !! you and your lapdogs cant deceive me at all . next time come up with a better camouflage and lies !! get creative once in a while !!"
14145,it's important that everyone understands that lying is a part of russian culture .
14146,yes and i'm the next dalai lama ( with apologies to those that worship / follow the actual gentleman ).
14147,it was jewish space lasers they are fighting ukrainian nazis
14148,another lie 
14149,"he said that very firmly , so it must be true ."
14150,who even cares what they say !? russia is a terrorist state . should be demilitarized as soon as possible ! glory to ukraine! 
14151,dealing with the russians is like talking to a four year old
14152,russia has everything to do with it russia is lying about everything and i mean everything i dont trust any russian because they could be spying for the russian government .
14153,"uuuhhh , that was other kids "
14154,"putin trying to pull off some jedi mind tricks ... putin *( with hand in mind trick position )* : "" those were not russian attacks ."
14155,russia : we have it on good word that it was the crab people !
14156,putin's world of delusional disorder .
14157,and there are nazis in ukraine . fucking liars .
14158,russia cant handle the truth much less tell it .
14159,' we were aiming at a kindergarten and missed '

14163,ill believe that when me shit turns purple and smells like rainbow sherbet !
14164,"what's even the point of making this lie ? does russia genuinely think a single person believes them ? they have all the credibility of a dog with it's head stuck in the trash can , but a whole lot less cute ."
14165,"well they said it , it has to be true . "
14166,russia is a bunch of pussies
14167,had to be some other country invading ukraine .
14168,"so , they are saying they lost control of their kalibr missiles ? how embarrassing ."
14169,russia - i didn't fucking do it !
14170,russia has proved time and time again it's total lack of honesty . putin will use any excuse to steal land of others . a potentially great nation headed to the trash heap of history by a deluded population and vile and dishonest leadership .
14171,ohhhhhh so who was it ?
14172,"ah , must've be the wind then"
14173,and how much credibility does russia have left ?
14174,"russia keeps playing games , but in the end it wont be funny for them ."
14175,""" aight guys , they said they didn't do it . the problem is solved !"""
14176,and now russia admits to it
14177,little green men .
14178,"ok turkey , keep being putins bitch ."
14179,russia thinks that turkey is a turkey ! putin has eyes on the bosphorus and the dardanelles !
14180,sure ! the kurds are responsible !
14181,"right . ofc it wasn't ruzzia . but then who was it , hmm ? aliens ? foreign volunteers in ukraine army ? oh i know ! it was genetic engineered cats made by the ukrainians that was behind it !"
14182,this is who trump bends over for
14183,"more shameless , feckless bullshit from the shortarsed tyrant . he must have more front than brighton ffs . "
14184,"well if they say they didn't do it , we know they did ..."
14185,"if you leave out the bullshit from that statement , russia didn't say anything at all ..."
14186,"ask the donezk militias . they have missile launchers , too ."
14187,they also have a bridge they can sell to turkey really cheap
14188,but we know better
14189,kremlin needs a rod from god
14190,"i mean , even if true who will believe them at this point"
14191,"clearly , it was ukraine sabotaging their own grain shipments that it has fought so hard to negotiate for and needs to sell for its wartorn-economy that fired on itself to make russians look bad ! / s"
14192,the sad truth is that the turkish minister will believe them .
14193,"well , there were casualties in odessa today so that erdogan could finally get his much deserved humiliation . maybe he will cut the crap with finland and sweden now and come to his senses ( i know , i know , that's a lot to expect )."
14194,"it would make sense that someone else would want to botch any negotiation terms made . it's a great way to dis-credit the words of another nation . ruin every agreement that nation makes so that no deals or compromises can be made in the future because they can't be trusted to "" talk "". it prolongs war , brings negotiations for anything to a standstill , and can be extremely profitable . not saying that they wouldn't do it , just asking , "" why would they ""? i mean if they didn't want the deal in the first place , they wouldn't need to make the deal , why do that to ruin their own credibility ?"
14195,"yeah , it was that other cancerous shit-stain country that is bombing the crap out of ukraine at the moment ."
14196,it was like that when we got there
14197,"plausible deniability aka "" we all know you're lying but there is no specific repercussion """
14198,so russia confirms they did it . k .
14199,russia admits their military is in such a sad state they can't even get kremlin orders down to local units within 24 hours
14200,"of course they are lying , but in the other hand russia is one of the few countries that i can imagine where it is even remotely plausible that the military is shooting cruise missiles at a city and the civilian leadership of the same country believes it isnt them who is firing ."
14201,the depressing thing is that so many people will actually believe this .
14202,"i am pretty sure they are mocking turkey , turkey killed 8 iraqi civilians 2 days ago and then denied it thw russians are doing the same thing"
14203,obama did it
14204,"ah , turkiye and russia - the two most truthful governments ."
14205,it was probably ukraine
14206,turkey understands . it is just like turkey has nothing to do with all those pesky dead kurds .
14207,"is there any proof russia did it ? a small ship exploded in a port , could have been ammo cooking off , bomb planted etc . there are no videos or photos of flying cruise misses or of their debris , for most other strikes there are . some rogue elements inside ukraine might have faked the attack , to stop the deal ( which compromises security by increasing chance of landing and also releaves pressure on the world to do more ) or to get good pr"

14216,"if you watch the footage and squint you can actually see zelenskyi himself blowing up the grain silo personally just to ruin his own infrastructure and make africans starve . and he was grinning devilishly . \- putin , probably"
14217,i guess nato did it according to russia ? at this point i think russia can nuke a country theyd be able to blame someone else with their propaganda machine .
14218,can turkey send some aa's to odessa just so they can protect the agreement they were part of ?
14219,odessa was poisoned by its constituents .
14220,those damn ukrainians bombing themselves .
14221,johncandyohsure.gif
14222,russia selling farts
14223,i personally believe everything the russians tell us / s
14224,"so either russia lying , more than likely . or they have lost command and control of a portion of their army/navy somewhere in ukraine , unlikely but very frightening ."
14225,they could declare the sky was blue and i'd have to fact check it .
14226,they flew out of someone elses ass lavrov probably .
14227,i got a bridge id like to sell you
14228,msn articles : 2 paragraps stolen from other osint sources and an unrelated image . how is this journalism ?
14229,"given how fractured the russian command is right now , they probably had already given lower ranking leaders a schedule for attacks . these lower commanders didnt get the memo about the cease fire ."
14230,"sure , the missiles just materialized out of nothing over odessa ."
14231,uh huh .
14232,mmmhmm
14233,ah . ok then . launch some missiles into refineries inside russia and use the same we didnt do it \_()_/ story .
14234,they said that about civilian jets too
14235,so what message is russia sending and who are they sending it to ? is it turkey ? are they telling them that because they won't sell drones to them they are being punished with the threat of mass starvation .
14236,because so many other people are waging war on ukraine and have access to drop bombs in odessa you like um . or maybe it was hmm how about ? craig . craig probably did it . hate that guy .
14237,of course ! it was actually greenland who did this . those evil greenlanders ! / r
14238,well who the hell did it if it wasn't russia ? the cubans ?
14239,""" let's open up a new commission , and discuss these on the un assembly . we can get a resolution by 2025 if russia does not block it "". standard delay , and deflect tactics ."
14240,"not too far fetched . they can pretend it was "" whatever's peoples republic "" did that , and say the deal hasn't included them . that's what russia did during minsk negotiations from 2014 every time ukraine said it fulfilled its part of the deal and expects russia to do the same ."
14241,my russian father in law swears the ukrainians keep bombing themselves and blaming the russians . a brilliant plan .
14242,so belarus aka little puppet russia ?
14243,"vigorously stares at romania , bulgaria , georgia and turkey ."
14244,"reminds of an old norm joke . oj simpson denied beating his wife . norm retorted , "" as if oj isn't already busy enough finding the killers of his wife , he now has to find the wife beater too !"""
14245,stop hitting yourself ukraine !!!
14246,""" belarus """
14247,here's shaggy explaining the situation for you
14248,ukrainian nazis did it to themselves to make us look bad - actual russian position .
14249,"russian propaganda doesn't contain the concept of truth or lie . of course , it is an obvious brazen lie in the western sense , one that is deeply offensive to us , but it is really a different mindset in russia . the purpose of russian statements is to say what is necessary to gain an advantage , it is to create a reality that is beneficial to whatever russian goals are at the moment . it is completely , utterly unencumbered by the western idea of "" truth "". if this statement is picked up by any media and creates just one iota of doubt in some persons mind , then it has fulfilled it's mission . we would call that "" cynical lying "", in russia is just "" working as expected "". it reminds me of a clip on cnn where lavrov was asked about the atrocities in bucha , which he denied , which was followed by a step-by-step satellite recording proving the killing of a civilian on a bicycle by a tank , in great detail . lavrov didn't seem to be embarrassed by his lie , or apologetic , he seemed to be annoyed and mildly confused , as if he was thinking "" why are you showing this ? you are just making my job harder , what's your point ?"" russian propaganda will brazenly create alternate realities without missing a beat , which is something that is very , very hard to understand in other countries ."
14250,jewish space lasers man !
14251,"just curious , do they dribble their stool through a cloaca ? or some other way ?"
14252,"> yes , it was the space lizard people that are currently invading earth . tsss"
14253,i read that book series by harry turtledove
14254,[ or the transformers ?!](
14255,the little green men are back ?
14256,"ah , used the rothschild space laser did they ? / s"
14257,nah santa init .
14258,honestly if space lizard people were to invade russia right now im on team lizard .
14259,lying is a part of their national identity .
14260,"the same russians as they built up forces for "" training "": "" we're totally not invading you stupid idiots , stop fear mongering "" feb 24th : "" ahah ! of course we were always invading , you stupid idiots , stop resisting !"""
14261,it would imply that moscow has little to no control of its armed forces .
14262,"i wouldn't even say "" nice try "" since they clearly put no effort into it . next time russia try to come up with something plausible , or at least entertaining ."
14263,putins diplomatic strategy borrows heavily from bart simpsons i didnt do it episode .
14264,"or the russians claim that they didnt know the green men in crimea , and had no connections to shooting down flight 17 , and the same russia that had no troops or operators with the separatists , and that wasnt going to invade ukraine , and only was going to limit their ~~ invasion ~~ special operation to the separatist area , and the same russia that claims the moskva didnt sink and then sank because of a fire , and denies murdering their political opponents at home and abroad ."
14265,"with the mh17 shoot down , with the kal shoot down . etc"
14266,remember how they had nothing to do with the green men taking a vacation in ukraine 8 years ago ?
14267,normally the evil doers closely examine the situation for which they are responsible . looking for opportunities to blame others .
14268,"just like they had "" nothing to do "" with the "" separatists "" in donbas that shot down a civilian plane"
14269,"yeah , sounds like at least one of those russian ships has gone rogue and is at risk of turning to banditry . it should probably be hunted and the threat eliminated , not only to prevent further incidents but also so that as much of the ship can be returned to the rightful owners as possible ."
14270,"that's exactly it . russian hawks were in absolute shambles over the grain deal : divine master bent over for nato ! how can this be ! betrayal of all russian values , putin's possibly a lgbt double agent all along ! with the total collapse of russian command and control , and everyone working double-blind and hiding everything from everyone , i would not be surprised if this was some general's giant fuck you to the newly found "" cia asset "" in the kremlin ."
14271,"option e : russia says one thing , but does another ..."
14272,option e putin has lost control of parts of his military . there are reports the kremlin is split between hawks and doves and he can no longer bring the factions together .
14273,"useful idiots and boomers who only watch fox news and buy into conspiracy theories all believe russian propaganda , then they carry on in the same breath about how bad communism is without realizing they are an unknowing product of it . canada and the us have droves of these morons walking about . it is annoying at best and downright harmful at its worst ."
14274,"there are a lot of putin simps in comment sections , some people on r/conspiracy also like russia ."
14275,didn't some member of parliament call out one of the bombings before it happened ?
14276,"local police caught a few fsb agents placing the same explosives , as those used in the bombings , i . the basement of an appartment building . it was swept under the rug as an fsb exercise . those police saved the lives of the people who lived in that appartment . i dont think there were any more bombings after the fsb were caught . but putin , who was appointed president half way through his predecessors term , got his war . he went from a zero to a hero and was elected president of russia ."
14277,clearly that's why ukraine is asking for longer range missiles all the time . they need to go from ukraine to russia * and back again *.
14278,your joking but putin will 100 % claim that with a straight face
14279,yes and they also shot down their own cruise missiles with their own defense missiles ( of course they have a surplus of those ) just to make it believable . obviously .
14280,i mean given the mindset of people ukraine could do such false flag ops and everyone would believe them
14281,the country that cried wolf .
14282,to be fair they might not realise they're lying this time . their artillery is so bad that they might have been aiming at kyiv and hit odessa .
14283,"when russia says it "" has nothing to do "" with something , it actually had everything to do with it . lying is in its dna as a country ."
14284,this is why i am so frustrated that we are still buying fossil fuels from russia and it seems like many european politicians can't wait for the war to end to resume normal economic relations to russia .
14285,time for that decision on sendine fighter planes to ukraine .
14286,"i've heard wild tomahawks could spontaneously appear from another dimension and strike russian military assets , absolutely not nato fault"
14287,"if these missiles came from the sea , maybe something that can do some damage to the russian fleet"
14288,"its just russiaspeak again . whatever they say it means exactly the opposite . "" we will allow grain exports "" = we will bomb the shit out of your ports ( if only we had enough missiles ). "" we did not bomb any ports "" = we did bomb your ports lol . easy to understand once you get the hang of it ."
14289,"fun fact : that song came out 22 years ago , the same year putin came to power ."
14290,good old shaggy putin
14291,clearly you got downvotes for giving russia too much credit .
14292,"oh but i disagree ! the worth is in fact considerably * less * than 0 . it is not just a worthless token that will never be honored , rather it is a purposeful lie that is an informational attack meant to do harm to their enemies and in case thats not clear that is not ukraine in this case but us . we are the enemy . ukraine they attack with missiles . they attack us with a never-ending barrage of lies"
14293,"1-2 weeks was way too long , 0 moments before a breach was the only reasonable conclusion in foresight"
14294,not like the countries that want to be on russia's side care
14295,"they're not forgetting , they're just going all in on an alternate reality because it still fools those with very limited access to information . it's no coincidence that the last independent russian media organizations were forced to shut down right when the war started ."
14296,"quick , someone ask putin which door leads to the treasure ."
14297,"for a second , i thought you were talking about washington dc ."
14298,"lets commit genocide x4 , what could go wrong ?"
14299,"the syrian war is full of similar exchanges . who bombed 600 hospitals ? i dunno , probably the people . its a false flag ."
14300,ikr ? why ukraine thought it would be nice to build port right where russia wanted to send its missiles ?
14301,lukashenko joined the war and fired from belarusian submarines .
14302,probably any country that have caliber missiles in their army . after checking my notes i came to conclusion that amount of culprit countries ammount to 1 and is starts from r .
14303,russia did it they're just lying
14304,russia did it . they're blaming ukraine for their own actions . .. again .
14305,im going to guess its probably some country that is at war with ukraine .
14306,russia
14307,dont be confused . russia is lying . they obviously did it .
14308,it's not weakness ; understand that . russia decided a long time ago that truth * doesnt matter *. putin discovered the unfortunate ' power ' of anarchy a long time ago . it's not that he's weak . this is the way he's decided to go through his time on this earth .
14309,"it fired itself , i swear !"
14310,one russian missile did turn around and blew up its own launcher .
14311,agreed
14312,man ... i just watched that new jordan peele alien joint and now i'm not so sure that wouldn't happen .
14313,nobody cares about the spelling erdogan wants to use .
14314,hunter biden must be stopped ! who will he bomb next ?
14315,birds of a feather .
14316,i thought he was over the crap with finland and sweden ? they're both on track with membership . i thought .
14317,"russia discredits it's own word on the daily , and that's not exactly a secret . everything you describe as reasons someone may sabotage a deal is in the russian playbook . so , russia knows they are lying and they know other leaders know they are lying . the message isn't for the leaders it's for their ( russia's ) civilians and civilians in other countries . it serves a couple of external purposes - blaming the food crisis on ukraine to shore up putin's support in ( for example ) african nations and stoke their hatred of ukrainians , and creating confusion and division to chip away at ukrainian support in nato countries ."
14318,"it is pretty obvious that there are certain hidden powers / players that have sabotaged any agreements and negotiations all the way back since 2014 . whoever they are , they had a great opportunity for a false flag operation and i bet they took it . it indeed makes no sense for russia to undermine it's own credibility like this . unless of course this was some kind of a rogue action by a certain commander ( separatist or russian ). i guess we have to wait for some footage or evidence that could clear this up somehow ."
14319,barack 90 % civilian killing drone program obama
14320,like the pkk ?
14321,"it was a kalibr cruise missile . there's a video of two getting shot down , and two of them hit . nobody else uses that type of missile ."
14322,"even if there weren't ( there is , but let's pretend for fitness * and * fun ), there is exactly one country bombarding ukraine with missiles every single day and we don't need to throw stupefied glances and declare *"" how mysterious ! who in the world could have fired this specific missile at ukraine ?""* for every single one . we already know . spoiler : russia . russia fired this specific missile at ukraine . as a bonus i can save even more of your precious time by telling you that it also fired the one before it and the one after it ."
14323,wouldnt b too far fetched
14324,they were identified as kalibr missiles . nobody else in the region has those .
14325,they also pretended it wasn't them who shot down mh17
14326,there arent any peoples republics with weapons of that range from those peoples republics are located so not even an excuse
14327,"ah right so its a strat to force legitimize their bastard republics , gotcha . makes sense tbh"
14328,"the peoples republic military does not exist anymore though , 90 +% of them are all dead now ."
14329,"have they tried "" ukraine is trying to trick us by bombing itself "" yet ?"
14330,they fulfilled its part ?
14331,except it was fired calibr from a submarine
14332,i live in the uk and work with a russian lady that is adamant the ukrainians are bombing themselves and she has family in kharkiv .
14333,[ belarus ](
14334,none of these countries are ukraine's enemies
14335,"actually , its ; genetically-modified drug-addicted gay ukrainian nazis with bio-weapons - actual russian propaganda"
14336,"ukrainians stole russian kalibr missiles and they shot themselves with them , i can't even imagine how this doesn't sound plausible to all people on earth"
14337,"the majority of what is happening , according to non-russians i know in real life , is green screen effects with the ukrainian army stomping on their own cities as an attempt to pin the blame on russia . edit : what im trying to say is russia propaganda seem to be working on people outside russia ."
14338,"yup . it's [* vranyo *]( when you lie and everyone knows it , but you dont care . for anyone hasn't watched already i highly recommend this lecture by martti j . kari called [* evaluation of russia *]( ([ english translated audio ]( its about an hour long but is a huge eye opener about russian culture and why they do what they do . i'd also recommend the book * the invention of russia : from gorbachev's freedom to putin's war * by arkady ostrovsky ."
14339,"it also provides the cover for all sympathizers and/or useful idiots . oh look , russia said they didn't do it ! do we really know what happened ? unless they admit it , it's possible it was ukrainians/nato/combt gays"
14340,turkey won't put up with lies that hurt their image forever .. that's a dragon you don't want to wake
14341,i don't think this is a west/not-west thing . this is an authoritarian/right wing thing . china does this . so do republicans . it's lying . they know it . they just feel justified in doing so . they feel the advantage obtainable by lying is deserved and necessary .
14342,"> the purpose of russian statements is to say what is necessary to gain an advantage , it is to create a reality that is beneficial to whatever russian goals are at the moment . it is completely , utterly unencumbered by the western idea of "" truth "". yeah , so , this is a common human condition that most human beings grow out of by the time they're 10 or 11 . "" i didn't steal from the cookie jar ! the dog did it !"" isn't some foreign , but legitimate , logic set , it's a 5 year-old's logic . many human beings who grow beyond that point realize that lies should be more believable . then again , plenty of politicians who think otherwise ."
14343,"its fine that they lie , it also means no one should believe them or work with them . the western world has been unencumbering themselves from russia ."
14344,"you just described trump . so yeah , i think the west gets it plenty ."
14345,you can buy them wholesale !
14346,jewish * nazi * space lasers .
14347,"yes . and they excrete uric acid , so their poop looks like birdshit . thery are actually warm blooded , so not actually lizards . more like birds or dinosaurs . ( yep . conspiracy nuts discussed all this on usenet back in the 90s . i'll see if i can find a link ...)"
14348,"think ' centipede ' ( the movie ) with putzin stitched in the lead , and the rest of russia by societal standing ."
14349,[ boris nemtsov ]( was a russian anti-putin politician . he was assassinated very close to the kremlin . to provide us context : this would be like if a leading politician was assassinated on the national mall . russia denied responsibility and arrested some chechians ...
14350,we need to get video clips of putin contradicting himself and cut them together . i'm sure he's denied invasion multiple times on video saying it's just western provocation before it started
14351,"to be fair , i don't think anyone ( other than the heads of french and german intelligence ) was caught off guard by the invasion . they're just so blatant in their lies ."
14352,"reminds me of a comic "" 5 stages of ... arguing with a russian nationalist "" by polandball ( 2014 )"
14353,pliable enough to pretend to believe it .
14354,"> yeah , sounds like at least one of those russian ships has gone rogue and is at risk of turning to banditry can't really call it going rogue when banditry is the standard mo of much of their forces ."
14355,"risk of turning to banditry is quite high , as russia is a literal bandit kingdom ."
14356,> it should probably be hunted but there is is no way to tell if there is more than one so let's just be safe and sink them all .
14357,that is covered by my option a
14358,"wild extension of this option : if he's not in control of the military he's in control of nothing . he's kept as a figure head scapegoat . if war escalates too far or they start losing too hard he can be killed off ... followed by the "" new "" power structure . then more lies get spread about putin making them continue on with the war . magically absolving everyone else of blame"
14359,"someone did but they screwed up and announced a bombing on september 13th that would not to take place for another three days in volgodonsk ! alexander litvinenko reported that someone had mixed up the order of the blasts and called it , "" the usual kontora mess up "". litvinenko would die from polonium-210 poisoning in 2006 . two fsb agents andrey lugovoy and dmitry kovtun have been named as the prime suspects in assassinating litvinenko under the order of vladimir putin ."
14360,alexander litvinenko was right in saying that putin was running a crime family in russia . the whole government is run like mario puzo's the godfather .
14361,"turkey has radar , their military most likely will be able to make an assessment where the missile came from . if not that , being in nato they could probably ask for and received the radar data from the us radar planes flying near enough to have tracked all 4 missiles . so , yea , ukraine could trick everyone on this sub . but they're not going to trick the relevant governments ."
14362,the western intellig3nce agencies would all have to agree not to let the cat out of the bag . ukraine isnt operating in an informational vaccuum where only they and russia have information on the issues . western intellegence is highly integrated .
14363,they could but really dont have to .
14364,for what reason exactly ? the deal is beneficial to them
14365,the country that * is * the wolf .
14366,"artillery can suffer from faulty barrels but missiles and rockets , not so much ."
14367,"if it happens , nato will have "" nothing to do "" with it ."
14368,"i didn't expect them to break the treaty within 24 hours , there is absolutely no immediate benefit for the russians to bomb odesa port ."
14369,"that was funny af , gj"
14370,they do when they find out how it impacts their actions .
14371,"god damnit , romania !"
14372,yes ! it was hunter biden who did it ! lol !
14373,not according to his most recent statements .
14374,"[ i will just leave this here .]( the turks are not good people in this situation , not that many people are good people to the kurds in general , but it is saying something to say that turkey might be the worst ."
14375,"there is a ton of videos of rockets flying from direction of the sea , by people who visited beaches today . so either georgia has decided to wage war on us , or russian mouth if so full of shit as always ."
14376,"cmon , those are just rebels from those shit republics who bought those missile systems in hunters supply stores / s"
14377,but russia will say that you can buy them in every shop with hunting equipment .
14378,there was a ship at the grain terminal in the port of odesa not very far away from where one missile hit . loading grain is one of the most dangerous operations in a port because of the risk of a dust explosion . so sending a missile into a port where there are ships at the grain terminal must feature high on the darwin award list .
14379,kal-007 . they've got form .
14380,"that's why russia keeps doing it . also , gives away prisoners and civilians to these pseudo-states . that's how they can torture and murder people while claiming to be uninvolved . like these fighters who are married to ukrainian women and journalists from uk who are about to be executed by "" shit nr "" after being captured by russia ."
14381,"its not unheard of . our russian family is just 200km from the border so there is a lot of mixing over the border . we know at least 4 or 5 personal stories of a family member on the ukrainian side and the russian side cant believe . true story : sister in ukraine : they are bombing everything !! sister in russia : youre an idiot !! you are wrong !!! hang up the phone . sister in russia , well sadly ill never be able to talk to her again something is fucked in human nature when the news feed is believed over your family members own testimony of bombs falling . yet , head in the sand seems to be our default state in the face of disaster . ( think climate change and its response )"
14382,she'll probably have no family in kharkiv soon enough ( provided they still regard her as family ).
14383,"well that's the point . turkey : wtf russia russia : dunno . you sure you didn't do this ? ' cause it wasn't us because , um , that's what we say ."
14384,"exactly ! it means they conspired to make poor russia look bad ! see , it's really easy if you're willing to just make shit up ."
14385,remember its not nazi but jewish-nazi
14386,don't forget to add jews and witches . ukrainian genetically modified drug addicted nazi jewish gay witches . russian propaganda has achieved levels of bullshit nobody previously imagined .
14387,"> actually , its ; genetically-modified drug-addicted gay ukrainian nazis with bio-weapons - actual russian propaganda glad you specified the source , i thought i'd tuned into jerry springer by accident !"
14388,don't forget black magic .
14389,you forgot witches and their black magic
14390,"this is actually how soviets was talking about murder of polish military officers in katyn . * nazi killed them using captured soviet weapon . that's why there are soviet bullets in bodies , but nazi did this , totally . they are bad and we are good .*"
14391,"apparently that's actually being said ( except for the "" inside russia "" part )."
14392,"except when i click your profile , this is your only comment so your claim of calling out this yesterday is suspect ( not that i believed russia would honor its agreement )."
14393,what are you on about ?
14394,i think you hit your head as a child too hard
14395,thank you for the video link ! there's even a dubbed version !
14396,"it's a core part of their playbook . just one component of the "" firehose of bullshit "" strategy ."
14397,they do it because there'e no consequences
14398,i bet there is a jewish nazi moon base too .
14399,please don't . let the sleeping horrors lie .
14400,"i've heard they have a tongue-like organ in their cloaca , with an articulating tip like a birds beak , that darts in and out rhythmically . i don't remember where i heard that ."
14401,"kadyrov might have indeed ordered it on his own as "" gift "" to putin . one of his duma mps , adam delimkhanov ( a three figure $ millionaire ) is said to run his moscow hitsquad . incidentally , he barely visits parliament ."
14402,i would be suprised if there arent andy of them . maybe they are waiting for the invasion to be over to get morer content
14403,they too knew but relied too much on russia to do anything
14404,"malaysian mh17 , back in 2014 . they've tried to blame that one on ukrainians , too . actually the plane was shot down by a russian buk with russian operators from 53rd missile brigade from kursk ."
14405,my apologies !
14406,for anyone interested in the litvinenko story theres a really good podcast called british scandal which tells the whole thing .
14407,"that journalist is the "" putin is a pedophile "" guy . i wonder why he published that article , seems like a weird accusation to make ."
14408,"the lies are intended for us , not the governments . lying to the enemy is what you do in war and so they lie without remorse . you never give the enemy free information . its personal . we are the enemy . you are the enemy ."
14409,"i mean why would western intelligence even spill the beans ? western goal is fucking ruzzia over , they dont need to agree on anything as silence is the default position especially if it helps ukraine"
14410,"so , a crying emo wolf that nobody likes ."
14411,"stop it . a-10s are useful when you have air supremacy . ukraine doesn't have that , and doesn't even want a-10s . they have said so . it's time to move on from the whole a-10 in ukraine thing ."
14412,i don't want to put the finite amount of ukrainian pilots in giant titanium coffins . the amount of manpads present on both sides makes it a suicide machine . they should get useful jets like the f-15 and f-16 instead .
14413,"no no no , you're thinking of the beautiful country that brought us sebastian stan . it's rwanda ."
14414,i have it on good authority that rwanda did it .
14415,"the situation used to be less then ideal ( though it would be unwise to take everything on wiki at face value ) with the kurds in turkey but right now turkish kurds enjoy by far the highest standard of living compared to iranian , iraqi or syrian kurds . turkey even had a kurdish prime minister before and they currently occupy lots of high ranking positions . there are still ways to go but it's not nearly as bad as people in the west think it is ."
14416,people are visiting beaches in a war zone ? does that make me an absolute pussy for skipping thanksgiving because i dont like my wifes cousin ?
14417,it has been noted that large amounts of shit ( of the bull and horse variety ) has been seen seeping out of russian mouths as of late .
14418,if a russian is breathing their lying
14419,i vote russian mouth full of shit
14420,"russia has a militairy base in georgia , and georgia has 2 provinces full of seperatists .. not too far fetched to be honest"
14421,how about orban ? doesn't he have a few kalibr he may have gotten as a personal gift from his poo-tin .

14519,so just make the entire area around the plant inaccessible .
14520,"because human shields arent bad enough , lets use a nuclear disaster as a shield by storing dangerous explosives in a fucken nuclear plant . what the shit , even bond villians werent this fucken bad"
14521,this is pretty concerning if it's true . the russians have already proven they don't know shit about nuclear safety when they dug trenches in irradiated dirt .
14522,"i know its against the geneva convention , but i imagine the easiest way to take back such a plant would be to gas the bastards inside"
14523,"phuck all of this transformers villain shit . i wish there was some secret portal back to the old days hiding out in a diner in maine , stephen king style ."
14524,"i've said it before and will say it again . when the opportunity allows , all they need to do is completely surround them . no need to risk engaging them as it can damage the plant . so instead , surround it and cut off all supplies . let them starve out and if they wish to survive this , they need to surrender ."
14525,"so what we have are the russians using not just the workers of that plant as human shields , but by placing those weapons so close to the reactor , they make attacking those resources so risky that you simply cannot even try . seems russia's trying to encourage western nations to put boots on the ground . the results of those reactors going into meltdown would be felt around the world ."
14526,it's odd reading something smart done by russians .
14527,"smart way to protect your weapons cache ?? kinda of like a giant human shield , where that human is everyone within several hundred miles ??"
14528,bomb the roads leading to the nuclear plant . make the weapons inaccessible .
14529,this is a russian publication right ? the moscow times ? is anyone else trying to read this account through those glasses ? im just wondering - with all the disinformation that russia has been feeding the world how to read this .
14530,theyre literally poisoning themselves to be assholes
14531,is that better or worse than human shields ?
14532,dick move..but still slick
14533,just level all the transformers outside the facility .
14534,"wait , so you mean that to deprive them of said arsenal all they need is to secure the location ? the russians just shot themselves in their foot . with a gun or an rpg launcher i cannot say"
14535,"cant they use cheap drones for constant surveillance ? russians can't use the weapons if they cannot go outside . when they do go out , that is when you rocket their asses ."
14536,that sounds like a terrible idea .
14537,"ah , so it shows they've run out of conventional places to hide their shit without being blown to bits ."
14538,they did same shit in chernobyl so its not even suprising
14539,"damn , russia trying to buff their weapons with radioactive damage because they are so shit at warfare . please dont forget to bathe in reactor fluids for bonus perks too !"
14540,"could ukraine potentially destroy a minor part of the facility , which would result in lethal radiation in a small area around the facility ? which in turn would force them to move their equipment or die ?"
14541,us national public radio reported yesterday that ukraine claims russia is firing missiles from this location
14542,sounds like desperation to me .
14543,"of course they would . fortunately , once they leave it's protection , they are added to the target list . in the meantime , life inside the plant is not safe either . [ link ]("
14544,"100 % shitty , but a smart war tactic"
14545,nothing to worry about . reddit assured me that nuclear power plants are completely safe and nothing can go wrong . we should build more of these . as the future is probably very stable and will not see much conflict these very safe power plants are the best investment .
14546,smart idea not gonna lie
14547,its actually not entirely surprising considering more modern reactors are of much better construction with way more safety features . the old soviet reactors were hot trash with very few fail safes and poor design .
14548,the reactors are a different model ( vver ) that is much safer than chornobyl's rbmk . their outer structures are also designed to resist something like a 9/11 attack .
14549,"> meltdowns of it's massive six reactors just a few hundred km from the black sea is a horror story for europe and the entire mediterranean not actually , no . they'd be bad to have melt down , but there would be less radiation release than chernobyl , and less area affected ."

14553,"inb4 russian munitions malfunction and damage the reactors , and russia blames ukraine ."
14554,"but with the accuracy of the artillery ukraine has received , i'd think they could basically build a moat around the npp , making it very difficult getting things in and out of ."
14555,i guess everyone was expecting russia to sit back and do nothing while their ammo stockpiles get destroyed
14556,you'd also gas the workers though so ..
14557,"at the cost of the hostages , but i think they may not survive and they are well aware of that ."
14558,"> the results of those reactors going into meltdown would be felt around the world . not really . it would be bad , but the consequences would be local . if the reactors melted down at all ( which would only be possible if someone literally tried to do that ) it's not likely the fuel would escape the reactor vessel , which doesn't have any penetrations in its lower half ... no valves , pipes , or anything , just a big deep bowl . the vver reactors have a negative void coefficient , so if coolant stops flowing due to missile impact or deliberate shut down , the reaction slows and generates less heat and power . chernobyl was the opposite . they're relatively safe reactors , about the only thing that could release radiation is a direct hit on the containment vessel by a runway penetration bomb or a nuke ."
14559,"i don't think you people understand how modern nuclear reactors work , for some reason you think evolution stopped in 1986 at chernobyl . even if somehow fuel escapes the reactor vessel the damage will be extremely local ."
14560,how is it smart to break the law and store weapons in q facility that can irradiate a huge territory if they detonate ?
14561,is moscow times still based in russia ? or is it an opposition paper outside the country ? yeah its an opposition paper pushed out of russia and is now online only out of the netherlands .
14562,in what way are they poisoning themselves ?
14563,i'd say it's more of a larger scale human shield since blowing it up would be a huge problem for a lot of people .
14564,at least there arent ukrainian civilians being forcefully held in the same schools and hospitals as meat shields . oh wait
14565,i wonder if there is a time of year when the wind blows east ?
14566,it just provokes a need to give ukraine weapons that would restore balance to deter russia from gaining advantage from this . any suggestions ? which deterrent would you like ukraine to receive ?
14567,"yeah totally , because if the us gets attacked , the aggressor will be decapitated in months at worst ."
14568,until it isn't .
14569,as far as war crimes go .
14570,"not really , in the end , ukraine can remain at a distance and surround the place . it will be a matter of time before they either run out of bullet/food etc . the only thing they'll have plenty of is electricity but unfortunately russia doesn't have "" energy weapons "" in its arsenal ."
14571,"with russia's history of old outdated/unstable junk , it sounds like a disaster in the making .. "" oops , we dropped one "".."
14572,"it stops there being one big depot to hit , but its a major problem from a logistics standpoint anyways ( which was not really something russia was showing strength in at the first place ). easy to hit supplies in route , easy to misroute or delay critical gear to hotspots . its less of a smart move and more a desperate one ."
14573,"it's like that climatic battle in the onion movie . then again in retrospect , the actor that played the action hero guy isn't exactly a good role model ."

14575,"there is nothing smart about it . an average 10-year-old could have thought it up . at my university there was a self-serve cash register ( yes , really ). just because i could have gotten the idea to steal money from it , it does not make me "" smart "". please don't confuse being willing to break norms and decency with being smart ."
14576,"you are right , thank goodness for better safety features . if anything good came out of chernobyl disaster , it was the need for better safety engineering . this npr article breaks down the initial attack on zaporizhzhia npp , but also explains the type of core containment and what it can withstand . apparently , this npp was designed with post-chernobyl level safety . in case of core meltdown , even if the steel containment is breached , the biological containment would effectively do its job and no ground contamination is expected . moreover , in case of an earthquake ( or a missile impact ), the reactors would automatically shutdown . unfortunately , this means russians would not get irradiated and die off on their own / sigh ."
14577,"i'm aware . same was said for fukushima and i believed them . any reactor can meltdown and it's always possible that radiation escapes . this is the first time in history that humanity is waging war around a power reactor so neither chernobyl or fukushima are a good comparison , all i know it's far from safe ."
14578,"in case of a human mistake like chernobyl yes . but in case of a power loss combined with a missile attack on the reactor and you have a much bigger problem than chernobyl . plus now there are without the resources and manpower of the ussr that was able to clean it up . they are massing explosives near it ffs , and their artillery is worse in aiming than a average storm trooper . literally accident waiting to happen"
14579,"options in 1945 : 1 : nuke , ending war with minimal american casualties . plus , we were already firebombing so on a moral scale it wasn't anything new . 2 : invade japan , risk soviets getting to tokyo first , millions of projected losses . which sounds better ?"

14586,i wasn't expecting them to take the most dangerous option . that's for sure .
14587,i mean ... ukraine can just blow up everything around the plant .
14588,russia seems to think it's actions won't have consequences . they are not thinking clearly may need to learn the hard way .
14589,"thats definitely the main barrier to using them - saying that , if you could get some forewarning in and they had the right gear on , it could be a selective attack perhaps ? ive no idea honestly"
14590,i prefer not to subject nuclear reactors to artillery . it is entirely possible that the safety considerations will prove sufficient . but it's also not something i'd be happy rolling the dice on .
14591,"no . i am a strong proponent of nuclear power , and the constant evolution of nuclear has not been lost on me . but zaporizhzhia npp * is * a soviet reactor . it was built 40 years ago and is only \~ 5 years newer than the chernobyl plant was . the constant evolution that we've seen , it hasn't seen a lot of it . secondly , safety measures can't really be guaranteed when you start adding artillery to the mix . something intended to deliberately cause catastrophic damage to things . in the middle of a city , connected to a major river , connected to a bunch of other smaller towns . what's more , zaporizhzhia's reactors have 3 times the thermal capacity . "" local "" damage is still extraordinarily damaging to ukraine . and given the impacts we're already seeing to the world's food supply , irradiating even more of ukraine is in no way a good thing for the people who have nothing to eat now ."
14592,"yeah its smart to keep them from getting blown up by oh hi mars ! but its insanely idiotic if they have a smoking accident and send a nuclear cloud over a nato country triggering article 5 . its as if they are using the chess strategy of making every offensive move defensive as well , except theyve replaced defensive with idiotic moves . bold strategy ."
14593,you answered your own question .
14594,they hid their weapons where no one with a brain would fire .
14595,thanks - i was wondering
14596,oh come on nobody would be stupid enough to bomb and shoot at a nuclear plant :)
14597,"well for now it's a good deterrent to ukraine himars attacks . so it's not bad idea from russia's perspective , which means ukraine would need to focus on destroying bridges instead . good bye crimean bridge ."
14598,"true , but who knows at this point ."
14599,irradiated weapons that harms the wielder as well as the target
14600,"you mean "" fortunately ""."
14601,when was the last time russia accidentally blew up their own ammo ? or are you just circle jerking for karma ?
14602,"> post-chernobyl level safety . that level is basically the western level from the seventies . vver reactor is entirely different beast from the graphite moderated rbks , it's both cooled and moderated by pressurized water . its much more similar to the fukushima plan than the chernobyl one . but it's still a rather old facility and waging war around it can create millions of problems . > moreover , in case of an earthquake ( or a missile impact ), the reactors would automatically shutdown fine , but what if they are cut of from the grid and can't power the reactor shutdown and russian army won't give them the fuel for the backups ? it's utter stupidity but since february my expectations dropped considerably regarding the intelligence of the russian army"
14603,"fukushima was hit by natural events an order of magnitude higher than it was designed for , and even then it didn't go worse than it did ."
14604,you realise that the incident on fukushima was nothing compared to chernobyl ?
14605,there's no one firing missiles directly at the core .. it's hitting the containment .
14606,"> but in case of a power loss combined with a missile attack on the reactor and you have a much bigger problem than chernobyl . no , you don't . these are much safer reactors ."
14607,"im not american so pardon my confusion . wasnt robert mcnamara the secretary of defense and chief architect for the vietnam war ? the what 20-30 year gap between ww2 and vietnam isnt adding up to me . or was he commenting on ww2 ? sorry its late here , im confused"
14608,lets just agree they were both pretty awful . the us put japanese americans in internment camps don't forget .
14609,"they have a pacifist constitution because they were conquered and had their cities nuked , when you sign an unconditional surrender the victors dictate everything that comes after ."
14610,depends on whose side you were on
14611,"tuskegee , war on drugs , war on poverty , etc doesn't really compare to eradicating 6 million jews and "" undesirables "" in under a decade . comments like this just make you look moronic ."
14612,lot easier to say that when you're not the one blowing up your home town .
14613,you could just as easily use that argument to justify giving up the donbas .
14614,"i wasn't expecting it either , but it isn't * that * surprising coming from a country that has been threatening nuclear strikes since before the war started"
14615,"goodbye roads . goodbye rail . goodbye boats , on which the weapons may sail . bomb a fucking crater around the plant ."
14616,"yes , i expect ukraine will escalate in response . this is what happens in a war"
14617,> ive no idea honestly that much is abundantly clear . may i make a suggestion to look up whether what you're saying they should do is a war crime first ?
14618,yeah really smart if an accidental detonation of ammo irradiates half the eurasian landmass .
14619,"they hid explosives and ammunition in the engine room , which tends to get a little hot ."
14620,"because in the entire history of explosive devices , none has ever detonated accidentally ?"
14621,"but it was shelled just yesterday , and russia complained to iaea about this"
14622,ever hear about the acropolis in greece getting blown up when stored ammunition combusted .
14623,all it takes is one moron with a cigarette to fuck up everything
14624,"except it already fucking happened when they took over that plant ,"
14625,"it just takes one person dropping a shell , putting a truck in reverse not drive , anything and you get a second chernoble ."
14626,"russia did , and there is quite a big safety concern to store explosives in a nuclear plant"
14627,sounds like the same guys who kicked up dirt and dug into it in chernobyl .
14628,nobody but a russian .
14629,[ ukraine might not want to destroy that bridge ]( a common war strategy is to give an otherwise trapped enemies a clear route of retreat because trapped enemies will fight to the death .
14630,nuclear plants are preety safe from radiation i doubt it will radiate the weapons unless you keep them near the core its most likely in some control room or some other storage facility wich are safe from radiation
14631,"they aren't doing it to irradiate the weapons . they're doing it to prevent the ukrainians from blowing up their weapon store . the ukrainians have been using himars to decimate russian supply depots lately . it has had a remarkable effect on their ability to sustain artillery fire . obviously russia has tons more , but that still needs to be trucked in ... and we all know how * amazing * russia's logistics are ."
14632,"yes , read it with a sarcastic voice"
14633,that's their official story for the sinking of the moskva .
14634,"i mean , the kursk comes immediately to mind"
14635,agree with you on both counts - never underestimate the russian capacity for fuck-uppery . and humanity is definitely far from having a safe nuclear power .
14636,"> an order of magnitude higher than it was designed for yes but that means it was underdesigned . having the only backup generator located in a floodable basement is not tsunami protected at all , but is a huge design flaw . tepco knew that the sea wall was too short even in 09 . don't justify their mistakes and carelessness with the act of god . i'm a nuclear energy advocate but the fukushima disaster was preventable and the initial response should have been much better and faster than it was ."
14637,"not nothing , but smaller on the scale . what's your point ?"
14638,"where did i say they would shoot it at the core ? i've said reactor , obviously meaning the reactor building not fairytale missles that can skip walls . single crack can make the pressure of the melted core to burst that wall like a can opener . you are acting like my comment is directed at a normal day in a npp , not one inside a war zone with one combatant already showing total disregard to the dangers of nuclear energy . exhibited in april when they ransacked chernobyl lab and made a damn picnic in the middle of the bloody red forest ."
14639,are you trying to tell me that they can run a reactor safely without power or access to fuel to run backup generators ?
14640,"yeah , interment was bad but ask yourself which internment camo would you rather be in ? american of japanese ? what japan did in korea , china , southeast asia rivals anything the nazis did . comfort women , rape on nanking , unit 738 , butan death march ? also the nuclear bombs were dropped in the face of invading the home islands . okinawa was a blood bath . 94 % casualty rate for the japanese not to mention the civilian causalities and the fact that civilians were pressed into fighting or commit mass suicide . the bombs were dropped with an intent to save american and japanese lives . did america do bad things ? we had segregation , internment camps , etc . yeah it was bad . imperial japan was another level of bad ."
14641,"yes - also outside the 2 nukes we bombed the shit out of japan and killed additional 800,000 civilians . japanese also did awful shit . like i said one country's hero is anothers war criminal . all a matter of perspective , wars ars like that . if nazis won ww2 , all of those war criminals would have been heroes , consider that for a second"
14642,"yeah , the thing is , their cops did not even carry guns afterwards because of a national commitment to pacifism and only started to do so after us occupying forces kind of made them . japan has never owned their war crimes like germany has , but there has also been a deep national commitment to avoiding the militarism of the past . its changing a bit more recently but 75 years was a pretty long run ."
14643,the japanese people were suffering a lot as the war dragged on . i don't speak for the japanese in 1945 but a quick end was probably what they wanted deep down .
14644,"the fact that the us welcomed with open arms the very people that played a part in the extermination of those 6 million people to build weapons and do medical experiments on countless more people makes them pretty fucking awful if you ask me . almost like "" we really like what you were doing , let us help you do more on the dl , just make sure you share your notes with us "". that we were better than nazis at the time doesn't make us the good guys"
14645,"leveling to the ground , you mean , not giving up shit ."
14646,did you miss the first comment i made where i outright stated it would be against the geneva convention ?
14647,russian ammo quality standard don't even need a cigarette to fuck up everything
14648,yeah it's not exactly helping anxiety when russians are piling rockets inside eu's largest nuclear plant .
14649,that was the implication of the guy you answered ..
14650,the plant is built to survive bomb attacks . which is good because russia already hit it with tank shells .
14651,"it takes multiple people looking over a valve that wasnt automatically closed by the automated systems run in neckwear power generators , though we shant discount computer error cause it does happen"
14652,"that's only relevant if ukraine intends to liberate crimea by force , which they have suggested they aren't planning to do . in the meantime , russia keeps ferrying troops and supplies via crimea , via the bridge . without that bridge , crimea is basically under siege until the end of the war , which if anything would put pressure on putin to end the war faster ( not that i think it would have any real effect )."
14653,crimean bridge is a supply route . armies that get supplies and reinforcements usually have no reason to order a strategic retreat . and geneva convention ensures you always have a way out - surrender .
14654,right from the art of war . one of the oldest tactics out there
14655,"they have lots of places to retreat , via land into russia for one ."
14656,i doubt that is still applicable to modern combat operation
14657,"they wouldn't be encircled . they could still evacuate via the ferries and other boats . that bridge is actually new , the road bridge opened in mid-2018 , and when they seized crimea in 2014 and ukraine cut them off , they had to use boats to travel and supply the peninsula . point here being that they made due without a bridge before , it was just more difficult . personally , i would be fully on board with ukraine making things much more difficult for russia . they would not have an issue retreating if that is what they wanted to do ."
14658,artillery kind of changes that concept . it's kind of hard to fight like a cornered animal when steel rain is pounding you in the open .
14659,or surrender to be exchange for prisoner swap .
14660,retreating armies often sustain heavier losses than if they'd stayed put .
14661,"exactly , don't get me wrong , im a huge advocate of nuclear energy , but all those security precautions matter only in developed countries , in undeveloped countries especially those plagued by corruption nuclear energy can get very scary"
14662,"run , no . shut down automatically , yes ."
14663,"oh i see , thanks for clearing that up"
14664,""" we killed civilians to save civilians "" -- well that only works as an explanation when you win . if germany won , they would have said the same thing - that the blitz saved british lives by convincing them to surrender before a bloody land invasion . but they lost , so luftwaffe generals were convicted of war crimes for doing basically the same thing that their allied counterparts did in dresden , tokyo , hiroshima , and nagasaki . intentionally killing tens of thousands of civilians is wrong . nagasaki and hiroshima were wrong . saying that it was for their own good is ridiculous , along the lines of the bullshit that putin says to justify the invasion in ukraine , and yet we eat up that explanation for nagasaki/hiroshima without thinking about it critically . now there were obviously some places were the axis powers were far worse ( no extermination camps in the us , etc .), but that doesn't mean we didn't do anything wrong . i think we are way too quick to rationalize away or forget the crimes us did in a way that we don't with other countries ."
14665,"its not a matter of perspective . nazi death camps , looting , war of conquest . japanese war of conquest , comfort women , unit 738 , rape of nanking , butan death march , and many other horrific war crimes . these are all objectively bad and worse than the allies . a world where the axis won would be objectively and universally horrific . its not perspective . there is objectivity . stop being edgy ."
14666,> a quick end was probably what they wanted deep down . i bet you quite a lot of the kids we nuked out of those 200k probably wanted to live .
14667,"you might want to look them up before you disconsider them . basically it's the oldest foreign backed russian based(though not since 2017 , when it was basically declared illegal ). it's about as trustworthy a source as you can get ."
14668,will it survive bomb attacks from the inside is the question though
14669,if russia is defending the bridge its because they did the math and realized they are boned if it goes .
14670,"> and geneva convention ensures you always have a way out - surrender . in practice , this route is rarely taken partly because individual soldiers rarely have a good chance to surrender . it's not like they can just turn themselves in to the nearest police station like peacetime criminals can ."
14671,old does not automatically equal good .
14672,"if you look at a map , there are 2 land connections from crimea to the rest of ukraine , and a connection to russia via the bridge , but no _land_ connection to russia except via the bridge . the areas of ukraine around the land bridges have both been occupied by russia since feb 24 , but they would be liberated by ukraine if ukraine ever pushes into crimea . there's no way ukraine could seriously push into crimea without without taking those two land bridges ."
14673,"i recommend watching some of [ simon ostrovsky's "" on the ground "" videos during the 2014 crimean invasion ]( the scale and resistance of the 2014 invasion is much different than now . the russians ( who already had sailors and ships in crimea before invading because they leased the sevastopol naval base ), came in almost without a single shot fired at them . the russians can certainly can still escape via air and sea , but it wouldn't be the same as in 2014 if ukraine eventually makes substantial progress in crimea ."
14674,i agree to an extent . but i think the mariupol defenders show how encircled enemies can cause lots of problems .
14675,"shutting down a reactor is easy in almost any condition , dealing with the super hot rods isn't . shutting down stops the nuclear reaction , but the heat energy is still there and needs to cool of with water . without power the water pumps stop injecting water on to the core and then you have a problem . even then it's manageable , but you need access to a lot of resources and access to the plant . what i mean is if anything were to happen , the entire european continent is in the mercy of the capabilities of a russian military officer on the field who has no idea about running a npp , only thing he knows he can't make his superior mad . i can't comprehend how can you be so confident and ignore this situation ."
14676,">"" we killed civilians to save civilians "" -- well that only works as an explanation when you win . it works if you are not the aggressor . yes , you could say that the blitz would save lives compared to a protracted bloody war . but how about compared to * not fucking starting a war *? if you are on the defending side , that is simply not an option . you can't un-invade yourself by power of friendship ."
14677,"germany and japan were fighting wars of aggression , subjugation and conquest . it works because after the war the us helped rebuild japan and germany and many other war affected nations . because had germany won , or japan won , the plight of their neighbors would have been continued genocide , enslavement and conquest . the allies did many things wrong . but many of those choices were made in good faith . nagasaki and hiroshima were really done to save japanese and american lives . nothing germany or japan did was for any other purpose than their militaristic aims . that is the difference . this false equivalence takes away all meaning from anything ."
14678,"if nazis won - they would write the history books painting themselves as heroes . none of the atrocities would be recognized as such . what i am saying is not edgy , its true . victors determine heroes . would the world be horrific , of course it would , but that would over time become the "" normal "", thus a matter of perspective . once you normalize horror , you change perspective"
14679,"yeah , nobody wants to die . but we scorched entire cities out of existence with firebombing . i said this earlier but the nuke was not new.in crossing a moral boundary . don't believe me ? look up pictures of tokyo after we bombed it ."
14680,"i suppose it probably depends on what part of the "" inside "" is used . i doubt they are storing explosives inside the reactor core . inside the containment building(s )? might be a possibility . that would be very stupid , but maybe possible . inside the buildings that house turbines , generators , or switch gear ? that would be also be very stupid . perhaps less stupid , and more possible . some of those have lots of floor space . inside other auxiliary and administrative buildings ? if the explosions are any place outside the containment building , the reactor itself would very likely survive . those containment buildings are very sturdy . i can just imagine placing ammunition too close to switch gear . an arc-flash would be expected , at those voltages ."
14681,"i'm sorry , what ? when the unit is in no position to fight and break encirclement , its commander surrenders with the unit . as we have seen in this war , armies would rather retreat than risk it . kyiv , sumy-chernihiv , sieverodonetsk . mariupol defenders fought to the last , but they were getting resupply/medevac by helicopter for a while . and they ultimately surrendered and are being exchanged ."
14682,"they can literally just find a stick and tie something white resembling a flag , and then carry it high while marching towards the ukrainians ."
14683,just like us constituion ?
14684,"of course , what i meant is that russia can retreat through the land it already occupies . it's true that if this changes , the bridges become more important ."
14685,"> without power the water pumps stop injecting water on to the core and then you have a problem . not with this reactor design . it's got a negative void coefficient .... that means if the water stops flowing and it starts to heat up , eventually the water boils ... in this type of reactor , those bubbles actually slow down the reaction . what would happen is that the reaction would stabilize at a level too low to generate power or huge amounts of heat until water flow was restored . alternatively , you could insert the control rods to stop the reaction completely . in neither case would the reactor melt down or explode ."
14686,"i frankly find it very fucked up that people seem to be taking issue with the idea that intentionally killing civilians is always wrong no matter who does it or why . okay , maybe it's worse if you're the aggressor , but my point is that it's even if you are the defender _it's still wrong_ . and the other guy bringing up false moral equivalence - it's not about equivalence or better or worse . this isn't a game where the goal is to do slightly fewer war crimes than the other side so at the end you can say you were the "" good guys ."" if you are an ethical person , the goal is to never do any war crimes period . maybe sometimes it is an unattainable goal because of accidents and misfires and bad apples in the rank and file , but when we are talking about a decision to _intentionally_ commit war crimes on a massive scale , that all goes out the window . any argument in the vein of "" but they were worse "" when it comes to a decision to commit war crimes _intentionally_ is just deflection . because "" they were worse "" is not a justification for committing war crimes . i think you guys have drunk too much of the kool aid when it comes to hiroshima and nagasaki . it's similar to why people in russia are eating up so much of putin's nonsensical propaganda right now . it isn't because they are dumb , it's because no one wants to believe that their people are/were ethically in the wrong ."
14687,it would likely come out eventually . the belgians were the victors on congo but their atrocities came out over time . you can hide the disappearance of 6 million jews . plus the nazis literally planned to murder all of eastern europe and enslave a good bit of western europe . the holocaust was the warm up . someone would look back and figure out why the jews and eastern europeans disappeared . some crimes are objectively horrific and once people learn of them they recognize it as such . there is a limit to the victor writing history .
14688,"> yeah , nobody wants to die so you deep down theory is bullshit heh"
14689,"mariupol is what happens when you know you are in combat with an enemy that does not respect the geneva conventions or the respect afforded a surrendering soldier . in mariupol they knew that surrender entailed torture , rape , and murder . surrender becomes harder to demand when your tactics against prisoners are widely known ."
14690,"> as we have seen in this war , armies would rather retreat than risk it . that's sort of my point ( in part ). they'd usually rather take the opportunity to retreat than become trapped . > mariupol defenders fought to the last that's also partly my point . the trapped mariupol defenders fought valiantly , which is what you want your enemy to ** not ** do . i don't know how much of an opportunity they had to escape before being encircled , but occupiers will tend to be much more willing to retreat to escape being trapped than those motivated to defend their homeland . > and they ultimately surrendered and are being exchanged . the surrender of ~ 1,700 soldiers in mariupol was definitely the exception . but even then , more likely died before surrendering , and russia would've preferred if they retreated instead ."
14691,most of the fighting happening now is with [ artillery fired from miles away ]( rather than someone close enough to see a white flag .
14692,"ah . i was thinking of the potential scenario in which ukraine already made its way into crimea . in _that_ scenario , the bridge would be the only land connection ( though russia would likely still have naval connections )."
14693,"> not with this reactor design . it's got a negative void coefficient .... that means if the water stops flowing and it starts to heat up , eventually the water boils ... in this type of reactor , those bubbles actually slow down the reaction . i'm aware how a pwr operates , i'm saying that only stops the nuclear reaction , the rods that contain nuclear fuel doesn't loose heat just because you stop the reaction . you have to deal with this by constantly dumping water and removing steam . if these pumps ( that are operated on regular power ) can't be operational because of power failure you can't cool the rods . eventually the water evaporated leaving the rods in air when they start melting . now almost all water is vapor and the reactor vessel is in danger of a hydrogen explosion . the heat is so strong is separates the hydrogen and oxygen molecules . hydrogen is extremely flammable and this is what happened on the roofs of fukushima reactors . that's also a pressurized water reactor like the vver in zaporizhia . > in neither case would the reactor melt down or explode . i think you don't understand how nuclear reactors generate heat , and that heat stays after you stop the nuclear reaction . just like a car engine is still hot after you turned the car off . it's the same thing basically . this heat doesn't just go away . you need to pump water on it , especially after a emergency shutdown . shutting down a reactor rapidly is a very hard and stressful procedure . doing it with a kalashinkov over your head it's a dangerous scenario"
14694,"you have shifted to completely different angle than in the comment i replied to . the original argument was "" it's okay because it avoided even worse thing "", not "" it's okay because the other guys did even worse "". the latter is bogus that i never defended . the former is harsh reality . of course it's always terrible that people die , but when the only other options you have left are even worse , it's justifiable . the aggressor always has a choice to simply walk away and not kill anyone . the defender's closest equivalent would be surrendering without fight . in case of ww2 , that would still mean millions dying because axis was just that fucked up . sometimes , all options you have are fucked-up and all you can do is choose the one that is the least fucked-up ."
14695,"because ateocities were never socially accepted as normal . you just need to wrap them into some context that is widely accepted - like a religion . look at the horrors the church has done for 100s of years , it all eventually came out and yet people are still fine with all of it i dont believe there is a limit to human cruelty , you just have to put it in the right wrapper that will be easily acceptable"
14696,so you really ignore the rest of the argument because i agreed with you on one front ? pathetic .
14697,"> the rods that contain nuclear fuel doesn't loose heat just because you stop the reaction . true , but they aren't going to explode . you have to get enough heat generated to burst the cladding , and even then some of the generated hydrogen is absorbed by zinc materials in the assembly . if the fuel gets hot enough to slump , most likely it will simply travel down the fuel assembly and solidify . chances of any generated hydrogen/oxygen forming enough of a gas charge to burst the containment vessel are very low , especially because we're already theorizing there's too little water in the vessel anyway and the core is exposed . worst case , corium will pool in the bottom of the reactor vessel and form a molten puddle . oh , and if the reactor actually does an emergency shutdown , then none of this actually happens . the emergency core cooling system includes boron in the water it pumps in , which acts as a neutron poison and kills any remaining reaction . there's still heat , but the emergency cooling system is designed to keep up and keep the fuel cool enough so it doesn't become damaged by heat and can be restarted later . if you want to read more about the failure modes of the vver-1000 reactors as are installed as zaporizhizhia , check out this document : a simple summary is that while the reactors can melt down , they're designed to contain the melt down and not release or spread radiation . they're nothing like chernobyl , and if they had a sudden catastrophic event like fukushima they'd have roughly the same result ... molten core material staying inside the reactor vessels , no explosions and relatively little local radiation release . the sort of event you're thinking about where the reactor explodes and contaminates the countryside only happens with a runaway reaction , and this reactor type is designed to never allow that ."
14698,"i mean , people arent fine with it . some try to say it was a different time for some of the older atrocities like in the 1500s but a even then people arent fine with it . what germany and japan were doing was straight up understood to be wrong even in the 30s and 40s ."
14699,its because he kidnapped ukrainian orphans to be adopted by russian families . its a way of erasing their culture .

14716,i also made a list and put them on it . its titled big bad meanies im helping ! / s
14717,u.s . fails to hold its own accountable involved in human trafficking related to jeffery epstein . ftfy
14718,the us is the biggest distributor of violence and unnecessary evil . russia is just trying to keep up
14719,i wish there was a more neutral party making these claims .
14720,"yeah , but whenever usa puts countries on these lists it's just a reminder that usa don't recognize their faults in courts and lists them selves ."
14721,"well theres a lot more than that in our history , but id say residential school tops the list and using fake permits to force indigenous people to stay on reserves and starve is pretty much at the same level . thats just looking at numbers . ethically , its all bad but indigenous people have been put through generations of this hell not a few decades ."
14722,"let me begin by stating fuck russia . fuck putin . fuck this whole war . aite cool , let's go ... is the u.s also on this list ?"
14723,isn't ukraine like the center of the child pornography trade ? kinda ironic .
14724,"so what you're saying is , the us no longer finds it convenient to ignore some russian human rights abuses ."
14725,is not there human trafficking at the us southern border ?
14726,i guess us has human trafficking competition now
14727,i didn't even kno prince andrew was russian
14728,"human trafficking , child soldiers , classic russia"
14729,did they run out of geriatric soldiers ?
14730,"gonna guess this does nothing and has no impact on anything what so ever and add it to the very large useless "" look we are doing things !"" pile"
14731,where this guy have been when the terrorist groping in ethiopia tplf uses small kids as a solider . hypocrites actually the us and allies helping the terrorist group n its not surprising .
14732,why they dont do it in our own borders !
14733,being put on a u.s . government list is a badge of honor . why bestow that on russia ?
14734,is that a threat to russia ? i bet that's a threat to russia .
14735,on the list and so what ??
14736,"derrrr , omg guys i heard bad russians sometimes eat the babies of good ukrainians , durrrrrr"
14737,"im curious as so to what good are these lists , between these mixed with some good old fashioned war crimes what do they expect to come of it . the russian people dont seem to care that much , the counties who still deal with russia dont care and two years after the war finally ends the west wont care . now i would like to think that there are deep holes dug for these criminals but we all know that is not the case ."
14738,fuck u thats bulshit
14739,"and that's probably the ' lucky ' ones . there are many undocumented , and there are others in literal russian forced labor camps . it's totally surreal how much of our american school curriculum is built around literature of wwii concentration camps . "" never again . now we know what to look for ."" well guess what no one is talking about happening under our noses . what have we learned ? they'll free those concentration camps one day and we'll get the full report . it just seems like from day 1 were taught as a species to not to commit war crimes ."
14740,ethnic cleansing even .
14741,"that's called "" genocide ."""
14742,"not "" he "", but "" they "". putin didn't lift a finger to do any of this , he just signed off on it ."
14743,"fits the literal definition of genocide , as set out by the geneva convention ."
14744,> its because he kidnapped ukrainian orphans to be adopted by russian families . its a way of erasing their culture . that kinda sounds like canada . wonder if they ever got put on that list .
14745,what about epstein island
14746,that's legit what their rhetoric is . always chase anti-truth . almost like it comes straight from kgb doctrine . wait ...
14747,""" russia's fighting child soldiers """
14748,"it should be a reminder to everybody that if you let your tyrannical government fuck you over , it will if you can't stop the tyranny and don't want to give your life up for freedom or your rights , get the hell out of dodge"
14749,mortem ad tyranis
14750,"back in 2010 the future of russia looked great . if they had brought themselves closer to the west and integrated themselves in national trade , i have no doubt their standard of living would be excellent....instead ..."
14751,you're simply describing the tragedy of war . which is a human condition tragedy sadly .. didn't start nor will end in ukraine
14752,the whataboutism levels are off the charts
14753,"no one needs any excuses , the usa has the largest group of forced labor in the world inside of their prison system . why aren't we on the list ?"
14754,"i mean , the us \* is \* doing to the mexicans a lot of what russia is doing to the ukranians . it's almost like the asshole that started with an anti-immigrant campaign in 2016 was taking orders from putin ."
14755,whatever whatever russia do what it wants russia rolls with like 5 gangs geopolitically speaking this is a regime acting like a maury povich troubled teen
14756,without nuclear weapons we'd be fighting in ww5 by now .
14757,what does that have to do with the price of best bread ?
14758,"ok , solid proof or you're full of shit . this kind of thing you can't just comment without providing source inb4 some random telegram chat message"
14759,"source ? i believe you , but i wanna be on the side of truth , not propaganda edit : meant to say , "" i wanna believe you """
14760,seriously ? i havent read anything about this . though its not shocking .
14761,you mean relatively ? conscription age is 18 in most of the world
14762,another one lol . how many more but whatabout the us comments are you going to make on this thread ?
14763,yeah because america has relatively high ages for those things
14764,you think the us government is engaging in human trafficking ?
14765,this is on a whole different scale
14766,"uhh , the usa definitely doesnt participate in those two"
14767,literal soviet style whataboutism . * slow clap *
14768,good old soviet propaganda tactic ... but but what about usa
14769,makes sense why russia wants it so bad
14770,ukraine has been a hub of sex trafficking for decades but somehow doesn't make the list . really makes you think .
14771,well technically you can be a soldier in the us armed forces and still not be eligible to drink a beer because you aren't considered an adult . russia has always been a harsh and tough place . hence the massive vodka consumption thing .
14772,"not government sponsored . in fact , the u.s . government puts a ton of resources into fighting it ."
14773,"it seems there's only countries on this list . ethiopia is on tier 2 watch list . i believe house resolutions are passed for separatist/rebel/terrorist group activities : >"" in addition to the resolution , tplf must end the use of child soldiers , pull its forces from amhara and end its alliance with ola-""shene "", an armed rebel faction of the oromo liberation army . rep . karen bass led the resolution . she is part of the congressional us-ethiopia caucus and was the first african-american woman to serve as speaker for the california state assembly ."
14774,they're great for good pr for western regimes that badly need a boost to moral authority
14775,we might never get a full report . russians aren't as meticulous with their paperwork as the germans .
14776,wait until you hear about 1m uighurs .
14777,"> what have we learned ? we are not doing it , so i guess one can say that we learned from it . meanwhile in russia ..."
14778,this is a bad comparison afaik the russians aren't exterminating civilians systematically in death camps . no fan of the current russian regime but the nazi and ww2 comparisons are weak sauce .
14779,"with the worlds largest population of incarcerated individuals i think the u.s should look at itself before it points fingers . you have people slaving their whole lives away behind walls "" working "" for simple things like tv rights and such . the american prison system does not have moral high ground over russia and china ."
14780,what do you call the mass incarceration of people who here in the us ? no country imprisons more of its own people than the us .
14781,whataboutery > the technique or practice of responding to an accusation or difficult question by making a counter-accusation or raising a different issue . also called whataboutism .
14782,"i had a rant but it fits under your comment better hi i'm just a friendly canadian from friendly old canada . i grew up on a friendly little street across from the swamp where we made the china men live because they weren't allowed to live anywhere else . we forced them to mine coal because that was the only job we let them have , and paid them way less . when the war started we shipped them off into camps and stole all their stuff . then there were the residential schools . and the hospital that still sterilizes native mothers without asking them . yup . oh , canada ."
14783,"don't forget australia , officially started in 1905 and didn't stop until the 70s . that being said there are people who say , quite rightly , that it never really stopped , it just got re-branded"
14784,"stolen generation :( one of the tiktokers i follow , shina novalinga , talked about it"
14785,"wait , its all russia ?"
14786,q has the kgbs dna all over it . we just need to shine a blacklight on it
14787,except it's not that easy to just get out . i know several russians who've been trying for several years but visas aren't exactly easy to get . even less so now .
14788,"yea but one mans tyrannical government is another mans bastion of freedom . take the us for example . the far right wants an authoritarian demagogue to suppress everyone who isnt a white christian male and force them to live under their christian sharia state where they write the laws based off of their "" religion "". thats paradise for them , not tyranny . the far left wants everyone to be treated equally under the law and use the power of a democratically elected federal government to force everyone to play by the same rules no matter how wealthy they are . the far right considers that to be tyranny . we cant even agree on the definition of tyranny ."
14789,' let ' i'd like to see you overthrow putin big man .
14790,> back in 2010 thats just two years after russian invasion in georgia .
14791,"putin became a dictator in 2014 , and before that he was a nice guy with whom it is convenient to trade , right ?"
14792,> back in 2010 the future of russia looked great . not really . by that time it was already becoming obvious we were fucked . we just didn't realize the scale .
14793,"from the article it sounds like it's less the russian army directly , and more their lpr/dpr proxies in east ukraine that are using child soldiers . given they have been reported to have extended the draft to anyone under the age of 65 and removed most medical exceptions , they are clearly desperate for manpower . so in that context using teenagers to man check points sounds plausible ."
14794,"i've seen claims of 16-17 year old russians fighting in ukraine , and it's hard to confirm independently but i've seen 2 videos purporting to show captured russians that looked about 16 to me ."
14795,can you really tell the difference between an 18 year old and a 15 16 or 17 year old ? lol . i think people think small child but teenagers are children as well
14796,i feel that people often forget how bad war is and then voluntarily jump head first into pointless wars .
14797,it's a large country . look at rates of forced labor and it's relatively low
14798,more like ww10
14799,doubt it . nukes or not globalization is a bitch and people love cheap foreign goods more than they love war .
14800,"you know...the child sex trafficking that god knows how many us politicians took part in...if i were to guess , that's probably what he is getting at . apples and oranges imo but still a touch ironic that the us is the list keeper ."
14801,you believing what a random stranger says on the internet without a source is the reason why the internet was a mistake .
14802,"of course its complicated , but weve allowed a ridiculous amount of bullshit from developing aggressor-countries for all the wrong reasons . and by allowing bullshit i mean , turning a blind eye to the type of behavior/activity this post is about"
14803,emotion is what separates us from russians
14804,for sure .
14805,"you're right . the us grooms kids by setting up booths in their high school career fairs so they can make the stupid decision to join over they're 18 it's better but not by much . and the whole us just accepts it . propaganda has brainwashed the majority of americans into thinking their wars are for "" freedom "". russia isn't the only one who lies to its citizens about the true reason behind wars"
14806,"child soldiers no , forced labor yes . see the 13th amendment of the usa's constitution , which nationalized slavery ."
14807,whats the minimum age to count as a child soldier ? doesnt the us let 16 year olds into its army ?
14808,a lot of putin sympathizers in this thread .
14809,"both groups are aided by the us govt to disrupt east africa since they are more of close to china than the us the us lost its credibility after libya , afgan , somalia , iraq , syria and palatine . no country is stable after the us soldiers touch it ."
14810,we're still finding bodies from that business in serbia and kosovo and bosnia back in the 90s . russia is over 60 times the size of old yugoslavia .
14811,thanks ibm !
14812,wait until you hear about the millions of mexican immigrants . and that's a bipartisan thing now ... biden has hardly done anything to stop ice after trump radicalized them .
14813,"> this is a bad comparison afaik the russians aren't exterminating civilians systematically in death camps . ... yet . but based on history , they're not far off ."
14814,"tldr : essay on the growth cycle of a concentration camp ah ah ah . ... pattern recognition and logic , my friend . in the life of a concentration camp , one doesn't find out what went on inside until after it's run its course as an institution . until then , nobody in the camp can share the ( literally ) gatekept information , especially if the people are being trafficked around tortured or systrmatically thrown in a pit .. like people have been known to do in labor camps .. during a war . ukranians got there by trafficking . look at the war crimes . separating millions of children and trafficking them .... i mean , the horse is very out of the barn that russians in power give ~ no ~ fucks ; ukranians are at animal extermination status , so i'm completely baffled as to where people are getting this trust that a labor camp is not going to be a playground from a sade novel . it's just in a cover up latency phase as a concentration is in its infancy . the pattern if you pay attention to history and the news = camps start out innocuous as possible . look ar china's uigyurs . look at wwii jews . it was revealed at the end and certainly not suspected by a great majority of the public and the world ."
14815,aren't we allowed to criticise all three countries now ?
14816,i knew i wouldnt have to scroll far to see someone say : but whatabout the us ?!
14817,"nice bit of whataboutery , someone else doing something bad doesn't make it good . if you were in court for raping and murdering a toddler do you think a good defence would be "" well russian soldiers do it all the time , why pick on me ?"""
14818,ah yes a brand new account complaining about anti-russia bias . how's the weather in moscow nowadays you fascist ?
14819,"so , what's your point ?"
14820,always has been . 
14821,did you know the anti-nuclear power sentiment in europe was influenced by the kgb ?
14822,theres not enough hand sanitizer in all of time and space ! even pre-pandemic for that black light exam
14823,lol it's not even that deep
14824,"yes , exactly . "" just leave "" as a solution is always a priviledged stance . there are always many people who just can't ."
14825,countries like georgia and few others are visa free for russians .
14826,"the evangelicals are one fraction of the right , but yeah"
14827,i suppose illegal invasions of iraq and afghanistan were ok ? if they were ok then in our eyes europe can burn for all we care .
14828,"i think it's more that up until that point , we were collectively still partaking in wishful thinking like in tom clancy's books , where post-soviet russia and the us were able to begrudgingly get along ."
14829,"to be fair , that could just be years of malnourishment from poverty ."
14830,"it's super infuriating to encounter the numerous people here who are anti war because its russia . it's certainly not because war is terrible , because they don't seem to understand the terrible things they bring up happens every war ."
14831,"fuckin hell , meant to say "" i wanna believe you "", the whole point of the post was to ask for the source , as the very first word i said indicated . let's not be dramatic ."
14832,"i mean , the whole "" they have the majority of the nukes we don't own on the entire planet aimed at our head "" thing makes it hard to do much at all to directly intervene ."
14833,playing world police never ends well . everyone hates us but theyre always the first to ask for our help
14834,i willingly volunteered to serve my country and i never once saw a recruiter at my small high school . as a matter of fact i was a year out of school when i decided to join . freedom isn't free .
14835,trying to recruit young fit men to join the military when they reach adulthood isnt a bad thing in of itself lol .
14836,"i never saw a recruiter until after high school , just to throw my experience in with everyone else replying"
14837,"this is not true . the military is not legally allowed to recruit on primary school campuses . they haven't been able to since the 70's . there are rotc programs , which are ** way ** different because that is a college prep to officer training pipeline , and the student can leave before they turn 18 ."
14838,all countries do . otherwise no army
14839,"> doesnt the us let 16 year olds into its army ? 18 . still mentally a child imo but an adult legally . you're probably thinking of the high school program jrotc which is sponsored by our army , the children still haven't sold themselves over yet ."
14840,to be deployed its 18
14841,17 with parental consent to enlist but most military enlistees have to have a minimum of a high school diploma or g.e.d .
14842,iirc 16 is the limit for regular troops and 18 for irregular .
14843,brainwashed russians . recently theyve been news about russian influencer being payed by their government to read some propaganda script . dystopian shit .
14844,"absolutely not , just pointing out how you superpowers act and pretend to be leading the world . maybe it's leading like poorly acted , outdated infomercial . edit : both nations play superpowers , the rest of us are just watching the show and it's as deadboring as baseball , without beer ."
14845,can you provide a source proving the us is arming either side ? the us has been vocal but i haven't seen military activities from them .
14846,correction : no country is stable after any foreign intervention . the usa is still more reliable on the global scale than many other countries
14847,lots of missing mass graves from the chechen war
14848,not everything in life is equivalent . mankind has been performing atrocities on itself throughout history . not everything is comparable
14849,"absolutely . none of them are saints . that's not the point though . look at what the person i responded to wrote . americans saying never again and projecting their own form of "" freedom "" is not preferable when the u.s is just as bad as the countries it claims high ground over ."
14850,"only pro russia people seems to be anti-nuclear energy , so it makes sense"
14851,its not like you can just show up unannounced and start living there .
14852,"nope they weren't . same with georgia , chechnya and now ukraine . not a zero sum game . stop spreading these dogwhistles ..."
14853,"afghanistan was sanctioned by the un and was a legal intervention acting under article 51 of the un charter , which recognises the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs , and requires states to report such actions immediately . > in december 2001 , the united nations security council established the international security assistance force ( isaf ) to oversee military operations in the country and train the afghan national security forces . at the bonn conference in december 2001 , hamid karzai was selected to head the afghan interim administration . iraq was illegal . none of this has anything to do with russian unilateral invasion and annexation of sovereign territory of its neighbour . stop the lazy whataboutery ."
14854,"doesn't malnourishment actually make you look older , not younger ?"
14855,absolutely . russia's war is pointless . fighting it is not . it's ironic .
14856,"im talking about highly developed countries as a whole , not just the us ."
14857,graduated in 98 never saw a recruiter at my school . did they start showing up after 9-11 ?
14858,free dumb cost a buck o 5 .
14859,propaganda is a very good tool . it convinces those who serve the warmongers that they're patriots instead of murderers
14860,perhaps that should wait until they're actually adults and ready to make decisions that could be life-or-death though ?
14861,"you might want to read the text of the no child left behind act , specifically section 9528 . it explicitly requires public schools to give military recruiters access to students at school if they receive no child left behind funds . its successor , the every student succeeds act didn't change that access . military recruiters have been allowed for over 20 years and schools cannot refuse them . edit : you mention primary schools and that may be true . but high schools are secondary school , not primary school ."
14862,they arent allowed to leave/deploy before 18 though
14863,must be nice that people dont beg your country for help when they are being invaded or oppressed . you get to just sit back and drink your brews and criticize . must be nice .
14864,"sure russia does this thing but according to a source i made the fuck up , the us does it too ! arent all superpowers bad! "
14865,** soviet ** ** style ** ** whataboutism **
14866,none of this countries you mentioned are stable coz of the us they are stable coz they are not invaded by the us .
14867,tell me one after one country that is stable after the us intervention
14868,"i get your point and i'm just as critical of american use of prisons that are effectively a slave labour force as anyone but op's criticism still stands for example look at me , i smoke and take recreational drugs but i still told my kids that smoking will kill you and drugs can mess you up . it's hypocritical but still good advice ."
14869,"no one ever said that comrade . hope you are at least paid well to be here , it must be pretty miserable ."
14870,aw sweet a schizo thread
14871,"that just isnt accurate at all , lmao , what planet are you living on ?"
14872,"not exactly . malnourishment delays puberty and decreases final height . for people living in extreme malnourishment and who are already past puberty , yes , it totally makes people look older , but for teens , the effect is often the opposite ."
14873,"graduated in 2004 after 9/11 obviously , big high-school still no recruiters ."
14874,"93 here , maybe it changed after 9/11 , i don't know . all i do know is there are plenty of people willing to volunteer outside of high school still and without ever even seeing a recruiter until they decide to join . the fact they said groom leads me to believe someone should take a look at their search history . project much maybe ?"
14875,graduated in 13 only remember seeing an actual recruiter once or twice during all 4 years of high school and all they did was set up a table during lunch . never went around trying to talk students into enlisting just sat to the side and let people who were already interested about joining come to them .
14876,"graduated 2016 , only time i saw them was at "" career fairs "" in the gymnasium once a year people only talked to them to get free lanyards and water bottles lol"
14877,"they were in all 3 high schools i went to , it's a very real thing . my brother was romanced by the idea of fighting for his country . we're still young , and all he has to show for it is endless nightmares and severe social anxiety ."
14878,"i don't know if it was universal , but they were in mine in the 2000s . don't know about at career fairs because i never went to those , but they'd sometimes set up in the cafeteria ."
14879,its a hefty fuckin fee
14880,you only win war by killing people . the u.s isnt the only military that kills people lol . i cant believe you typed that out
14881,"i helped put an end to the bosnian genocide , you're welcome !"
14882,"tbh it probably was better that al-qaedas ability to engage in attacks on the scale of 9/11 . its probably better that for 20 years the people of afghanistan were able to experience relative peace and a massive expansion of human rights . its probably better that saddam hussein was no longer able to engage in massive destructive wars with his neighbors , as well as committing another genocide . its * probably * better that serbia was unable to finish its genocide in bosnia and start another one in kosovo . its * probably * better that gaddafi wasnt able to destroy benghazi . but for all that good , have you considered that war is bad ? have you considered muh goat herders ?"
14883,"i mean , it's not like the risks of joining the military aren't readily apparently to everyone ."
14884,i knew i was forgetting something .
14885,that guy lives in iceland . believe it or not they dont even have a military lol . the second they get in conflict with anyone their dead
14886,"hey , you must not get informed a lot . how about checking your american history and that hague and more courts ."
14887,""" narrow minded , single pov , little traveled , non listening , indoctrinated princess ""#"
14888,"some were once invaded . i thought you said "" intervention "" which is different to invasion"
14889,"there's a few . especially ones from the former ussr . also vietnam is stable . south korea , japan , etc any such luck with interventions by mother russia ?"
14890,i'm not trying to point out whatabaoutism or hypocrisy here . the u.s is in no position morally to lecture or impose their version of freedom on other countries . the never again reference op made implies that the u.s should do something to stop what he refers to as concentration camps abroad . replacing a flawed system with one equally bad isn't going to help anyone .
14891,poor guy cant even get french fries anymore
14892,yeah you just keep trying to figure things out little buddy .
14893,"yeah , it stunts growth more than any other factor aside from genetics/diseases . lack of sleep is another one , the process of sleep is incredibly important to growing in kids for some reason ."
14894,graduated around the same time and they were in mine . guess it varied by place .
14895,yet this is a bad thing when applied to one's own government that's purposely destroying the country . interesting .
14896,"i mean , it's not like people without fully-formed brains think they're invincible ."
14897,"in modern times we've gone head to head trawlers against warships over fish , twice . google cod wars , let's weigh balls after ."
14898,topped off with a word salad . fuckin ' classy . did you go to jordan peterson's school of debate ? jesus tap dancing christ .
14899,hahaha . vietnam.us only won that war in hollywood movies . sure .. communism . works for so many countries cuba is stable coz us unable to invade china is superpower coz the us cannnot invade .
14900,i'm not that easy ya fuckin fruit . enjoy the asylum
14901,still doesnt refute my point . they dont get deployed until are adults . they arent child soldiers . enough with the whataboutism .
14902,that was almost 60 years ago but i actually didnt know . but what happens when a new conflict arises with all the technology and wmd that there are now
14903,"like the automatic rapid fire of nonsense accusations , fine trolling . bit bland but , ok . i know you have it in you , like throbbing cock , to finish strong , so let's have it ."
14904,"oh yeah the terrible asylum , where the church bells ring and make me come down with the vapours . you're as easy as i say you are clownboy ."
14905,"it's not whataboutism , it's directly on topic . you started out talking about recruiting young , fit men . i'm talking about recruiting being done too young . you're right that they're not deploying , but many of them are all but committing to do so before they're even 18 . they're being sold an idealized image of the military when they're young and impressionable . there's a reason a lot of companies aren't allowed to advertise to people under 18 , why should the military be exempt ?"
14906,"... dude , that's just you guys , are you the bad guys ?"
14907,"were the bad guys depending on where youre from . youre gonna hate the u.s if youre from the middle east unless you happen to be israel , egypt , or saudi arabia . when you have the greatest military force and amount of allied countrys , the other countries that dont have much will hate you . that goes for china , russia , and north korea"
14908,russia is in heavy drunk driving mode . sort of unconsciously making the moves but in an incoherent way . these moves would make sense if they had the upper hand and were winning .
14909,russia doing ussr things !
14910,"and it begins again ... so called "" re-education "" camps . remove the ukrainian culture and truth ."
14911,"this war russia wages as many previous ones including holodomor ( man made famine in 1932 ) are all about the stolen history of kyiv rus . for those looking to learn more about ukraine - check "" ukraine and the united states "" e-book - the facts may surprise you . ( it's on all major e-book platforms it seems )."
14912,"god this is so fucked up . taking land , deporting ukrainians against their own will off their own land , destroying everything in their path , stealing everything that's not already destroyed , raping those unable to flee , and much much more ... when will all this end ? this is ethnic cleansing and genocide ... ** second major time this has happened in the last 100 years by the same aggressors !**"
14913,"so , more people for the resistance to car bomb ? seems russians in ukraine trying to run the show have a very short lifespan ."
14914,how is that supposed to work if they keep shooting misiles at schools in the first place ?
14915,hope theyre not hoping to stay for too long... 
14916,doesnt the headline mirror desantis sending military to act as fla teachers to control what students learn
14917,sounds like murikkka's current goptaliban
14918,"some states in america are attempting to do the same by teaching two sides of the holocaust and not teaching subjects like slavery , and the sciences ."
14919,sounds like what the gop is trying to do
14920,teachers ? they used to call them political officers . these guys are really winding back the hands of time
14921,cute that russia thinks it can hold any ground for any period of time in ukraine . their commanders are all cowards and will be eliminated by himars :)
14922,did they really think that they will hold that land for long ?
14923,like china like russia . they always want to indoctrinate innocent kids .
14924,how very republican of them .
14925,hey ... taking a page from gop playbook .
14926,sounds like another version of what florida and other red states are doing to teachers .
14927,geez . just like here in the land of oppressive bullshit .
14928,"who do they think they are , the gop ?"
14929,that makes sense . they already sent a bunch to florida .
14930,sounds like they also send some one to florida to control what children learn .
14931,"ruling bodies push their views on those they rule , it's so typical it's hardly newsworthy concerning this is about russia ."
14932,russia did not just kill your families and destroy your villages . that was ukranians .
14933,"theyll obviously need to be arrested and thrown in jail if caught but theyll likely just flee in advance of the ukrainian army . illegal immigration , working without visas , failure to remit taxes , teaching without proper credentials , the charges will all add up ."
14934,"reason russia exhumed graves says "" checkmate "" putin ."
14935,dude in the polyester uniform and dish plate hat trying to look like the master race .
14936,jesus . are we really heading towards ww3 ?
14937,all fun and games until the students catch on and the teacher is trapped with them ...
14938,why bother sending teachers ? i feel like their online propaganda has been pretty successful in the us and europe .
14939,"too bad russian teachers are so well educated , they don't even teach nor know about stalin's and hitler's pact . i'd rather expect for those "" teachers "" that they'll be taught a few lessons instead ."
14940,what is this florida ?
14941,yea ... that's what china and russia like to do ....
14942,"i hate it when a big government controls what the children of a country learn , especially when they use it to indoctrinate .. keep the russian federal government out of education !!!"
14943,"and if they didn't do this , we would have an article about how "" russia is depriving children in occupied areas of an education "". let's be honest here ."
14944,"i know how to _fabricate_ news about there being a famine ... the soviet union had no reason to make the _entire world have a famine all at once_ . even if the famine only affected the ussr , it's still not a genocide since a genocide targets one specific ethnic group ."
14945,"sounds like their on the same road as the us of a , too bad"
14946,"is because in their minds they are winning , they belive in their own propaganda"
14947,i'm genuinely waiting for putin to declare russia the new ussr . probably will whenever they absorb belarus .
14948,why ukraine and the united states though ? is this one of those it was all the cia stories ?
14949,"not manmade , if it was manmade it wouldn't affect the rest of the world . how can you _fabricate_ a famine ? show up with a comically large spoon and eat all the grain ? let me tell you who fabricates famines , the us . they literally throw out extra food when prices fall too much , in order to decrease supply , increase demand and make prices go up . how come the more khazak people died in the 1933 famine yet it's a genocide if ukrainians ? how come plenty of russians also died ? india isn't even part of the soviet union yet bengali people starved to death too . read the report by michel ellman about the famine , it's the most recent and accurate one ."
14950,russia yearning for a ron desantis .
14951,"woah , really ?"
14952,indoctrinators
14953,"no , using a page from their own russian playbook . desantis can be bad and russia can still be on a completely different level . this is just like when the russians try and go "" well , mcdonalds bad too !"" in regards to tasty and that's all's moudly buns and running out of fries ."
14954,not newsworthy ? what team are you on ?
14955,lol you've been downvoted by people who think you think that . poes law strikes again .
14956,that was russia
14957,"by bringijg puppets to give a false education , they're doing that anyway ."
14958,pull putins boot out of your mouth before you lie your ass off next time .
14959,"gish gallop . i had to look it up . i was like pish dash ? i couldn't remember . you only need one argument . that it's false or that it happened , but it wasn't technically a genocide . when you're in denial it means your group identity doesn't align with your self image . it creates cognitive dissonance . i think a psychopath would be able to actually manage a convincing narrative . so that's good for you that you're struggling but sorry you have cognitive dissonance . my friend is ukrainian jew and part of his family died in the holodomor ."
14960,it is more about to show what contributions ukrainians did to the us development . the story of george kistiakowsky and the crucial role he played in creating the first us atomic bomb is arguably the most memorable one .
14961,do you prefer the kgb stories ?
14962,"you must be blind to the current news from ukraine to ask questions like "" how can you fabricate a famine "". you forcefully remove all the grain from people . encircle them with troops so they cannot go anywhere . watch them die . the man who coined the very term "" genocide "" dr . lemkin said in 1953 : "" what i want to speak about is perhaps the classic example of soviet genocide , its longest and broadest experiment in russification the destruction of the ukrainian nation . the third prong of the soviet plan was aimed at the farmers , the large mass of independent peasants who are the repository of the tradition , folklore and music , the national language and literature , the national spirit , of ukraine . the weapon used against this body is perhaps the most terrible of all starvation . between 1932 and 1933 , 5,000,000 ukrainians starved to death . ** the crop that year was ample to feed the people and livestock of ukraine **, though it had fallen off somewhat from the previous year , a decrease probably due in large measure to the struggle over collectivization . but a famine was necessary for the soviet and so they got one to order , by plan , through an unusually high grain allotment to the state as taxes. find the whole speech . read . think . stop spreading the moscow propaganda ."
14963,"if you can't think of a single way of fabricating a famine , you're clearly not very smart and therefore your opinion is worthless ."
14964,"people wont believe anything that goes against their narrative . dont bother . my granddad almost died as all his region was starving to death(povoljie ), yet man made famine was created to kill ukrainians . perfecto . makes sense"
14965,"he's talking about the last time russians did this . but you're right , the modern day russian nazis aren't quite as evil as the original nazis they emulate . yet ."
14966,"i heard a similar one . why would anything be newsworthy in war . russia just bombed a shopping mall - who cares , ukraine bombs russians too "
14967,i'll rephrase the above : how tf is anyone surprised russia is pushing their views through any means possible ? it's literally the one thing they're known for other than being a gas station - russification and imperialism .
14968,"i think they are just emphasising not to be surprised with "" news "" that russia is ramping up its political propaganda as it is a typical kremlin thing to do . not that it is not important ."
14969,i'm glad one or two of you understood my special military comment .
14970,"he's making a joke about what these russian "" teachers "" are going to tell the ukrainian kids ."
14971,the soviets contributed to the atomic bomb too . their spies stole information that helped them build their own !
14972,"that seems like an oddly slanted way to study ukrainian history , tho i guess it could be of interest to americans ."
14973,"you will get nowhere accusing anyone who disagrees with you of le propaganda . more importantly perhaps , it is worth noting that the famine being characterised as intentional is * very * controversial in academia , and more and more arent considering it a genocide anymore . the fact that the potential yield was reduced by > 9 million tonnes due to flooding and rust ( the fungal disease ) and soviet aid sent to ukraine may have helped this"
14974,"every other fact you mentioned is false . first off the turks were the first ( armenian genocide ), 2nd off 5m is the total number of people , out of which less than 2m were ukrainans . most were khazak , and other minorities . there was plenty of mismanagement of crops by the kulaks , they burned their crops when they were forced to sell them ( sell , not forefit ). they literally used slave labour , collectivisation meant the worker would own the farm they worked on , not some rich asshole . you ahve provided zero sources for your false claims , my source is the 1933 soviet famine paper by michel ellman ( a historian not a redditor ) pleas tell me , _why the fuck would the soviet union need a famine_ ? capitalism needs famine to lower supply , in planned economies all state farms get a quota they must meet . kulaks made that harder because they were independent ."
14975,it is wrong that i think of over 10 ways to create a famine ?
14976,"sending in teachers isn't quite the same as psysically destroying cities and killing the inhabitants , no ?"
14977,hey theyre stealing our ( us ) gig !
14978,"if there was a non-woosh award , i would give it to you right now ."
14979,that's not contribution that's just theft
14980,i was wondering when you were getting around to denying the holodomor .
14981,"i quoted to you the most authoritative person on the subject , but you continue your propaganda . you are either truly not very smart as another person concluded about you previously , or just selling your conscience for the rubles ."
14982,"you need to read someone else if this is what you took from researching the holodomor . why did the soviet union need a famine ? to suppress ukranians and quash opposition . ethnic cleansing . it's because many opposed the collectivization you describe ; they were arrested , jailed , killed , starved . there wasn't a widespread famine , and no , the ukrainians didn't do it to themselves . good chunk of what you've shared is outdated and linked to russian distortions of the history . the grain was taken . why don't you try applebaum's red famine ? there are also dozens of pages on the subject , like at the holodomor museum , and a variety of other ukrainian sources ."
14983,russia does both . its called genocide .
14984,""" our gig "" - russia , probably . r/unexpectedcommunism"
14985,lol thanks mate . i thought your comment was on point .
14986,whos denying it ? when did i say the famine didnt happen ?
14987,"denialism is the last stage of genocide , though it often starts earlier . no such thing is planned - no such thing is happening - no such thing happened. "
14988,how is it propaganda to say the armenian genocide happened before the famine ?
14989,"they did not need one , they were paying with grain to foreigners . the famine was everywhere , my family was touched by it even though i am far from being ukrainian myself . try to read smth else besides bs like ukrinform or some other verified ukrainian sources ."
14990,"the killing part on the scale that's done in ukraine is genocide . the other is indoctrination at best , forced russification at the worst ."
14991,communism is when russia
14992,"you ... mean like actual historians like the one i listed ? and the controlled famines , because there were multiple , were a tool of control and punishment . you need to read historians who aren't knee-deep in russian revisionism and propagandasome of the worst lies about the holodomor came from a western sources like the new york times's walter duranty , who certainly was . a lot of history needs revisiting , especially if the primary sources are russian and the subject is crimes against humanity ."
14993,the goal of russification is to eradicate minority identities .
14994,"sure thing , buddy . sure thing . russian - bad , non russian - gold standard . got you . edit : oupsies ."
14995,no shit . i'm from lithuania and have quite a lot of examples of it in my social circle and have seen effects of russification first hand . i'm not quite sure what you're getting at ?
14996,"uh , yeah , when they lie about certain things and dozens of other cultures corroborate a different story ? i'm sure all of the post-soviet states came into a room one day and decided to lie about all the horrible things done to them . like , damn dude ."
14997,"i think the crux is some people want to use the term genocide because it is more evocative , and others don't think it qualifies so they don't want to sound over-uhh zealous ? over-something , there's a good adjective there somewhere . most people for the former tend to be a bit too emotionally invested , which causes people to not take them serious . whereas the latter are often way too armchair about it ; their analysis is skewed by never having even experienced a death , much less war that said i think it's fair to call it a genocide . it's more accurate than ' war crimes ' which is a really sterile way to describe the disgusting shit that happens . calling it that doesn't "" take away "" from "" real "" genocide victims like jews or tutsis etc , where the common consensus is that those were genocides . genocide isn't about comparing magnitudes ... it's more about intents . that said there needs to be a sufficient magnitude , and i think that there is more than enough ."

14999,"as someone who lives in sweden , i hope we can join nato ."
15000,"akaash asked too many questions , we only got 2 chat questions"
15001,wow its already been 5 months ?
15002,christ its been 5 months already ?
15003,predictions of long term effects of russian actions ?
15004,also if ukraine gives up that just teaches putin if he threatens people enough he can get his way . its devastating to the rest of the world .
15005,"what would be the potential issues that would occur if russia were to succeed over taking over ukraine . would it be similar to how crimea was run . also what do you think are the reasons for putin's interests in taking over the ukraine . is is due to nationalism , greed or pride over russian and soviet history that have driven these ambitions ."
15006,great format ! do you think this crisis is enough of a reason to accelerate the transition to greener ( an less dictatorship - backed ) sources of energy ? is the obligation to rely on nato and western government a proof that un is very unequipped for the challenges of today ?
15007,"how's the full embargo blocking of russian oil and gas coming along ? how has the rest of the eu given support , aid or training to ukraine since the first 3 weeks ?"
15008,how do you anticipate the change of leadership in the uk to impact nato response in ukraine ?
15009,slava ukraine . down with putin .
15010,"could you guys maybe talk about some of the economic consequences going forward ? gas prices , food shortages and so on ?"
15011,good afternoon !
15012,"as a russian i hate our government . they'll regret all they have done very soon , but it will cost russia's future"
15013,has ukraine made any significant gains since russia's redeployment/redistribution of forces a few weeks ago ?
15014,the thing with ukraine it's because it's smack middle of europe and important for the food .
15015,will russia be held accountable for all the war cimes
15016,has any officials form eu tried to find trough secret services or publicly any dialog partners in russia ?
15017,"do u see america or other nato allies stepping into this war in a physical way should prices for things ( gas , food , animal feed , etc ) remain high for say , a year or two and if so , should we expect to see china respond at that time as well or would we seem them doing the same in taiwan before then ?"
15018,wouldnt 5 months be 17 days from now ?
15019,"oh wow , this is a love , talking conversation . like a podcast"
15020,where do you see the war in the coming months ?
15021,woah
15022,"russia wouldnt handle any new opening fronts . they wasted too much money and people already , and given their actual military power , wont be able to hold for long ."
15023,all it takes is one mad man in power to destroy the world . at what point does the world draw the line of taking abuse from a country with nukes ?
15024,hi hi . what do you believe will happen to the poorer eastern european countries like slovakia and hungary ? will they come out of this crisis without significant damage ?
15025,does anyone believe that this will escalate to the highest us/nato threat since the cold war ?
15026,"a question that may sound quite stupid , once this war is over , could russia try to apply to join nato ?"
15027,would aleksandr dugin's adherent elements in the kremlin ever allow a less expansionist faction to gain traction in russia ?
15028,what else could the west be doing to bring the war to a close ? harsher sanctions ? what tools do we have left ? realistically or theoretically
15029,will you do this again . many unanswered questions
15030,do you feel the war might just end due to economic collapse in russia with the numerous sanctions that continue to be imposed instead of a military victory ?
15031,when can this all be over ?! will there ever be some peace between ukraine and russia ?
15032,"regarding theories of any governmental or presidential overthrow in russia or putin having to resign due to health reasons or whatever , i ask myself who would replace him and what is the chance that it's gonna lead to significant changes considering their current foreign policy - meckez and say what you what about putin , he has been able to hold together that huge nation , this makes me wonder if his replacement or successor will be strong enough to do so as well ."
15033,i'm russian-british and i wonder how long this war could go for ? i'm not excited to see my younger cousins to get drafted .
15034,"at what point does everyone think that some international body will create a "" coalition of the willing "" to break the russian blockade of ukrainian food shipments in order to stave off potentially millions of starvation deaths ?"
15035,"were all cheering on ukraine right now because of zelensky . what comes with the next president of ukraine , tho ?"
15036,how do assess the scope of rehabilitation of ukraine on economic grounds by the west when west is already paying a price .
15037,sometimes it be like that bruh
15038,don't y'all think zelensky's image is wayy too white washed ?
15039,russia will win
15040,"entire tory party is a russian plant , been saying it for months ."
15041,just want this to end so gas prices can go back to normal
15042,i really think this is going to end in a nuclear war unless ukraine surrenders . putin has made it clear that the only options are that russia successfully invaded ukraine or he will unravel a nuclear war . western leaders are not taking this seriously and its really frustrating .
15043,seems like they could have come to a compromise solution back in february without the war . the osce ceasefire monitoring showed an escalation prior to the war etc .
15044,i want ukraine to win but i think they will lose . sad times
15045,what do you think about turkeys political initiatives to bring russian and ukrainian counterparts for peace and ceasefire talks ?
15046,how likely is it to go to nuclear war ?
15047,im also swedish lol
15048,we hope you can as well . you will need it if he wins
15049,it's already been 8 years at this point
15050,nope . it will be 5 months on the 24th .
15051,"that's why we're having this talk ! we can't let off awareness of this important issue , so we're doing our ( small ) part to help with just that ."
15052,thats absolutely insane and inhumane ! prayers to the people and families who have been affected by the crisis 
15053,no it hasnt but it will be 5 months on the 24th .
15054,rise or ruse of the ruble .
15055,ukraine is russia's iraq . us attacked a sovereign nation unprovoked . look at the decay that took place inside the us . russia will probably track the same way .
15056,"there's like 8 avenues from which russia has always been invaded . most of these are too the west , so , presumably russia would keep pushing west , with nukes if need be since putin sees this as the last chance ( falling birth rates ) for russia to hold these places ( they can't really defend the mostly flat and open russia so they need these "" gates "". peter zeihan talks a lot about this"
15057,"its mainly so that say there is a war with the west , putin would have a way to block a lot of wheat exports and forcing the west into submission and also cause putin wants to restore the former soviet empire ."
15058,the full embargo is more like a partial embargo . still enough to cause absolute devastation on russia's economy . the aid the eu and america have given has finally started paying off in a big way as ukrainian soldiers are finishing their training on the artillery systems they've been given . that said there's still basically a stalemate in the donbas region .
15059,i don't know . look it up and report back . seem like easy questions to answer .
15060,i tend to agree with the future comment . i think this unprovoked attack into ukraine by putin will harm russia and russian culture for the next 50-75 years .
15061,"no , ukraine wasn't able to recapture any significant territories because big part ( about \~ 50 % by different reports ) of its offensive weapons ( armored vehicles , artillery ) is destroyed in combat . it is capable to do strong resistance to russian advancement due to defensive weapons supplied by allies , but ukraine does not have even fraction of weapons it needs to advance itself and recapture its territories . the reason are heavy losses during the past combats ; and destroyed industry and armory depots by russian missile attacks . this is why ukraine needs western help in heavy weapons so badly ."
15062,im not sure you know where europe is on a map .
15063,"potentially , whether nato are able to fine and hold putin and his allies responsible for war-crimes are in the air for now . but now due to decreasing support of putin from people outside and within russia , it seems that when the war ends , somebody will have to be held responsible ."
15064,this is the question of the day !!
15065,"france tried , but then was strongly rebuked . as the publicly released transcript between macron and putin showed , putin never had any intention of peace ."
15066,if this doesnt get answered would any other world analyst in the chat respond ?
15067,"6 months will be in 17 days ! we're actually a week or so late of the 5 month anniversary . but we want to ensure this topic is front and center , so better late than never ."
15068,yes . are you on your phone ( which os ) or browser ( firefox or chrome ?)
15069,"a bit like that . other subreddits also hold their own talks . if you are subscribed to one of these subs , you'll get a notification and see it on your feed ."
15070,thats the correct response ( in my opinion ) because 5 months is alot of time 
15071,"idk , there are a lot of mad mans in nato who destroyed the world"
15072,"the whole world is suffering the economic inpact of putin missadventure obviouly russia and ukraine the most but everyone feel a dregree of pain , some more than others even china said this there are intersting oportunities that may end benefitting east european countries long term"
15073,i kind of feel like it already has .
15074,it already has escalated to that level .
15075,"while nobody knows what "" the end "" looks like for this war , nato's purpose is to counter russia . so willing to wager russia will neither apply , nor be accepted if it did ."
15076,fun fact : the ussr once applied to join nato
15077,"if i'm not mistaken , russia applied not too long after the collapse of the ussr . not sure of the exact details though ."
15078,"time . russias military forces are hilariously small in numbers , id bet 60 to 70 % are already deployed in ukraine . given they wont last for years , deserting and whatnot , how long could this last ?"
15079,"1 . total ban on russian oil and gas ( theoretic , because germany decided that nuclear was bad ) 2 . more heavy weapons delivered faster ( realistic ) 3 . convoys for ukrainian grain blockaded by russia ( realistic ) - may not speed up the resolution of the war , but will help the already massively struggling ukrainian economy , and reduce the massive risk of world hunger ."
15080,we will ! we have been covering ukraine almost every month .
15081,after the first month it sounded like most of the issues with refugee flow got sorted .
15082,russia really desires ukraine i guess
15083,"no , because europe is still financing the war effort by buying russian energy ."
15084,i dunno maybe 1-2 years ?
15085,i think western leaders and ukraine need to start negotiating . that is the only way the war will end . continuously pushing aggression will end the world by nuclear war .
15086,hold together that nation to what end ? this has and will continue to be a disaster for russia . the only end for humanity is unity . today russia acts against that by denying the people what they desire - unity .
15087,"rofl . putin skullfucked that entire nation and only held it "" together "" through force and economic manipulation . they were a pretty shitty country to begin with and he just skullfucked their economy and geopolitical position and has gotten tens of thousands of troops killed so far . that really doesn't sound like holding shit together ."
15088,maybe the wikipedia page can help with some of those questions some interesting people there
15089,"most citizens are very happy , the rouble has ** risen ** in value against the usd and euro by almost % 40 . it is set to become one of the highest appreciating currencies this year . crazy right ? so you can imagine how happy the citizens holding roubles must be ."
15090,"as is popularly known there are neo-nazis roaming the us ( as with many other countries ). with this information , would it be just to invade the us and kill innocent civilians in the process of finding these small groups of nazis and eradicating them ? this de-nazification of ukraine is simply a lazy excuse to invade the country ."
15091,"im not a journalist , but a russian expat who has been following the news very closely ( both the western and russian version of events ). i think the most insidious type of propaganda is the kind that takes a small real fact , but then completely twists it and blows it out of proportion to present a completely false larger narrative . from what i have gathered : - are some members of azov battalion neo-nazi ? yes - are all of them ? no - was it wrong if ukraine to legitimize azov ? yes and no . yes , because neo-nazis . no , because azov and other militia groups essentially saved ukraine during the first russian invasion , when ukraine had no army to speak of . this also served to de-radicalize the battalion and its moments over time . - are there no nazis in ukraine??!!!1 of course there are nazis in ukraine , just like there are in every country in the world - is ukraine ruled by nazis ? absolutely not . there are a ton of western countries who have fringe ultra-nationalist movements , both in forms of militia and government parties . ukraine actually had less ultra-nationalist representation in the parliament than many other european nations . - did russia attack ukraine to de-nazify ? absolutely not - see the point above . the ultra-nationalist/neo-nazi is a fringe movement and represents a tiny sliver of ukrainian population . i would wager that the usa has more neo-nazis per capita than ukraine , and we have a concerning growth of armed fat-right militias that were already classified as extremist organizations by other countries . this doesnt mean the rule the usa ( at least not yet ), and this doesnt mean that american citizens who oppose them would welcome a military invasion to de-nazify the country - are ukrainians as a whole more radicalized against russians now , after the beginning of this last invasion ? of course ! just like the soviets were radicalized against the germans during and after ww2 . so this has become a self-fulfilling prophesy . edited to address your last point about bias . yes , the prevailing western narrative , especially in social media / reddit is definitely very biased in favor of ukrainian narrative at the moment , and especially so in the first couple of months of the recent invasion . this is the problem with the concept of moral clarity . ukraine is objectively on the right side of things , but it doesnt mean that everything ukraine says should be taken as the 100 % truth ."
15092,"even if a single battalion does have those elements does it justify murdering civilians ? who are the bigger nazis ? ukraine azov battalion of 10,000 or russian military of 200,000 ?"
15093,if you really want to know more about azov : [ ps i am not sure how you can say it's difficult to get objective information . you are on reddit which means you have access to pretty much anything . pps i grew up in ukraine and have family and friends there . you can always ask me
15094,"yes , there are nazi's in ukraine , but no more than any other country , there are probably some in belarus . so technically not a myth , however it's use as a casus belli for invasion is the myth especially when russia is using the wagner group in it's operations ."
15095,"ukrainian here . nazi stuff is a massive lie ( or at least , it is now ) of course , there are some people who hold this belief , but there are people like that everywhere . if we're talking about problems in ukraine's philosophies , then it would be more truthful to say that ukraine has far-right problem ( or "" we vs them "" to be specific )."

15103,"that is possible . i hope ukraine drives them off , but to be honest , i worry the war will last for years . a war between two very corrupt capitalist governments who send average working-class people to die . the longer the war of russian aggression and imperialism goes , the more ukraine will have to give up to western imperialist powers in order to maintain support . i just hope in all this that ukraine can remain independent as much as possible , and that ukrainians can have their right to self-determination ."

15110,wha 8 years ?!
15111,"this is the excuse given to the russian people about why ukraine and crimea are important . the real reason is the same as it always is . money . ukraine were developing the oil and gas fields around crimea and ramping up gas production to supply western europe , in direct competition to gazprom . further , in the donbas , ukrainian mineral surveys have found a huge lithium deposit . prior to the invasion , plans were being drawn up and contracts prepared for western mining companies such as glencore to begin construction on what would become europe's first lithium mine , bringing huge wealth to the country and region , just on russia's border and in direct competition with china , a key russian ally . russia would have been double-insulted by this . one , having a huge prosperous mining town just on their border would surely attract migrants away from russia , and two , russia would almost certainly have to pay ukraine to import its lithium to build evs in the not too distant future . so they just decided they would take both ."

15137,"well i'm russian too and yet i cheer every loss of the russian army . i hope to see ukraine win one day . and in the best case scenario , for russia to be forced to demilitarise and lose all its nuclear weapons and get any military completely banned like in japan after ww2 . unrealistic as hell , i know , but let the man dream .

15140,"of course putin has stated some concerning statements about the threat of nuclear war , and that russia does have the largest amount of nuclear weapons . but before putin even has the chance to even consider that option , either a coup-de'tat will occur or assassination will . so personally it's highly unlikely that he does ."
15141,yeah let them fight and die from bombs instead . if you pick death over giving up donbas good luck . surrender is peace by definition
15142,"how am i supposed to live my life in peace while someone threatens nuclear war every few weeks ? i am extremely scared . it is obvious that we arecloser to nuclear war than the cuban missile crisis . putin has basically made it clear that if he does not claim ukraine and win , he will launch nuclear missiles . i do not want ukraine to surrender and ukrainians to give up their lives . i just believe that nato and ukraine need to start negotiating with russia and de escalating the situation ."
15143,there were massive protests against the iraq and vietnam wars .
15144,"if you consider the first invasion , where crimea and parts of the donbas region proclaimed independence and were backed by russia . it's similar to georgia , where abkhazia and south ossetia have autonomy and are backed by russia ."
15145,"war in donbass , also known as russo-ukrainian war , started 8 years ago after the russian former fsb member and military commander igor girkin(strelkov ) together with his armed group of claimed "" locals "" occupied sloviansk and other cities in the donetsk region , after that ukraine announced anti-terrorist operation in donbass . girkin's decision was later supported by russian official figures , and strelkov's effort in donbass started being supported by the regular russian army , which unofficially remained in the donbass region till 2022 . after that , russian officials tried framing the conflict as a "" civil war "", with no relation to russian armed forces . however , multiple entities of russian-only tech continued appearing in the hands of "" rebels "", and there were multiple proven pieces of evidence of russian military presence in the donbass . the conflict was raging in 2014-2015 , later the ceasefire was agreed upon , but clashes continued well until this year"

15149,thats not why the ruble is growing in value and it does mean something .
15150,he's been permanbanned as a heads-up .
15151,buddy ukraine is not the middle of europe . some people argue over whether slovakia is central or eastern but poland is definitely eastern and ukraine is practically outside of europe . the eastern boundary of europe is between the baltic and the black sea . national borders dont exactly follow a neat line and so bits of russia might be on one side and bits of ukraine on the other but ukraine is definitely not the middle .
15152,the math check out
15153,"i agree , you are objective and i have no answer"
15154,sounds like tbh
15155,"nah , i was being a little facetious with the germany bit . they actually help quite a bit and get an unfair amount of flack . i think thats because theyre considered a kind of leader of europe , so they are expected to meet a higher standard . but its definitely not the only european country that became corrupted by the flow of russian stolen money ."
15156,germany doesn't get the sole blame but it is far wealthier than the eastern european countries and has had decades to improve its energy policies . it is an eu leader and sets an example .
15157,yes putin has made it clear thats the only option . i do not want that to happen but its just the facts . i am sick and tired of people being delusional . once putin is in a corner he will launch nukes . leaders need to start working on de escalation
15158,i was answering to u/decsi93 about their question of what could replace putin did you answer to the right coment ? :)
15159,"direct russian involvement is the only reason the war has been going on since 2014 . ukraine was defending its territory from russian separatists . end of story . i am from a region neighboring donbas . the idea that donbas wanted to merge with russia is absolute nonsense regardless of how many ethnic russians you count . i provided this example in a different thread . tatarstan ( region of russia ) is 53 % tatar and only 40 % russian . if russia is so big on ethnic majority rights , they should start by making tatarstan independent ."
15160,"> east ukraine mainly etnic russians . west ukraine is mainly etnic polish/ukraine . please provide some proof . as it stands , it's either you are incapable of looking up any information before stating bullshit or you are just a russian smoothbrain ."
15161,"oof , sorry to hear that . thankfully both of my parents ( dad in russia and mom here in the usa ) are not buying the z-propaganda . but some of my childhood friends are sadly bought in . i think another clue that points to the narrative being false , is how often they change it , and the stated goals of the operation . i lost count , but so far webe had : demilitarization , denazification , we didnt have a choice because they were planning an attack , bio laboratories , dirty nuclear bombs , preventing nato expansion , reclaiming of historic lands , ukraine is a made up country anyway , and theres probably more that im forgetting . you can examine each one separately and they fall apart easily , but because there are so many , people begin to believe that theres overwhelming evidence to justify the invasion . ive tried talking to propagandized people in russia for the first couple of months , and its really an impossible task . as soon as you state a solid argument against x , they go by what about y!? there are some good russian opposition youtube channels that provide an alternative point of view . these ones i watch fairly regularly : , live - daily live steams about the war , yulia latynina - more in-depth interviews . there are also very good : current time ( good reporting from the ground ), , . to be honest , i think total defeat in this war will be the best outcome for russia in the long run . as much is i love my homeland , its culture , and my memory of the people , its heading in a really bad direction ( to put it mildly ). if russia somehow wins ( or manages to sell it as win to the citizens ), the only way forward is to become north korea 2 , with repressions and total isolation . if it loses , there will be lots of chaos and suffering in the short term , but i think thats the only way to make a significant change , hopefully for the better . i dont want to speak for your country , but it seems that belarus is in a similar situation as russia is with putin ."
15162,"i don't , i pulled the estimate out of my ass . the fact that it is actually 2,500 just goes to illustrate how much more of a propaganda it is , to say azov , of a few thousand is nazi . that still does not justify russia's invasion and harming of millions of people ."
15163,posotive thinking 
15164,"define ' win '. will they take over the entire country ? likely not . will they maintain control over some additional ground , while sustaining continuous massive economic sanctions , and losing troops due to continued fighting on the border ? probably yes . i can't see how that's a ' win ' though . you got more land , but lost most of your economy . as a country , they'd be closer to russia of the early 2000's or even 1990's than to where they were in 2020 . can russia survive this ? maybe , but it's such a huge waste ..."
15165,"posotive thinking , guys ."

15169,"as soon as he realizes his people are against him and he is in a corner , he will launch nukes . he could possibly be assassinated but who will take his place ? how do we know they wont be as lunatic as him ?"
15170,"putin is posturing , he threathened with nukes if sweden and finland join nato . once that happened he switched rethoric that he doesnt mind them joining and actually pulled out troops from border bases . he wouldnt use nukes even if nato interveened directly with troops in ukraine . he knows nato doesnt care of invading russia proper and he wont destroy whole of russia just because he got spanked in ukraine ."
15171,"actually , if russia succeed in their invasion , they'll lose quite a lot of income . for example , countries such as england have stopped paying russia for gass"
15172,you do know about the continent of europe ?
15173,parts of russia are technically europe .
15174,reddit is americans mainly . they support any conflict in europe . just make sure you don't show a nipple on television
15175,do sanctions even work when dealing with a large country that possesses something with intrinsic value ? the rouble just hit a 7 year high in value and is nearing % 40 gains this year . so the average citizen holding roubles gained wealth and must be celebrating without a doubt .
15176,you may think that but i couldn't possibly comment . all i know is the state this country is in right now certainly suits the russian state just fine .
15177,"you are very young aren't you ? the cuban missile crisis had both armies literally stand off front and front thouse were actually high tension keep calm he is not going to launch any nukes this is cold war 2 and he is stalin 2.0 , the threats will always be there it was for 40 years and people still continued to live even under nuclear threats . calm down both sides know nobody wins , and there were even higher tensions heack vietnam had us and russian troops faceing each other afghanistan ( the 1970s war with russia ) had also troops of oposing sides killing each other . turkey shot an airplane of russia in syria and no nukes were launched , a nato country shot a russian airplane and nobody did a thing , not russia or nato . also vice versa this ? this is just the beginning of the cold war 2 , my advice is just go with the flow was back in the day it will be now"
15178,"weird because the russian rouble has risen almost % 40 against the dollar and the euro and is set to one of the highest growing currencies this year . it's almost as if the sanctions did nothing , the rouble momentarily dropped , recovered and climbed steadily ."
15179,"very few definitions of "" central europe "" include parts of ukraine . the habsburgs at one point had part of ukraine so a central argument could be made at that point . ukraine is objectively an eastern european country based on what that term means both geographically and culturally . parts of ukraine are more east than moscow . not even all of russia is considered europe and they are the only ones more east than ukraine . if ukraine isn't eastern europe than who is ?"
15180,eurasia is the continent

15190,there are plenty of russian trolls and bots all over facebook with the one goal - to confuse and weaken public support for the war . i keep seeing the same talking points coming up : * no proof of bucha * nato promised not to to expand east * we are prolonging the war and dragging out * trying to blame us for starting it * ukraine are nazis * trying to make us fight for against the ourselves over who isn't doing enough * claiming half the world support them * our news is biased (!) etc . it's an obvious spoiling tactic . we need a website with links and talking points so we can easily link to videos and images and article etc . any ideas ? or can anyone make that ?
15191,"i'll be honest , when i see some comment on my country ( france ), i don't feel like i'm living in the same country . i'm all in to criticise macron when he say or do dumb stuff , but that doesn't give a pass to hate the country as a whole and the surrender joke are getting tiresome now ."

15199,"tom cooper ( he is reliable ) said that for several days now the russians have been trying to take these villages(vrubivka , komyshuvakha toshivka ) to surround the 20,000 ukrainians in severodonetsk and lysychanks . how has it been so far ? very badly : in fact , the arrival of nato weapons ( especially usa , estonian and italian ) has allowed not only ukraine to tear apart the russian forces but also to push them away from the strata that connect lysychanks to bakhmut . however he also said that putin has ordered all possible reinforcements to be sent from russia so these new attacks may indicate that reinforcements have arrived . the ukrainians have done a great job avoiding the encirclement and repelling the russians so far but the battle is far from the end , you must not claim victory too soon : the russians will try again and are already trying again"

15336,"someone posed a question about how some patrol boats that us pledged would be delivered to ukraine . and that got me thinking about how large of a warship could make the transit along the rhine-main-danube route to the black sea , and what the practical limitations to such a delivery method would be . u/chaos0xomega is one smart cookie and they brought up possible height limitations . the whole ( albeit short ) thread is here [ well , i was doing some checking and the smallest frigates , corvettes , or destroyer escorts have a draft of a little over 4 meters ; with some being even shallower than that into the 3 meter range . lifted directly from wikipedia , > the channel is a waterway class vb ; the largest authorised vessel is 190 metres ( 620 ft ) long and 11.45 metres ( 37.6 ft ) wide . the channel in the kelheim-bound bamberg lock has a depth of 2.70 metres ( 8.9 ft ). i'm not sure if that's the shallowest one along the route , but i'm going on the assumption that that's a good starting figure . like the brandenburg class listed below , i expect some of the stated drafts could be due to sonar apertures and/or screws and not the actual hull's depth . you could lighten the load on these vessels by removing stores , ammunition , and some easily dismountable equipment like guns , radar , etc . the sonar gear and screws are also removable if you need to make the vessel shallower . it might even make getting permission to transit from the countries en route much more palatable if the warship(s ) in question were under tow and disarmed . if there's a friendly drydock or floating drydock in the black sea , you simply reinstall everything when it arrives . if it's a previously retired or older ship , this could simply be part of its modernization . strip out whatever was going to be replaced , tow it through , and then start the work of installing the new stuff . the height issue is one i hadn't been aware of though . it's possible to remove the masts and such ; possibly raze some of the superstructure as well . this would also serve to lower the draft even further . what are the height limitations along the route ? i saw some images of river cruise vessels and freighters that were fairly tall , but i have no idea if they travelled the entire route . here are some of the active and/or reserve ships that could be considered . anzac class : draught 4.35 m ( 14.3 ft ) at full load ) la fayette-class frigate : draught 4.1 m ( 13 ft 5 in ). floral-class frigate : draught 4.3 m ( 14 ft 1 in ) brandenburg-class frigate : draught 4.35 metres ( 14.3 ft ) ( 6.3 metres ( 21 ft ) over sonar ) elli-class frigate : draft 4.4 m ( 14 ft 5 in ) alpino-class frigate : draught 3.8 m ( 12 ft 6 in ) lupo-class frigate : draft 3.7 m ( 12 ft ) maestrale-class frigate : draught 4.2 m ( 14 ft ) ybari-class destroyer escort : draft 3.6 m ( 11 ft 10 in ) abukuma-class destroyer escort : draft 12 ft ( 3.7 m ) jacob van heemskerck-class frigate : draught 4.4 m ( 14 ft 5 in ) some of these are older or already retired and it could suit the nation in question to hand them over to ukraine . especially if they were planning or already in the process of replacing them . and this list doesn't include larger vessels , like america's mothballed oliver hazard perry class , that could possibly transit with the removal of sonar/screws and the removal of topweight . it could be an expensive process depending on the work involved in making the warship(s ) shallower and shorter . but it seems like it might be viable , at least in principle . does anyone know what the height restrictions from bridges are ? could they be partially dealt with by lower the water level via dams/locks ? are there any treaties that make this an exercise in futility ? it seems like the iron gates are no longer the shipping obstacle they once posed , is this correct ? any professionals or knowledge sponges out there , how much shallower could you realistically make a vessel by losing weight , screws , and sonar gear ? i know they'll get shallower , but how much are we talking about ?"
15337,"is the sten design philosophy an example of how the world can address the armament supply issues ? *"" .. design philosophy of the sten , namely their low cost and ease of manufacture . though the mp40 was also built largely for this purpose , otto skorzeny went on record saying that he preferred the sten because it required less raw material to produce , and performed better under adverse combat conditions .""* generally , sten guns and the numerous variants focused on simply being able to do the job , often due to desperate times , being produced cheaply and in large numbers without all the bells and whistles . i've read articles on reddit about how ukraine is not getting enough artillery to be able to sufficiently concentrate it , so as to prevent russians from grouping for attacks . it went on to suggest that this also prevented ukraine from being able to disrupt enemy actions that prevent it grouping for attacks of it's own . i've also read about how the diverse range of equipment and systems being supplied to ukraine could become a problem in the future , as they begin to suffer ware issues and require parts to fix and maintain . as they use different parts , part factories in different countries , have different manuals etc it makes supply of parts difficult , or the repair times lengthy . the more advanced nature of the weapons being supplied i guess compound this . looking at the sten design philosophy , and being pretty ignorant of weapon production , i was wondering if it could be applied to artillery ? a simpler , less advanced artillery weapon that can be more cheaply and quickly produced , that is easier to maintain and also hopefully quicker and easier to produce . ( it might also cut down training times , but if it's less advanced then crews might need to learn how to manually carry out tasks that modern equipment effectively automates .) the design could be shared between supporting nations , with each nation building what they can from the same blueprints , with no advanced technology at risk of russia or third party interrogation . it would not be designed to replace the more advanced systems , but to bridge the gap between now and when a sufficient number of more advanced systems have been delivered , and then to supplement them . an artillery piece is however not a submachine gun , and if the weapons produced are ww2ish level of sophistication it could be that they are , despite russia's equivalent equipment issues , too basic to effectively do anything more than waste resources in production and transportation , use of valuable ammo etc . i was hoping to get more informed opinions on this and how it could be achieved , if there was any value in trying to do so . please be gentle :)"

15345,"this is by far the best source for understanding and disassociating nazism from pro-ukrainian perspectives . along with investigating ukraine's history , while blaming the us and nato for russia's invasion of ukraine , this book distinguishes the controversial azov batallion's nazi origins from the overarching framework of ukrainian culture , by way of acknowledging the fact that much of the azov batallion's original neo-nazi membership is comprised of native russian-speakers from eastern ukraine . they are not products of ukrainian culture in the western parts of ukraine , where the majority of native ukrainian speakers reside . the book also explains how in ukraine , the propagation of both soviet-era nostalgia and leaders like joseph stalin , who was the main perpetrator of the holodomor(murder and starvation of millions of ukrainians ), can give rise to counter-extremism such as nazism . because azov was part and parcel of a largely de-centralized ukrainian resistence to the pro-russian seperatists in eastern ukraine during the 8 year civil war ( there were many private militias fighting the seperatists ), the ukrainian government basically annexed the paramilitary group , as well as other private militias , into the ukrainian army...all for the sake of a more organized resistance to seperatist and russian forces in the donbas region . at the same time , the ukrainian army did not assume their ideology . it was the other way around . the private militas were indoctrinated and consigned into true ukrainian nationalism . now , it is true that the azov were instrumental in helping ukraine , and are at the same time , highly skilled , tactical and pose a real danger if they continue to uphold their nazi ideology and resist full integration into the ukrainian army . but i highly doubt zelensky , nor much of the native ukrainian-speaking populations of ukraine would tolerate it . besides , the azov has already begun to disavow nazi perspectives ."
15346,"it is a crucial phase of the war because what ukraine is doing is really risky . ukraine wants to force russia to destroy itself in order to take lysychanks : if this strategy succeeds then russia is screwed because to obtain a propaganda victory it has concentrated almost all its forces in this area and if it loses them it has lost . however russia knows this and in fact is desperately trying to cut the two roads connecting lysychanks to backmut ( t1302 and t1303 ). if russia can do it then ukraine would lose nearly 20,000 troops ... just ... poof and lysychanks would be totally surrounded and russia can really succeed it , it is sending every man it can to get it done it is true , russia is gaining territories but it is not yet clear who will win the war . however it can be said with certainty that depending on whether the encirclement occurs or not , it will be understood who is destined to win"
15347,"i'm talking to some russian friends who have a very different view of the conflict . i'm wondering if anyone has any responses to these ideas -- preferably with sources ? so ** their ** idea of the conflict seems to be : - after the 2014 maidan uprising , the legitimately-elected president was illegally deposed and replaced . in response , parts of the donbas decided they were not on board with the replacement -- and seceded . those parts of the donbas have never been allowed to vote in any election since . - the illegitimate ukrainian gov't then sent in the army , and russia decided to defend the russians living there . this has what has led to the conflict -- and to the ukrainians killing many ethnic russians as a result . - also , the ukrainian gov't was persecuting ethnic russians in the donbas , making it illegal to speak russian or to learn it , destroying russian culture , etc . - russia tried to make peace with minsk agreements , but zelensky wouldn't honor it , even after he said he would while campaigning . - so finally , russia was forced to defend the russian-speaking peoples of eastern ukraine with force . any sourced articles that would dispute these ?"

15383,"a huge amount , don't forget nato/eu/ukraine is also waging information war . also just basic common sense not to print in the press exactly what you will be sending and when you will be sending it . it will be fascinating to read the history books after all this and see what was really going on behind the scenes ."
15384,germany has send quite a few things they have not said publicly . that won't win any pr war but hopefully it helps ukraine win their war . if that means germany stays the bad guy for europe so be it
15385,it won t be under the radar if i told you ?
15386,alot of equipment for sure
15387,"just a lot of ill-informed speculation and wishful thinking . first off , the plant was by no accounts destroyed . a warehouse of finished chemicals burned down . second , even if it had , simply saying "" everything is needed in war "" doesn't magically mean everything will grind to a halt in weeks . > "" afaik , they are the only maker of a huge range of solvents and reactives of this kind "" first off "" a reactive "" isn't a chemical term . maybe he means "" reagent "" but they don't make reagents , they make base solvents , mainly paint thinners and common bulk chemicals like butyl acetate , used in varnishes ( and according to the company 90 % of that is for exports ) not rocket fuel . imagining that they won't be able to produce printed circuit boards because they won't have solvents to wash the pcbs with because of this one fire is just wishful speculation . it's pretty ridiculous . the claim that this is a ' critical ' supplier to hundreds of defense industries is completely unsubstantiated here . saying in effect "" everything was centralized in the ussr so this must be their only factory "" is not an excuse to actually try to find out . there are other plants that produce stuff like tolulene and butyl alcohol . gazprom and lukoil petrochemical plants . i look that up instead of just saying "" afaik "" as if not knowing about something means it doesn't exist . there's no fact-based argument made here saying russia's domestic capacity can't replace the loss in production ( if there is one , which again , there is no account of ), nor an actual argument that imports can't make up the loss if it doesn't . just saying trade with china "" is going to be complicated on a numerous levels "" doesn't prove the case , it's hand-waving . china's far from the only country that's trading with russia anyway . another really ignorant factual error is the completely baseless claim about vocs . a voc is an organic compound with a boiling point between 50 och 260c . it has nothing to do with ' shelf life '. nothing . a compound's volatility has nothing to do with chemical stability . that's just completely wrong , more wishful speculation . the products the dimitrevsky factory produces such as butyl acetate , isobutyl alcohol , tolulene , acetone , metyl acetate have essentially indefinite shelf life if stored correctly . but let's all pretend the russian war machine is going to come to a screeching halt in a month because of a warehouse fire , because it's more fun to live in a fantasy than to think critically . sigh ."
15388,good job 
15389,"yep , i had noted a post that said it would be over in a week , 23 days ago . just stumbled on it again . and other prominent people at the other extreme are saying it'll go for years or be a frozen conflict . i hope the poor russians (/ s ) don't have to fight through ukrainian winter . hopefully they are ruined , routed , and removed long before that . but there is no certainty . :("
15390,"jominiw is my go to for quality maps , but they don't seem to update them that often . the youtuber "" speak the truth "" does a new video every day with his own map that's quite good and he talks the viewer through it as he goes along , although i think he takes a few liberties with his own assessments of the action going on ."
15391,"i think it's neutral . i saw on liveuamap that all of luhansk is without power , and that's where most of the fighting is right now . so there's no cell towers to post updates or footage . we don't know how the front's looking , or anything like that . on the other side of it , it means that the russians have , at the very least , failed to make a significant enough breakthrough to push into a place with power . so for all we know , the ukrainians are holding fine and barely budging an inch ; or they're slowly giving ground and being pushed out of luhansk . either way it's not decided yet and we'll know more once they get power back in the area , or if the line gets broken completely ."
15392,"expected . uaf only releases information when it's not of significance anymore . when it's just daily skirmishes that happens at the end of the day , but now that there are larger battles going on it will be much longer . russia propaganda services releases information whenever they want people to believe it , but it rarely has connection to reality ."
15393,between the fog of war and being further away from the capital news is just gonna travel slower . first couple of days of the kyiv offensive were a blur and it took about a week for the scale of the russian stall to be realized .
15394,"even in the first few weeks we had much less information from the donbas than from the area around kyiv . the ukrainian forces at the line of control were always much more restrained in taking videos and publishing reports than their territorial defense brethren elsewhere . there were no civilians mixed into the defense there , and it showed ( or rather it didn't , media silence / opsec )"
15395,the way they think is really messed up .
15396,can we take a moment to remember that it took actual nazis years to condition the german people to view their enemies the way it took russians to view fake-nazis in a couple months ?
15397,> and if a nation is stronger they deserve to take whatever they want . that doesn't sound very centrist to me .
15398,"> and if a nation is stronger they deserve to take whatever they want . they should support ukraine for exposing russia as not as strong as they thought , and further support us sending all arms to ukraine to make them stronger . if russia has a problem with this , they should've been strong enough to stop all of nato . in truth , these "" there is no morality , i am centrist "" are either completely disaffected or radicals lying about their beliefs . both are the most susceptible to propaganda"

15405,"russians and pro-russian trolls generally seem to be stupid enough that they don't realize that properly functioning militaries wouldn't send high-ranking officers to front line units . they just see russia doing it and assume everybody does it , because if russia's doing it it must be a good thing ( instead of a sign of a totally failed military )"
15406,western shipments/agreements too slow . sounds like ukrainians don't really expect to have enough stuff and get trained on it - to counter attack until late july/august .
15407,being so overmatched it is ukraines best interests to hang back and make russia expend forces making small advances . so far it is working . small advances by russia . small advances by ukraine . as more and more munitions make it to ukraine russia is going to loose more and more . as more and more mothers find they can no longer contact their sons things might start to change .

15410,"you might ask him to define winning . russia now occupies more territory due to invasion but it has paid for this with lives and global isolation . e.g ., nato is growing . virtually no one believes that russia could take all of ukraine , let alone hold it ."
15411,"if russia was winning they would have won 130 days ago . why the delay ? the delay is because russian lost , and is still losing . putin needs to stay in power for russia to keep losing , but he will be dead before too long , my guess is october 27th for the death of putin . with russia finally realizing they lost sometime in 2023 . there should be some place we can bet on the timing of that outcome . any other outcome , like russia winning , is not going to happen ."
15412,"well they are still taking territory , even if it's at a heavy cost . we don't know if ukraine can pull off large scale counter offenses yet . we'll see how kherson plays out . but your brother is right . russia lost the first campaign , but the jury is still out on the second ."
15413,ask yourself if russia gained some benefits from this war . i mean russia is in a better position now instead the pre war situation ? a war is a trade off between costs and benefits . you win when benefits are higher than costs .
15414,"some people are just defeatist . ask him what he wouldve thought in 1940 , 1941 , 1942 , and 1943 . some people will always say the past was obvious while thinking all is lost in the present until its obvious . like walter conkrite who thought himself smarter and more honest than the american military after the tet offensive ( a massive strategic defeat of vc units that destroyed the viet cong that delivered communist north vietnam a strategic propaganda victory thanks to the media that clinched the decision to begin pulling out ) and unintentionally lied to middle america about it . russia is running out of equipment and skilled manpower , while ukraine is getting stronger . the russians are still crawling forward , but the long term trends favor ukraine ."
15415,"it depends entirely on what somebody means by "" winning "". russia now occupies a lot more of ukraine than they did before the invasion , so that could be considered winning . but they have gotten themselves into a really bad position and when the ukranians start really pushing back the russians very well may look like they are losing ."
15416,where is live map ?
15417,"until ukraine has sufficient 155 arty they will be pushed back here and there . hopefully they deploy some of the new guns soon , theyre really short of 152mm ammo"
15418,it was reported that russia took control of kurulka . it looks like russia is trying to cut off or disrupt railway and supply lines that go to ukraine's frontline troops .
15419,twitter post deleted
15420,"i think hes exactly right about summer being campaign season . and if we are wanting ukraine to get through that season then , we as americans & european allies , need to act now and ramp hard in may . clark knows what hes talking about . no doubt about that ."
15421,"it's a supply line or land bridge for logistics to flow into ukraine . that is what they want it for and will still be functional as that , even as rubble ."
15422,"absolutely not . russia is still collecting troops and probing while bombarding ukrainian positions in anticipation of a large attack . the pace of troop death and equipment destruction is rising , not dropping ."
15423,"lol 12 hours of no fighting dude . both armies need to resupply and evaluate tactics before moving forward , along with weather conditions changing . armies just dont charge into death every single day"
15424,"kyiv wasn't a large scale counter offensive though . the ukrainians were able to inflict so much damage on the russians , cut them off from their supplies completely , that the russians had no choice but to retreat and give up on taking kyiv completely . the whole thing was achieved by ukraine utilising a defense in depth doctrine and didn't even require them to actively start pushing russia back . they defeated the russians on the russian offensive ."
15425,"this is an awesome idea ! apart from the fact that its currently offline due to technical issues , it represents a new level of civil ingenuity , for concerned global citizens to send a little bit of fuck you to those who would seek to prosper from positions in an oppressive regime . i doubt it will bring about a material change in the ukrainian conflict , but its cathartic to think that putins acolytes are being whacked on the side of their heads with a phone book . slava ukraine !"
15426,prisoner swaps or make it a condition of any peace deal./lifting sanctions . they likely aren't coming back soon .
15427,"kh-22 has cep of 500m so they are wildly inaccurate . they probably think if they'll fire enough missiles they'll eventually destroy what they are trying to destroy . so basically it's attacking legit targets and the same time it's inaccurate enough that it could count as indiscriminate attack on civilian area . i wonder if it's why they were lying about the mall in kremenchuk being closed and a military supply depot . like it probably sounds better to their public opinion than "" we're firing huge missiles half of which land more than 500m from their target and we accidentally have hit a mall next to the target . it's just colatteral damage ! sorry !"""
15428,"one argument i keep seeing the appeaseniks use is that this is happening because of nato expansionism - which ignores a couple crucial facts : 1 . nato refused to let ukraine join ; if they really wanted to expand they would have done so in 2008 . 2 . sweden and finland are now likely to join nato , not because nato has coerced them into doing so but out of self-preservation in the face of a clearly belligerent , untrustworthy russia . 3 . ukraine has every right to join whatever mutual-defense treaty they choose , they have no obligation to subject themselves to rape and murder in order to pacify some cowardly defeatists . 4 . allowing russia to annex part of ukraine isn't a solution , it's just amplifying the problem , because anyone who is actually paying attention and intellectually honest realizes that putin has been very clear about his intentions of expanding the russian sphere of influence . if he gets part of ukraine he will be back for the rest of it , and then he will keep going . the appeasenik position is this : ukraine should just let the russians rape and murder them , because otherwise they're just prolonging the war ."
15429,ummmm . can i get this for china too
15430,[ this infographic ]( of the underground shelters at azovstal suggests that the bunkers may have access via tunnels to others areas of mariupol . no idea of the credibility though ...
15431,"ukraine flew in some supplies by helicopter until late march , but unlikely to be realistic anymore . they are most likely having to survive on whatever they have managed to store up underneath the plant ."
15432,kadirov took most of his forces back to chechnya to protect himself . actually most of the putin's friends and high level supporters are trying to keep their personal special forces ( basically personal armies ) alive and well and avoid using them in ukraine right now at all cost . putin is loosing the war and they expect some internal fighting in the future and need these soldiers for that .
15433,one of their hqs was detonated lately . lots of casualties in the video . i think many of them have tikd their last tok .
15434,not sure . i did read that the combines the kadyrovs sent back to kadyrov's farm in chechnya were the very modern type . so the producers connected to them and disabled them once they were started there . turns out that there * is * no right to repair stolen tractors in checnya . maybe they got recalled to manually till the fields ...
15435,once ukraine has more artillery and ammo it will be even harder for them to push.theyre short on 152 . hopefully within a month/few weeks or so they can deploy some of the 155 crews we trained here in the us . i know we sent them over 40k 155 rounds but im sure they will need even more
15436,"only from the point of view that putin seems to have genuinely believed that his forces would be welcomed with open arms . what basis he had for apparently believing this is anyone's guess . have his advisors been telling him only what he wants to hear ? is he merely ignoring information he does not like ? i also read that while putin has massively increased arms spending , most of that money has gone into the pockets of corrupt generals etc , which is hardly surprising as they take their lead from the the top ! but once again , putin seems to have believed that his forces were superbly well equipped and trained . finally we call people like putin and xi "" strong men "", personally i find this label ridiculous , the one thing dictators are not is strong , strength is to trust the people , to abide by free and fair elections , to abide by the law . dictators are cowards who live in fear because they would rather persecute and bully their own people than risk leaving power and facing their crimes and corruption . but i digress , putin and his ilk seem to believe that because democracies usually prefer diplomacy over conflict , prefer dialogue over war , this makes them weak . nothing could be further from the truth , the usa and other nato countries can rely on soft power because their hard power is truly awesome . putin , like ( hitler before him did about the uk and france ), seems to have genuinely believed that nato and especially the usa and eu would not have the stomach for this war , that they are effete and soft . so i guess what i'm saying is that from the deluded , possibly psychotic , bubble in which putin was living , this invasion might have made sense . but in the real world it was always utterly brainless ."
15437,"my view is somewhere down the road russia will give it all back especially when they completely lose there energy revenue from the west , all the grain in the world will not match a billion a day for energy . also , ukrainian factories that make stuff for the west will not be trading with the west under russian control . putin has created a toxic bubble around him self and all of this is a delusional dream around bringing back the ussr . he is a reincarnation !"
15438,"if they had indeed the most powerful military yes . natural ressources , agricultural land , acces to the black sea , buffer zone between mainland and nato . easier acces to disrupt neighboring countries . from an imperialist perspective it made sense . but it's a failed state , not an empire . so no , it doesn't make sense ."
15439,"no , it is dictated by ideological possession and chauvinism . some people are trying to portray putin as some sort of 4d chess player when in realty he is a mediocre kgb bureaucrat who is nostalgic over soviet union , which was highly impressed by writings of ivan ilyin and dugin and really took this shit to heart . he is a poker player , which loves to bluff . he also really believes forged shitty history books written in moscow on how everything in the world is really russian in origin and how russians are the most ancient people . poor grandpa doesn't understands that and are different words . he really believes ukrainians do not exist . he was repeating that line "" we are one people "" for last decades . ukrainians that keep speaking ukrainian and do not want to become "" reeducated "" must be eliminated and replaced with populations from regions of russia , just as it was done before in holodomors . existence of a post ussr prospering country on it's border who managed to crawl up from soviet shithole is a bad example for russian population and an existential threat to putin . he is very salty about people of ukraine civilizational choice to be with europe and very salty about "" decommunization "". tape of gadaffi's murder also highly impressed putin . as long as he is alive he is probably not gonna give up his crazy 17th sentry type plans on ukraine ."
15440,"artillery is generally considered a "" soft "" target as it is usually unarmored or not very heavily armored . pretty much any weapon system larger than a rifle should be capable of damaging or destroying them ."
15441,the gun crews certainly would be a target .
15442,"even the smaller switchblade 300 has a 40mm grenade warhead , which would take out the crew and possibly render the artillery piece combat ineffective . us troops used a lot of the 300s in afghanistan to good effect ."
15443,there's been no confimation of it whatsoever from _any_ side but so many newspapers etc just ran with the story anyhow . all of them just use the few same tweets as source .
15444,"i heard estimates half of their usable tanks are destroyed . and they used 3/4 of their guided missiles . probably not much better for other equipments . if russia fully mobilize , their troops will run in with ak-47 and soviet uniform . their equipment is getting worse as best western weapons are flooding ukraine . i discounted as propaganda for a long time , but i'm starting to think ukraine victory is inevitable . it doesn't matter how many troops russia has if they run out of modern weapons"
15445,"the fact is that the only people who truly know these answers would never share them . ukrainian leadership has felt that it is in the place to make demands , such as the return of crimea , which i think is a positive sign . defense is always easier than offense . russia's inability to advance doesn't necessarily mean russia couldn't blow the hell out of anything that approaches their entrenched positions . but ukraine also appears to be operating with very high level international intel , which has a big balancing effect . the truth is we will not know until the day comes or new evidence is discovered ."
15446,"russia is having problems along some of its fronts even without a ukrainian counter-offensive , so i think things should be pretty good by june . sure , troops can dig in , but that doesn't help much if all the fuck they want to do is get the hell out of dodge :)"
15447,"alongside the other points made here , the weather is another relevant concern . by june , the mud should have begun to dry , and mobile armour move more freely off road and removes a defensive advantage - if you are going to counterattack , the summer is a good time to do it , though of course , russian tanks can leave the roads too . see why putin launched the invasion at the end of the winter , just as the ground was thawing out , is a mystery to me , but presumably was about political rather than military goals ."
15448,the return of the privateer perhaps ?

15457,i think it's likely that the point is to a ) secure kharkiv so that forces currently occupied with protecting kharkiv can be freed up to be deployed elsewhere b ) stop the attacks on kharkiv that are damaging the city and killing civilians c ) threaten russian supply lines running through belgorod
15458,"heavier and more difficult to use/train than javelins . if the us really is unwilling to give any more javelins , we might start to see tows making an appearance soon . also , ukraine's own equivalent , the stugna-p , is arguably better than tow so it'd probably feel like a bit of a kick in the teeth . not to mention that in ukraine's largely flat terrain isn't ideal for using tows since they'll be spotted a mile away , unlike syria which had much better options for setting up outside of line of sight . i think ukraine has so many portable at missiles at this point ( remember the uk and many other countries are sending their own at missiles too ), that the priority now is artillery , loitering ammunition and fighting vehicles . switchblade drones in particular are tactically a considerable upgrade over tow ."
15459,i suspect that the significant number of launchers and missiles provided to various anti assad forces in syria might have depleted available stocks of both . the other answer has touched on a number of good points as well .

15467,"mariupol is slightly different in that it was deep , deep inside enemy territory . even if ukrainian troops are cut off in some parts of donbass , it will take several months to force them to surrender and russia will need an airtight perimeter the entire time . i just don't see it . if russia encircles ukrainian forces they still have all the work ahead of them , those forces won't just lay down their arms and surrender because of some lines on a map . imo the days of great encirclements is over . it's a relic of ww2 that doesn't really fit very well with modern warfare . lifting supplies is much easier nowadays and most forces have a much lighter supply footprint already . i agree the situation in popasna looks bad . i'm just not convinced it'll give russia the win you're expecting . ukraine has enormous uncommitted forces it can throw at a relief effort if russian forces achieve what is still quite an improbable encirclement . russia will need to hold a precarious perimeter until at least august to affect a victory here , with a very real risk of being cut off themselves ."

15474,i did just that . after leaving a comment that proves i heard everything he had to say ! ;)
15475,"well , it is not about the cost of tanks . putin can't produce new tanks anyway , since the only tank factory in russia is not producing anything for the moment due to the lack of parts ( officially speaking ) and due to corruption of putin's regime ( realistically speaking ). also the factory has not been working properly for a long time . stopping the production on a regular basis . and even when it was working it still produced very few modern tanks . as far as i remember it was something like 14 tanks armata . none of those are in ukraine . i don't no why putin's generals don't use them , but if i had to guess , my bet is that these tanks are not battle ready and probably made for show to excuse the stolen money that were given to their development and production . so , what putin really spends most of his money for ? well , there are no real analysis to speak about , since criminals don't share such information . however , it is basically a common knowledge that putin's has to pay a lot to his - soldiers , special forces , national guards , kgb agents , government clerks , government owned corporations and their employees ( most of the corporations are unprofitable and have been for a long time due to corruption ), tv talking heads who spreads his propaganda and so on . this is a huge amount of money he has to pay . and he stays in power as long as he has the money to pay . all these people he pays to are protecting his regime from russians . it is literally what made him president in russia and did not let russians to kick him out . which is why everybody talks about money putin gets for selling oil and gas . when these sells stops and nobody buys oil and gas - the war stops , since it is pretty much the only major source of his income ."
15476,"all those losses in cold war era tanks and flagship cruisers are "" sunk costs ."" replacement costs for that equipment will actually be more . the manpower losses will cost russia just as much , if not more , in the future ( lost gdp from labor/earnings )."

15488,"> why has russia said that inviting ukraine to nato would be illegal ? almost nothing russia says has any basis in reality and they are almost physically incapable of telling the truth . don't pay them any mind . > what other reasons would russia have for not wanting ukraine to join nato ? because they want to invade , occupy , and annex ukraine which nato makes more difficult for them . > if the nato thing isn't true , what is the reason for the invasion ? see above . they see themselves as having a colonial/imperial right to dominate ukraine . > what's to stop the uk and the rest of europe simply sweeping through ukraine , driving russia back to the borders and holding them ? fears of nuclear war ; although i really don't care anymore . i don't think russia can convince itself to start a nuclear war just because they aren't allowed to invade other countries like nazis . > why have so many other countries offered support but not military support ? they have sent massive amount of weapons which is military support ."
15489,"i believe ukraine was strictly forbidden from filming or discussing their use as a condition of them being sent . i suspect they have been underwhelming . when the operator pilots the switchblade to its target area and finds a bunch of enemy forces , they're going to rue having to pilot it into a kamikaze attack when they'd long to be able to loiter and guide artillery fire onto their quarry instead . even if there's no artillery available , they'd rather be able to observe as long as possible rather than blind themselves with a kamikaze strike . but alas the switchblade is quickly out of fuel so nothing else to do but attack . even to find a target for the switchblade , it'd be using a reconnaissance drone to find enemy forces then send out the switchblade to attack it . but if you have the reconnaissance drone watching already why not just artillery strike it ? much quicker and more effective ."
15490,"conservatively 25 %, optimistically 50 %. depends on whose casualty figures you trust and what assumptions you make about the quality of russian tanks in "" storage "". ukraine claims 1,500 tanks destroyed , the us claims 1,000 destroyed . oryx has verified over 850 destroyed , though it is likely a considerable undercount since this turned into an artillery war and we just don't have the pictures of tanks destroyed behind russia's own lines . i personally subscribe to the view that ukrainian governments's figures are probably closer to the truth . russia had something like 3,000 battle ready tanks at start , and another 6,000 + rusting hulks of t-62s parked in "" storage "" in siberia for decades . the pictures of the latter look absolutely dreadful , and it's estimated less than 10 % are fit to drive , due to severe corrosion and the looting of valuable parts . plus a t-62 can barely be called a tank in the modern sense anyway , their armour is only 100mm thick equivalent at it's thickest compared to t-72's 1,000mm thick equivalent armour . they're relics , better suited to ww2 battlefields than modern ones ."
15491,"as creepy as it sounds , i actually find it easier to grasp brutal totalitarian logic than this kind of mystical mythical mumbo jumbo ."

15493,it always seems to be the rich that complain
15494,"today i have heard about a shortage of 152 mm artillery shells . there is not much in the way of munitions that is easier than making dumb he artillery shells . people have been making , and improving them for 150 years . what is involved ? - make a mold . - cast the body . - machine the nose and back end . - fill with explosive - screw on the back cap - provide fuses to be installed at the last minute . - propellant charges are in a separate can , and is just a can with primer and propellant charge . there are a few other details , like the rifling bands , but the main thing is to make the shells the same weight and the same outer shape , so the same artillery aiming tables can be used . one smart artillery shell probably does the job of 50 or 100 dumb artillery shells , when attacking a single object , like an armored car . but there are times when firing 100 or 1000 shells are what you want to do . i think , in the usa there are about 3 factories making ak rifle ammunition . you need a larger factory to make artillery shells , but it should be possible to adapt an existing factory to make 152mm artillery shells in a couple of weeks , tops . maybe less than a week ."
15495,at least igor over there is a realist . much more then can be said of russias population .
15496,"your blog is a very interesting read . i would remark only two things . one is purely a typo : "" the shooter "" and not "" shoter "" as a translation for strelkov . the other thing is slightly more controversial but needs to be said . we constantly show the numbers from levada to say that russians are in support of the war . but polling numbers from dictatorial countries are notoriously unreliable and sharing them without an asterisk actually plays into putins propaganda . it is of course possible that indeed 80 % of russians support the invasion , but it's also very likely that quite a large part of those 80 % didn't give their actual opinion for fear of prosecution . one also needs to point to the existence of the freedom for russia legion to see that it's not that one sided . all that being said , maybe add a disclaimer or something to say that "" well , these are the numbers , but they're very likely to be false up to some point "". otherwise good job and an insight i hadn't seen yet !"
15497,"im not on russians side but from what i gather from people with knowledge on the subject , they pretend to pay us so we pretend to work . they know we know but they dont care . its why that airport has gotten bombed 20 times . they simply do not care because theres no incentive to improve ."
15498,"the "" russian side "" are russian people who sit in jails in russia , killed by putin , forced to emigration or keep silence under threats . these russian people are the russian side , not putin and his criminals . so the answer is - the criminals can't win . it because after 20 + years of dealing with the known criminal regime the leaders of the europe and usa finally decided to stop supporting putin's regime and start supporting people who fight against putin . the problem is that putin can't stop and give up . if he does he will likely not survive even 5 minutes after that . his own friends and supporters will kill him , because the criminal boss who failed can't be the boss anymore ."
15499,this sub is the most bias one out of them all
15500,"+ a shame this sub only shares the "" good "" news and not anything negative . the war isn't going as well as people think"
15501,"if you only use this subreddit for information on the war , i can understand why you say this . there is plenty of good information on this subreddit , but most people have no idea what they are talking about and that's where the false expectations come from . ukraine has had huge successes that deserve our highest praise , and i am also convinced time is on ukraine's side and they are going to win . but the fight is far from over and it's definitely not decided yet . but if you read this subreddit you would get the idea that russia is on the verge of defeat and that russia is going to be partioned between several nations . the fact is that russia has superior firepower , airpower and manpower in the donbas at the moment . but to be honest , the situation isn't that grim . the only highway to sieverodonetsk is under threat of being cut off by the russians , that's the most important part . the russians have focused their strength here and it appears it came as a surprise as ukrainian strength is elsewhere . if the road is cut off , of course it's bad news , but sieverodonetsk can hold out just fine for several months at least . the russians have to hold this strenuous line for several months in indefensible terrain . unless the russians also manage to further isolate this hypothetical pocket by pushing down south and dig in . if they achieve that , then it would be a very costly loss for ukraine ."
15502,"the us killing 100,000s of civilians in iraq is also a classic twist . the best estimates are that around 15,000 iraqi civilians were killed by coalition forces in total over more than a decade of war . number 1 cause of death of civilians in the iraq war : beheading . not by us soldiers , but by insurgents in sectarian violence . now there's a great case that the mass killing of civilians by militias and terrorists would never have happened had the coalition not invaded , and that therefore the countries that took part in the invasion are responsible for all those deaths , but to suggest that makes the behaviour of coalition forces the same as russia's is outrageous . coalition forces didn't shoot , bomb or execute those people themselves , such numbers are absurd ."
15503,"cruise missiles , usually"
15504,"missiles are launched from launchers in belarus and russia , or from naval assets in the black sea"
15505,"well i live in ukraine and i don't see it ending soon . if it will end at all . too much hate between nations ( in russia mostly because of propaganda , taking in account their easily-manipulative mentality/quality of life ). there's simply no peaceful solution to end this . putin dont have way out from the war without losing his face and ukraine cant accept leaving occupied territories to russia . also hard to say where its leaning . definitely russia have much more resources and income . but if ukraine lose this war ... well eu will have a new cool neighbour with 3rd worldwide amount of nuclear silos available and with huge amount of nuclear power plants to supply russia's war machine ."
15506,"russia is burning through its soviet surplus military equipment at an unsustainable rate , but they won't change tactics . soldiers in the field mostly won't retreat without orders , commanders further back won't order a retreat because then they get a firing squad , so they just send tanks and trucks forward at the same pace . i think they're going to keep up their pace another few weeks and then just won't have the next batch to send , and the russian front will just collapse suddenly ."
15507,"ukraine is getting almost unlimited weapons from the west . but i see them as having limited manpower . russia has a large population to conscript from . however ; while russia does have a large weapons cache , this burn rate is unsustainable and their supply lines are sanctioned and constrained . so its a question of what happens first , 1 . does ukraine run low on manpower , 2 . does russian supplies run too low that they stall out , or 3 . putin removed by some peers or his people . the later would be the quickest and smoothest ."
15508,"that's a big part of it--if our lads hadn't managed to fend off the first assaults on hostomel with that kind of weaponry , the russians might have been in position for a decapitation strike and things could have gone much worse . but i also think a variety of other factors--flooding the area around kyiv ( spell it like that ) made it even harder for russian forces to advance , russian logistics were just god-awful and unorganized , and russian assessment of what they were going to face just completely wrong--were more important ."
15509,its almost impossible take kiev from east . stupid attempt .

15513,"kalibr and iskandr are low altitude cruise missiles . high altitude cruise missiles are easier to intercept unless they go into space , which would be icbms and those are generally reserved for nukes . low flying makes them very hard to detect with radar and hard to hit with air defence . think of how long you can watch a play fly overhead when its at cruising altitude , now imagine if it flew 50m off the ground at the same speed , it'd zoom over in a couple of seconds ."

15519,"if you go on yt and look at volodymyr zolkin's videos , he's a journalist who interviews russian pows , and does a smashing job , including time stamps . if you want to hear what russian public is hearing , they will tell you in their own words when the pow calls home - easy to find with timestamps , and then there are the subtitles ."
15520,fighting to the death sounds a lot more appealing in theory before you actually have to practically do it
15521,"because they had to . russian bombardment of the facility itself alongside a much tighter perimeter and presumably discovering most if not all of the tunnel exits meant they could only resupply off of dead soldiers that had tried to storm the facility . they were running out of food and medicine especially , but also likely that whatever source of potable water they were using had run out or broken . there was also an interview about a week before the main surrender where the commander said that the bombardment had destroyed a large freezer room they were using to store the bodies of their fallen comrades . with a bunch of sick and wounded people and no medicine , rotting corpses no matter how deep in the facility would make everyone sick both physically and mentally . they'd already said multiple times that the wounded were basically rotting to death already - any minor wound that gets infected could be a death sentence , any major wounds would just have to be treated as best as possible and then hope they don't die . it's quite likely they overall lost more men to wounds than to actual combat deaths over the 3 months . i think too that the sheer amount of them that had survived was a major factor . if they'd been whittled down to only a hundred or so men then it's easier to fight to the death than around 2000 soldiers just sitting there waiting to see if dehydration , illness , hunger or combat kills them first . the sheer number of them left means it's going to be harder for russia to disappear all of them so we'll eventually know what happened and then other countries can start doing things like saying the sanctions will last until all the surrendered soldiers are returned . can't return some ? well i guess the sanctions stand forever then ."
15522,"the "" no-fly zone "" is a linguistic manipulation . there is no such thing . this should be defined as "" the west's joining a direct war with russia """
15523,russia's combined arms tactics have improved quite a bit since the early days of the invasion . airstrikes are a very significant problem for ukraine . they are also the most likely means for russia to target the long range artillery that will soon deploy . the us should make it a policy of safeguarding the full territorial integrity any non-nuclear state that is attacked by a nuclear state . we should get off our butts and expel the russian's from ukraine ourselves . by taking the half mesures we have so far we risk losing our investment in rocket artillery to airstrikes . by taking half meausres we risk losing all of our investment in defending ukraine .
15524,"dunno abut this particular case but the goal of russian lying does not have to be to convince anyone of anything . might just be to get in an alternative narrative asap to sow confusion/uncertainty . not saying that it works out here , just that it's probably not a priority that the lie should be convincing ."
15525,"i believe theyre winning the war , but right now theyve lost more ground than id like , and the west isnt helping a s much as id like ."
15526,"one last thing because i'm a dummy and i forgot to include it in the original comment . how realistic would it be for nato to send some of these warships through not with the intention of handing them off to ukraine , but as escort vessels for grain shipments ? a couple of these plus awacs and air coverage in the form of nato jets loaded with air to air missiles and harpoons/exocets would likely dissuade russia from messing with them . especially if doing so threatened to bring actual nato forces into play ."
15527,"there's a simpler solution to ukraine's artillery woes : manufacture 152mm shells to send ukraine . ukraine has about a thousand guns that use this ammo , far more than western supplied tubes . but here's the bigger problem : this shit is old . and bad . their accuracy is terrible resulting in a lot of wasted shots . what you want is "" sten "" precision weaponry ... make something like excalibur shells but without busting the bank just to maximize its edge-usefulness . make the cheapest precision weapons possible that just about do what it's needed to do without trying to showcase the limits of what can be done . what if you want the precision of excalibur , but the target isn't 40 miles away ? waste a $ 70k shell that you only needed half its capability for ? what if you want the range of excalibur , but just wanted to saturate an area rather than hit the commander's tent perfectly with the first shot ? this is why for all the fanfare around excalibur , almost nobody is buying them . because for a tenth of the price , you can buy the m1156 precision guided kit , which just screws onto a normal , dumb 155mm round and turns it into a gps guided round . it can't travel 40 miles , but how often do you need that ? and if you do need that range , why not use something like himars instead ? or for little more than the price of a normal dumb round , you can buy m795s which give extra range . not quite as much as excalibur , but still enough to outrange other artillery . as for the artillery pieces themselves , the problem isn't production , since these aren't being produced by ukraine they're produced by the west which has deep pockets , it's a matter of political will . the west has enough working guns * in storage * alone to happily arm ukraine to the teeth . finland alone has 1,500 + artillery in service . it's politically easier to send a few very capable guns than a lot of low quality guns , since people really only look at the headline number . if you only have the political will to send 12 howitzers , better give them 12 of your best howitzers than 12 of your worst . as zelensky pointed out , if nato gave 1/10th of its equipment to ukraine , ukraine would win this war very quickly indeed while barely making a noticeable dent on nato's firepower . 1/10th would work out to roughly 1,500 tanks , 1,200 artillery , 2,000 combat aircraft , 11,000 armoured vehicles ."
15528,"the situation is not necessarily comparable . ukraine has a large amount of older cheaper artillery but those guns really weren't serving the purpose ukraine needed them to . ideally ukraine is hitting the russians with out inflicting a ton of collateral damage . with the older stuff they could certainly hit russian positions but they'd also be hitting civilians , infrastructure and so on . yes the old equipment is cheaper upfront but in the long run the damage it inflicts is going to be far more expensive for ukraine . spend 100-200 million on some fancy artillery , or spend 10 or 20 billion rebuilding an entire city"
15529,"not yet , but if the reports they're putting out are accurate it's definitely working towards softening up the russian forces . a better way to think of it would be to look at how russia has won most of it's battles over the last 2 to 3 months - massive amounts of shelling to blow up any cover or defenses and the ukrainian soldiers , vehicles and equipment etc and then pushing in to force them to either retreat or fight without any real defenses . ukraine has been steadily attacking the russian rear with the himars so far . they're destroying ammo , supplies , logistic capabilities , barracks , vehicles and air defenses . as a result it looks like russian shelling has drastically reduced along most fronts and they're resorting to launching rockets and missiles at civilian targets in cities to force ukraine into surrendering . at some point ukraine will start concentrating fire on one part of the frontline instead of everywhere and will essentially be able to do the exact same thing russia did except with more precision - blow up any significant defenses in an area then send in some tanks and infantry to clear out anyone left . at the moment they're still working on reducing russian capabilities over the entire front line though ."
15530,"if you want understand the * himars factor * ( h-factor o h-fucktor ) just look the nasa map that give the data where fire was on last 24-48h on the ukraine . look before the himars presence and then look every day that the himars popup the ruz's ammo depots blowing up and the new fire on ukrainian zone reduce by numbers ... now pratically the fire on back line of ruz are more than the opposite ... this not only help stopping artillery , this will help crushing the ruz defence and the ruz morale , it's all rock n roll till you finish on the end side of a volley...after you become pink aerosol and purple dust . and if appear that ammo depots and command centre are gone now will be the turn of electronic warfare , aa system and ruz troopers base ..."
15531,they have changed the game as russia can no longer keep armaments close to the front but must move them 6 hours or so back . 12 hour round trip .
15532,"what passes for good taste is very very different in a war . it isn't hyperbole for the ukrainians , even if it seems over the top for us , they're the ones who need to dig deep inside themselves to survive rape , torture , and genocide . how they do that isn't really for us to judge"
15533,also not very realistic . there's a lot more blood and terrible gasping/gurgling noises when someone's throat is slit and they struggle to keep breathing . it's not instant death like in the movies .
15534,"bad taste . but it looks like there will never be reporchmand between russians and ukrainians . they will always hate each other , like china vs japan ."
15535,according to liveuamaps russia is loosing territory at the rate of tens of km^2 per day for the last weeks . they are gaining in some areas but loosing more in others . i won't pretend to know what's going to happen when this war ends but as of right now russia is achieving none of their objectives and over all not winning .
15536,"i don't know what maps your looking at mate , russia has been losing ground for weeks now . and they're almost out of troops , missiles , and tanks . at the same time ukraine has virtually unlimited supply from half the planet . at this point i'm unsure if russia could win even with full mobilization . they are already to point where half their troops would be invading on foot or in civilian cars ."
15537,"russia is basically a kingdom . sanctions should remain in place until putin is dead or retired to a solitary cell . there is also the matter of reparations . putin's personal fortune , estimated at over $ 200 billion , is only about half of the repair bill for rebuilding ukraine , at the earliest the war might come to an end ."
15538,war has to have an end eventually . taking away sanctions against russia after the war is over and they have been held accountable is the right thing to do . otherwise youll just get a pissed of russia in 20-30 years . similar to germany after wwi . we helped german and japan rebuild after wwii .
15539,"ive been really curious about this . the population of mariupol is the demographic the neo-nazis in azov were initially prejudiced against and have now been defending for months , and i might be naive , but i wonder if fighting a real genocidal occupation has knocked some sense into the guys who signed up for neo-nazi militias . there havent been reports of any of the kind of dangerous activity youd see from an ethnonationalist militia ( eg balkans ) and i wonder if the z war has deradicalized these guys , if azov essentially denazified themselves ."
15540,"as they say , if you owe the loan shark a million dollars , you're in trouble , of you owe them a billion dollars , they're in trouble .. same here if a salient of russians have a thousand ukrainians surrounded , the ukrainians are in deep shit .. if the russian salient has managed to surround twenty thousand ukrainian fighters though , it's not so clear anymore who's in deeper shit"
15541,"given that russia hasnt come close to doing anything like that in the last 3 months , im guessing no ."
15542,you already have a knowledgeable reply but here is my perception as a casual follower . ukraine is a separate country . period . the end . its not in russias jurisdiction to right a perceived wrong within ukraine borders . its not in russias jurisdiction to annex illegally created republics .
15543,"each of those points is a pretty massive thing to discuss and most of it is trying to prove a negative - like how can you prove there is no persecution ? surely you can only prove that there is ? there were a lot of reputable international organisations monitoring the situation in the donbas , including the osce ( of which russia is a member ), the ohchr and amnesty international . none found anything close to the allegations suggested by the russian government . nobody talks about minsk though so ill rant a bit about that because it summarises the situation in my opinion . the original minsk ii is in russian ( that totally banned language remember ) but heres an english translation . [ take a read of it . it's only 3 pages long . now minsk ii required certain constitutional changes , but was fairly vague on what these were to be . that isnt unusual , international agreements are normally pretty vague . the point is to provide a framework to work towards in boring behind the scenes discussions . and this was the problem . after minsk ii was ratified , ukraine passed a law which , as per the agreement , approved special status for the donbas and called for local elections , much to the annoyance of ukrainian opposition politicians who thought it was giving into russias demands . so russia must have been pretty happy with this right ? not quite , they criticised it because the elections were to be held legally under the jurisdiction of ukraine . there is nothing in minsk ii which says this is an issue , but russia was making it one . [ now normally this would just be a little wrinkle to work out behind the scenes . so ukraine approaches russia to discuss it , and russia refuses . why ? they claimed they were not a party to the agreement , but were only mediators like france or germany . if ukraine wanted to discuss it , they would have to discuss it with the lnr and dpr authorities , who were the real parties . \[.\] com/politics/865384 only , ukraine couldnt discuss it with the lnr and dpr authorities , because to do so would be to recognise their legitimacy , which they cant do until they hold elections . and we go in circles . so who is right ? was russia a mediator along with france or germany , or were they an actual party ? take a look at the document for a hint . [ there are no signatures from france or germany ( mediators ). russias signature is the third from the bottom , alongside the dnr and lnr authorities ( parties to the agreement ). russia is essentially demanding ukraine implement sweeping constitutional changes , based on a single paragraph of text , while refusing to talk to them about what they will view as acceptable based on an arbitrary ( and easily disprovable ) legal distinction . instead they sit back , wait for ukraine to try to implement it , then say "" no no that's not right , why are you refusing to implement minsk ?"""
15544,"there are so many sources that it would take quite a lot of time to gather them . and it's pointless since none of those will make the russians think they are mistaken . as the saying goes , it's impossible to win an argument with a fool because while you're limited by facts the fool is not limited by anything . \- the legitimately-elected president was illegally deposed no , the president was not illegally deposed . he fled the country . it wasn't like he was captured by the opposition and overthrown , no . one morning he simply disappeared and the next day he shows up in rostov city in russia . so what to you do when the president abandons his post ? there is no precise procedure for this case . the law only states that if the president is unable to perform his duties , it is the head of the parliament who assumes the president's duties until a new election is conducted . and in order to initiate the new election the parliament made a political decision to end the president's term prematurely because he was not planning to return . there is no specific law that describes this particular procedure because no one ever expected a president to run away from the country . but there is also no law that prohibits it , that's why the parliament was absolutely legally entitled to make this political decision . and that's what russian propaganda picked up and spun as "" illegal takeover of power "". no , it was absolutely legal , the parliament did everything in a democratic procedure and according to the law and the constitution . \- the illegitimate ukrainian gov't then sent in the army , and russia decided to defend the russians living there no . it's the russians who started the war . they started it by sending their saboteurs to overthrow local authorities in several regions : in kharkiv , luhansk , donetsk , kherson , mykolaiv , odessa . these were armed military people obviously from russia , supported by some locals . ukraine was able to quickly react to those events , although it was tough and the saboteurs almost succeeded in some of the cities . kharkiv , kherson , mykolaiv were a complete failure for the saboteurs , they didn't have any local support and no success at all . in odessa there were heavy clashes between locals : civilian pro-ua protesters vs . pro-rus protesters supported by some organized crime and even local corrupt police . it resulted in a deadly standoff near labor unions building where the fire in the building killed dozens of pro-russian protesters - this was picked up and spun by russian propaganda as well . eventually the odessa situation was contained and pro-russian forces and corrupt police fled . but in donetsk and luhansk it was much worse . there was just not enough pro-ua support from the locals , they consumed too much russian propaganda over the past years and were generally more pro-rus than pro-ua . google for a donetsk pro-ua peaceful protest rally , where a pro-ua protester was killed in clashes . at some point in donetsk and luhansk the cities ' administrations were captured by armed saboteurs . first gunfights started to happen in the cities . and that was the moment when the ukrainian authorities decided to deploy national guard . an absolutely rightful and lawful response . and no , those saboteurs were not local . they were russians . some of them tried to disguise themselves as local , some of them openly confirmed they were from russia . later we all would get to know that they were led by igor "" strelkov "" girkin - former gru officer . in response to ukrainian deployment of the national guard , the russians started bringing heavy equipment and arms across the border . and thus the war began . \- the ukrainian gov't was persecuting ethnic russians in the donbas no , never . actually , why the hell is it you who should supply sources to counter this bs argument ? it's them who should give you a source : who , how many , when - was being persecuted for russian culture . \- russia tried to make peace with minsk agreements , but zelensky wouldn't honor it once again , facts ? what are their sources to prove this claim ? minsk agreements wasn't something pushed by the russians , it was something pushed by the europeans . the russians used minsk to their own advantage . they wanted ukraine to officially recognize the donbas region that they captured as an autonomous region with wide legal power and independent administration , to change ukrainian constitution to declare ukraine as a federal country , to apply russian as a second official language and so on . this was not and never will be acceptable for ukraine , because it was obviously a trap set for future annexations of ukrainian regions by russia . ukraine pushed for russians to withdraw their forces , to return the control of the border to ukrainian military . and only after that ukraine would discuss autonomy of donbas . this was not acceptable for russia . that's why the minsk agreements were doomed to fail : they were never satisfying for any party . the long negotiation process bought ukraine some time which helped restore the country economically and most importantly restore the military . so ukraine was winning in the war , that's why the russians had to directly intervene to inflict damage to ukrainian armed forces to force ukraine to the negotiations table . this was the reason why minks happened in first palace . and this was the reason why minsk-2 happened , after ukrainian armed forced almost entirely destroyed the separatists and russians intervened and almost destroyed uaf . google ilovaysk . minsk-2 was more in favor of russia's demands , but still it wasn't satisfying for neither side and negotiations stalled in lack of constructive progress . ultimately , this became the reason why the russians made the decision to resolve their cause militarily - hence the full scale invasion of 2022 . \- russia was forced to defend the russian-speaking peoples nothing threatened the russian-speaking population in ua . absolutely nothing . donbas region was peaceful and prospering resource-rich industrial region of ukraine . before russians started this bloodbath in 2014 . russians are the greatest threat to russian-speaking population in other countries . because if you are a russian-speaker somewhere in , let's say , latvia or kazakhstan - be sure that russia is looking into ways to start some sort of war with your country sooner or later . to kill you and your family , destroy your house and the future of your kids . just to "" protected you "" from your country ."
15545,">\- the illegitimate ukrainian gov't then sent in the army , and russia decided to defend the russians living there . this has what has led to the conflict -- and to the ukrainians killing many ethnic russians as a result . on this point , the war only started because strelkov and his troops siezed sloviansk . there wouldn't have been a war otherwise , and strelkov says as much . i think you can be pro-vatnik while also having this fact correct . the follow-up note about russian language is silly considering zelensky speaks russian as his first language ."
15546,"the legitimate president you talk about stole huge amounts of money from ukraine to make himself rich . thats why he is in jail now . he was voted out , and an actual democratic process stated after that . only russians to late that kind of behaviour in their leaders . russia responded with its attacks on ukraines sovereignty in 2014 . the issue was ukraine is developing economically and culturally and was going to surpass russia in the next 10-20 years . russia cant handle that , because it will cause ordinary russians to realise they are being conned . this war is about stopping democracy . why ? because thats the only card putin has . he knows autocracy doesnt work . it never has . the stuff you are saying is just bullshit made up to justify bad behaviour by criminal leaders ."
15547,ukraine was not trying to cleanse ethnic russians or quash the russian language . zelensky himself spoke russian before ukrainian .
15548,so they attempted to attack kyiv ?
15549,"here is your refutation . > - so finally , russia was forced to defend the russian-speaking peoples of eastern ukraine with force . defend by attacking with 1000 tanks ? this makes about as little sense as calling america's invasion of grenada in 1983 , a defensive act . another argument can be gleaned from putin's statements . - putin has said ukraine is not a nation , and therefore russia has the right to swallow the whole country . - ukraine has been an independent country for 29 years . this is like britain saying they had the right to reconquer the usa during the war of 1812 . - when putin was asked by nato leaders what he would need to stop the war , he said : - nato must withdraw all forces from poland and the baltic states , and give them up to russian rule . none of the above facts fit with your russian friends ' narratives . these facts do fit with russia trying to expand its borders at least until almost all of the old soviet union has been swallowed ."
15550,he doesnt really need to be there anyway . its defensive ministers that need to go . macron trudeau havent been either
15551,ppl dying by tens of thousands and this tosser is acting like an offended 6 year old .
15552,probably not without massive casualties for the ukrainians
15553,hitting supply and staging areas in belgorod is definitely worth it and they are already doing so . they need to be careful about not hitting civilians though .
15554,ukraine must balance any benefit against the risk of putins claiming that russia is being invaded to justify more evil such as using tactical nukes .
15555,should be a very good complement to the stinger missiles . flying missions over ukraine is now quite risky for the russian air force . i don't see them greatly increasing their rate of sorties .
15556,"lots of ukrainian tech , like switchblades , is way ahead of ru , and ua is getting super precise real time intelligence from usa are two massive differences ."
15557,"ukraine has 10x the population , finland had support from sweden , ukraine support from the free world ."
15558,"come on , it was just propaganda . it was fun while it lasted , however ."
15559,gotta leave a route open so the russians can flea back to russia . and then you hit it !
15560," it's ` kyiv `, not ` kiev `. support ukraine by using the correct spelling ! [ learn more ]( ___ [^( why spelling matters )]( ^(|) [^( other ways to support ukraine )]( ^(|) ^( i'm a bot , sorry if i'm missing context )"
15561,"don't forget - "" oh you don't get your news from ...."" do you ? well , surely somewhere someone must have foreseen all this and there's a web site somewhere ?"
15562,"yeah and , i hate to say it , but you don't get to invade a country just because you disagree with their politics . i mean , these assholes are struggling to find any photos of any ukranian ultra nationalists - which you will find in any country if you look hard enough - so god knows where they are finding enough evidence to justify cruise missile strikes on civilian targets ."
15563,so half the world supports the slaughter of civilians in bucha ? really ? you'll have to give me a source for that .
15564,some actually sober interpretation . glad you put it out here .
15565,"i won't blame them for wanting russia humiliated ( i want that too ) or criticising macron statement , it's more that some comment are too anti france for me and i'm getting tired of the surrender joke ( as if the free france forces did nothing , i'd much prefer jokes on the french army doctrinal problem , the flaws of our 1940 tanks , the communication and commandment issue )"
15566,i guess it depends who theyre telling too . if they re telling their home audience then its probably a bigger lie .
15567,"the russians have definitely gained ground , but we still need to answer three big questions for context : 1 ) how much ground would they be expected to have gained by now for the advance to be considered "" successful ""? 2 ) how many casualties have the russians been taking for this ground ? 3 ) are the ukrainians trading ground for tactical advantage , as has been mentioned elsewhere on the thread ?"
15568,russia is very artillery heavy . the ukrainian forces have to give up ground to artillery barrages so as not to be destroyed and counter attack later . so expect russia to lose a lot of infantry and tanks but gain ground due to artillery . western 155mm artillery systems will change this once they are amassed/at the front/supplied with full inventory of shells .
15569,"or ukrainians giving them ground so russians can get overextended , same playbook as in the north ."
15570,"i would imagine that a lot of these "" we are thinking of sending some tanks ..."" articles are designed to off-foot the russians . have they already sent the tanks ? should we hold back forces in case the tanks come later ? do we over commit forces for tanks that aren't there ? is it only tanks ?"
15571,"true true , drat , my plan foiled . i was wondering if others thought stuff happens under the radar as well , or if every piece of equipment is transparantly communicated"
15572,there is a reason i posted this in the megathread and not a top level post . we'll see how it plays out .
15573,thats tribal thinking . strange for a supposedly developed nation .
15574,"hasn't russia been doing this since their earlier invasion of eastern ukraine , though ? eight years or so ."
15575,"i agree . im more referring to ever other political conversation weve talked about . i think i suddenly learned hes super pro authoritarian , anti-west . its insane because he was raise sun silicon valley . but his family is iranian so im assuming thats where these views come from ."
15576,"more often than not they're just reich-wingers who don't have the spine to say it out loud so it's basically "" i'm a moderate centrist but i think the holocaust should have happened """
15577,that seems like assumptions and leading questions to me .
15578,"exactly . they don't do it out of honor ; they do it out of lack of discipline , morale , logistics , etc ."
15579,"i gotta say , i know we are shipping them stuff but is it enough for a counteroffensive ? we are seeing quite a number of western weapons in donbas which either means they are sending better weapons or are running out of old munitions and have to use the newer stuff . i can guarantee ukraine is going through its older stockpile at a pretty damn fast pace in any case . ukraine will have more than enough manpower in late summer , but will it have enough modernish material ? i don't think we are sending stuff at a pace to even replace the losses ."
15580,"exactly this . the himars have shown to be effective at reducing russias artillery advantage over the last few days but it remains to be seen if ru can over come this or continue their offensive capabilities without massive artillery advantages . id also note that the ukrainians seem to be effectively employing a fabian strategy to the war . russia keeps taking very little ground for extremely high cost . they have yet to prove they are capable of sustaining these losses , especially if they dont have the aforementioned artillery advantage"
15581,either flagged for opsec or bullshit .
15582,i thought it was a very realistic take on the situation and the urgency of greater action now really is paramount . waiting until the situation turns worse is far too late . you have to be ahead of the curve in war or things can get very ugly very fast .
15583,"so defence is the best offence , at least in this war ."
15584,"and that's the sad part . moscovia can just go stubborn , not release them and that'd be it . we haven't got 1mln of moscovian pows ."
15585,"also in their idiocy and simple minded propaganda effort they actually miss what could be an actual point . that it's not an issue of nato expansion , it's the issue of nato being purely defensive in nature . russian diplomats did have a bad reaction after the intervention in serbia , especially considering that serbia is their "" orthodox historical brother slav nation "". so it would alarm them that "" hey you say that this is defensive only , but you're attacking serbia , did they attack you !?!"" and also the nato libya bombing . that one i really don't agree with , i still remember the news media declaring "" gaddafi wants to make a rape caravan "" e.t.c and a lot of hysterical stuff . then after the no fly zone nato bombed the great man made river . i was critical of that , of what basis was that about protecting civilians ? i felt it was a bad sign of the future of libya . then no fly zone wasn't just no flying , it then was followed by bombing gaddafi's convoys directly and his son was killed , then special forces helped guide the rebels to eliminate gaddafi . so putin was furious about gaddafi's death because obviously he's scared that one day the people will do that to him , so that probably pisses him off as well . the actions of nato in libya kind of poison all this talk about a "" no fly zone "" and why it will never happen . if nato declares a nfz then immediately china most oppose it , also it brings up old wounds , a lot of people are still not happy about what a nfz meant for libya . and some also for serbia . all putin would have to say is "" well if you do that i will nuke "" and it will immediately fracture nato as it goes from putin making a mistake and bludnering an unprovoked war , to ' aggressive nato is expanding and trying to forcefully bully russia '. people in the west will be divided and won't want to risk or be going on the offensive against russia and many international countries will take sides e.t.c i think the fact that they go after the simple argument of "" nato is expanding blah blah "" shows it isn't actually about nato , they know nato won't attack them . it's purely a talking point . anyway it's clear it was never about nato expansion , it's just a talking point and it's a sore point because we know it quells their ambitions for expansion , subjugation and creating satellite states and a sphere of influence . it's clear that if the baltics weren't already in nato we could be facing a crisis now of them trying to manufacture separatist movements in latvia , lithuania and estonia also , not just ukraine ."
15586,"> because otherwise they're just prolonging the war . i've never understood this rationale . if the ukrainians want to prolong the war and keep fighting , that's their choice . if they want to keep fighting until they push russia off their land , that's their decision , not outsiders ."
15587,"probably about as credible as the rumors of taliban tunnels back in the early 2000's : not that the soviets didn't build large strange underground complexes , but just that it doesn't seem likely there would be any reason to have one underneath a large steel mill . maybe a big bunker , but why a maze of tunnels going anywhere else if the reason is to protect the workforce from nukes ? and in the case of nukes , why would the mill be expected to be useable afterwards anyways ? i think more likely the defenders have some decent sized basements and things that are just normally there because of the massive industrial complex above . but not that deep because it is literally right next to the waters edge ."
15588,"wasnt it 140k rounds for 72 guns , not 40k rounds ?"
15589,"> my view is somewhere down the road russia will give it all back this sounds a bit deluded to be honest . * > the russian decision to double down is a high-stakes gamble . if russia mobilises and eventually overcomes ukrainian resistance then nato will face an aggressive , isolated and militarised state . if russia loses then president putin has now begun radicalising the population in the pursuit of policies that he will struggle to deliver . failure to defeat the ukrainian state after relentlessly comparing it to the nazi regime may have serious consequences for putin and those around him . to frame a conflict as existential and to lose must necessarily call the suitability of a leader into question among russias political elites . nato states therefore need to consider how to manage escalation pathways that follow if russia is not only defeated in donbas but finds its newly mobilised and poorly trained troops , with few remaining stocks of precision munitions , unable to deliver a victory in the summer . the death of putins political project is plausible , but it has already inflicted immense damage internationally and risks doing considerably more . * ( emphasis mine ) > though speculative , likely triggers for escalation into each subsequent phase of the conflict might include > * an assessment that the campaign has stalled temporarily and different approaches are needed to regain momentum ; > * an assessment that the campaign has stalled outright and recovery is unlikely without more extreme measures ; and > * ** an assessment that defeat is imminent , and that putin may fall from power , placing all his options on the table .** * > its not just putins possible success that scares me , its also the possibility of a big failure for russia . so if were in a situation where either success or failure both present horrible , dangerous situations , wed better be very careful and think very , very carefully about what we can do , and perhaps what we cannot do , and prepare accordingly . you dont want to corner putin with sanctions to the extent that he feels that he must gambleall or nothing . the impulse , and i certainly share it , is to punish him severely . but if you punish him too severely , then you risk his doing even more dangerous things in order to protect himself personally . so its a very difficult tightrope to walk ."
15590,so its not a rational decision ?
15591,"so if the 300 can disable a artillery , than a 600 which is heavier can actually destroy one ?"
15592,the artillery provided to ua ground forces have nearly twice the range and more explosive power than anything russian ground forces have deployed .
15593,do you maybe have a source ?
15594,oan
15595,do you have any source or analysis ? i keep checking every day and it looks like russians are grabbing territory little by little .
15596,"switchblade anti tank drones are pretty much better than anything else i can imagine i mean a good fpv drone pilot - can just fly it almost invisibly from any location 5m above the ground , the launch location is almost impossible to determine . much better than any atgm , but im not expert ."
15597,russian
15598,"tows and atgms aren't slow , they are very fast . they just look slow because of the focal length of the sight . it's like watching a baseball pitcher on tv ."
15599,"fuck thats bleak , but youre probably right . i wouldnt be surprised if that city was just about leveled ."
15600,well help rebuild . i hope they can push them back .
15601,"thanks ! i'm wondering specifically what slurs the russians are using in this war to refer to ukrainians . historically , these kinds of slurs have been used in various wars to denote the enemy as sub-human , animal or insect . like the nazis referring to jews as rats , or the tutsis in rwanda being called cockroaches . the ukrainians using the term "" orc "" follows the same trend . so i'm curious to know if the russians have started using some new dehumanizing slur since the outbreak of the war as well ."
15602,"thank you , that really clears things up for me :)"
15603,"weren't they kinda advertised as anti-tank weapons ? my opinion is that the war , now in an artillery-heavy phase and relies less on tanks and other armored vehicles , is not switchblade's stomping ground . btw , aren't we hearing less about javelins , too ?"
15604,"he's nuts , but he's not wrong on the military front . without mobilization , this whole thing is unachievable for russia . hell even with mobilization i don't know how they could try and hold the country ."
15605,"yeah , he's obviously a lunatic but imo his perspective makes far more sense than the "" strategic mastermind "" putin ."
15606,"the faster they fail , the faster they go home . they need to be less rapey and murdery though ."
15607,i feel for you and your country . i am donating what i can . stay safe .
15608,"we'll see about russia having more resources and income . hopefully , sanctions stay in place until the russian regime changes on a fundamental level . and russian resources cannot be fully capitalized on without a lot of things they lack - like an educated and motivated workforce . because russia is rich in raw materials , but lack pretty much everything it takes to make an end product out of it ."
15609,"i think this is possibly more likely than some realise . russia can try to go to full mobilisation but it's not simple and basically won't be ready in time . therefore if ukraine mobilises volunteers/conscripts quickly enough and keep the weapons and ammo flowing , then they can turn the whole war . the danger is that they lose in donbas , the jfo is destroyed and they are forced to sue for peace in the next few weeks ."
15610,"the russian population base is brittle due to low birthrate in key demographics as well as inaccessible without full mobilization . putin would have to admit russia was in a nasty shooting war to access his full manpower . ukraine is in a defensive , existential war . they have full access to their manpower ."
15611,what kind of weapon system can nato give ukraine that can defend themselves from the missiles ?
15612,so basicially ukraine's alternative against missiles are limited unless they get something like the iron dome that israel has ?
15613,"why is that guy being put on russian state tv , now ? it can't be an accident ."
15614,"i agree but if i would be a member of azov , i would expect to get a special treatment from russian army . and not the one you want ."
15615,"bad taste is subjective . im sure this imagery brings a bit of comfort to the many , many female victims of russian rape and terrorism . not to mention : isis recorded plenty of executions of this style , and none were so clean as this "
15616,>** and they have been held accountable ** highlighting the part that matters .
15617,"good luck with "" helping russia rebuild "". that is slightly more realistic than "" establishing 3-4 self-sufficient colonies on mars in the next 7-10 years "", but not much more realistic . you clearly haven't met any russians , have you ?"
15618,russia is far too dangerous to not keep under sanctions . they have proved this . we can't go back to simply supplying them with the material they need too attack their next target . sure maybe if they yield to ukrainian demands to go back to jan 24th positions perhaps we can lift some sanctions but we have to be very careful .
15619,"azov battalion was raised in mariupol , so they are defending their own . also its change a lot since it was raised in 2014 . its much larger and the extreme right wing flavour , while still present is much less noticeable due to the larger size of the unit and turnover in manpower over the last 8 years ."
15620,"agreed . they might manage to encircle , but then be very weak in the centre ."
15621,"russia is doing a lot better than this forum would lead you to believe . they have the men and materials even if they have to bring out 50 year old tanks that ukraine just does not have . i can not tell you how much i want ukraine to hold on but the us and that bloody germany need to step up and give them the munitions they need and get them there now.sure russian materials may be poor and the tanks old and the men not motivated but they have so many more of all of them that that does not matter . if they can activate 5000 old tanks to run over the ukrainian infantry it will be lights out . here is a really good non-biased report on what is actually going on . [ yes , ukraine is hanging on , by the skin of their teeth . for russia it is no longer about taking over a land route to wherever , it is about saving face . something much more politically important . so , hang in there ukraine . we are with you if only in spirit . if i thought it would make a difference i would even pray for you . it is going to be tough ."
15622,"really interesting points , thank you . i'm going to take a closer look at these documents ."
15623,"i agree . this is full of unsourced allegations-that come out of the russian propaganda machine . it is up to russia to evidence this stuff . i have read widely around the subject in fairly in depth accounts of the history of the country , and whilst there is another side , none of these statements can be treated as serious factual claims . that other side is about russians claim to crimea , the history of nato encroachment and the use of spheres of influence by both super powers historically . the nazies persecuting russians in the donbass is just russian propaganda , but that doesnt mean everyone in the donbass wanted to be part of a separate ukraine . many of them didnt - they identified with russia and some were prepared to fight for that too against ukraine . quite how those guys feel now , is anyones guess . but remember that russia originally populated the donbass as a form of cultural appropriation of ukraine under the old ussr . those people were encouraged to move to ukraine years ago so that russia had a claim over it , especially the rich industrial lands of the donbass ."
15624,"if your polls are bad you can go , like boris"
15625,i want to see a starstreak take down a bear or tu55 in mariupol .
15626,"in france , we got the classic big bad bfm tv when an analyst is on it , then they proceed to use the kremlin rhetoric ( funny to see them complain about propaganda when they're doing that )"
15627,"yes , they can google for flights to moscow ."
15628,"they don't support bucha . they've mostly not heard of it . it's just a war in europe , just as europe ignores many on-going wars in africa . and they ask themselves what's so different about it ."
15629,"the people you see insulting the french are just the loudest ones . sometimes theyre just having an emotional reaction , and sometimes its just trolls who enjoy piling on when they think they see an easy target . either way , know that there are many people outside france who know both what france is doing the help in this war , and what theyve done in the past . my country probably wouldnt even exist if it wasnt for the help of the french !"
15630,"the surrender "" jokes "" are from people who get their history from tv , or stopped reading after highschool . sadly , the latter category includes many many dickheads with a penchant for authoritarian governments , nazi sympathiser sorts . france bled by the millions in both world wars . this worn out gambit was never an issue of bravery , it is the lazy person's method of dehumanizing others they would be violent towards , but lack the means to do so . 9 out of 10 times it's an alt-right child being edgy ... it's pathetic that most of them reached the age of majority years or decade ago ."
15631,"1 . they need all of ukraine for a victory , anything less is a failure . 2 . there's no way to tell with the fog of war , but if we go by the equipment losses that are visually verified on oryx , i'd side with the ukrainian number and slap a 20 % propaganda margin on it . if assumed those are just the killed in action , times that number by 2 and the total will give an impression of casualties . in any case , too many to sustain their advance . without putting a number on the total casualties or killed in action , we can verify the axis of advance of the russians has grinded to a low pace . they took izyum on the first of april and have barely moved 10 kilometers west and south of izyum 29 days later . either they got their head up their ass and can't work a compass or they've got some serious issues down there they had to solve before pushing up further . 3 . absolutely , ukraine has structured its defense around a defense in depth doctrine . essentially its manoeuvre warfare but on the defense instead of on the offensive . they remain highly flexible and mobile . if ivan shows up with a motorstrelski to take a point , they put up resistance . if that's enough to break the attack , great . they stay in place and await the next one . if it isn't enough to break an attack , they fall back to the next line of defense instead of remaining static in a fight to the last man . this creates a situation where the ruski's get trapped in a pocket of their own making on which nearby ukrainian units launch counter offensives on from the flanks . if that's enough to push the ruski's back , the ukrainian unit that fell back from the point moves back in and the cycle continues . if the counteroffensive fails however , all ukrainian units simply fall back to the next line of defense and do it all over again . this repeats every field the russians cross , every village they take , and everytime the ukrainians fall back to the next line of defense , their forces become more concentrated and are able to put up a bit more resistance than previously . this keeps going on untill the ukrainians are forced to fall back within the local cities of the regions they defend , where heavy urban combat ensues stalling the russian advance even more . and if the resistance in those local population centers isn't enough to break the russians only then the region will be abandoned , after which it all repeats in the next region . if the coin flips the other way , and russia exhausts its offensive capabilities , thats when ukraine seizes the oppertunity to take the initiative and launch a counter offensive . this doctrine is exemplified by the battle of kiev , the battle of voznesens'k , the battle for cherneviv , the battle for kharkov and what we're seeing right now in the battle for donbass ."
15632,"> have they already sent the tanks ? should we hold back forces in case the tanks come later ? do we over commit forces for tanks that aren't there ? is it only tanks ? for an example look at the hoopla about the tanks being sent from czech republic or old bmps from germany etc and then suddenly it is revealed at some point about 100 polish t-72s went "" missing ""."
15633,"they aren't really developed . like , at all . a developed nation at least requires some level of development standard across a whole nation . russia is more like a collection of developed city-states that lays claim to and subjugates the surrounding area to drain them of resources . all of the development is focused inside mosow , st petersburg , and maaaaaaybe a couple other smaller cities ."
15634,they arent a developed nation . it was all a farce .
15635,"hard to say . some "" allies "" are sending nothing despite promises to do so . a lot of allies that really want to help barely have anything to give . us seems to be sending a lot . but ... like most recent bill approved a large aid package , but as far as i know only $ 20 billion of it is military aid . meanwhile russian military budget was 66 billion last year . surely will jump up now . of course russia has its own host of problems - lack of manpower , no way to replenish many of the stocks . but yes - suddenly russian plan of waiting out the western desire to help ukraine and grinding down ukrainian armed forces after does not seem so impossible to achieve , does it ?"
15636,"yes . he was absolutely accurate in saying a long term conflict actually does not favor ukraine . we can celebrate some positive movement , but its largely symbolic if there arent clear and decisive actions taken in the next 60 days ."
15637,"actually , yes . since standard military doctrine calls for a 3:1 force advantage to succeed against a dug in defense , the general expectation is that the attacker will take disproportionate casualties ."
15638,"yeah , the reasoning is pretty sick . it assumes that ukraine can't possibly win and that their defeat would be no big deal , in complete denial of the horrorshow that russian occupation is already proven to be , simply because the one arguing for appeasement is feeling personally uncomfortable . it's literally saying "" you're going to get raped , just lie back and take it ."""
15639,"it would have been making replacement parts keeping the soviet fleet going during ww3 if the cold war went hot . so this level of over engineering isnt too far fetched , every nation has a similar facility either a few big ones or lots of small ones . the soviet union had near limitless workers , concrete and metal . so not surprised they went for a few huge sites . as apposed to say the uk that has lots of small ones . im sure there will be sub access , maybe not more than a mini sub dock but i bet it has one . will be super interesting and im sure horrifying the stories that will come out of there after the war ."
15640,"that's why so many european intelligence agencies were caught off guard . even zelenski was surprised , despite us warning . putin made the most irrational move a leader could have done ."
15641,"the 600 has a javaline warhead , so a direct hit would very likely destroy one ."
15642,i hope very soon that ukraine will be left in peace and that the russian people can find peace with themselves and their neighbors and cease the mindless violence and sabotage . it upsets me to know that russia could be such a valuable friend but their government has chosen war and paranoia for generations . i hope that you and for family will find peace and prosperity soon .
15643,"[ [ imagine using the liveua map as a source for territorial control lmao . anywho , here's what's going on with that territory.ukraine has structured it's defence around a defense in depth doctrine . they do not set up their defence in a very static spread out line around the border , where the russians could engage one point in a single battle , push through and then surround the rest of the line . instead , their defense is layered and revolves for a large part around delaying the enemy , rather than prevent them from moving up.the way this works in ukraine is that their units don't hold static positions . rather they remain manoeuvrable and flexible . when ivan lunges forward with a motorstrelski , the ukrainians put up a bit of resistance . if that resistance is enough to break the attack . great , the unit remains where it is and awaits either the next assault or makes ready to support the next unit down the line if they're the ones being assaulted . however , if ivan is determined to push through with the attack , the ukrainians simply pack up their shit , fall back to the next defensive line and radio in to the units around them that they're doing so . ivan gets to take the point , sure . but the surrounding ukrainian units now have a motorstrelski caught in a pocket and get to work on it . again , if the counter attack at that point is enough to break ivan into a retreat , good . the unit that fell back from the point now moves back into the point and the cycle repeats . however , if ivan brought enough manpower and is able to hold off the counter attack , ivan gets to take the point . when it is clear this is the case . all ukrainian units simply pack up their shit , fall back to the next defensive line and the story repeats . in the meantime artillery from the rear of ukraine works on the russians as the ruski's now have a forward point in which to set up their assetts , regroup or reorganise from the previous assault and get their shit together to do it all again . this keeps repeating untill the ukrainians have literally had to retreat in to the city's on the east . from where they fight the ruski's on the streets in urban combat and again , delay them as much as possible as the next defensive line behind the city's is established . it all amounts to a very frustrating situation for the ruski's in where they have to fight multiple battles for a little bit of terrain , and even when they get that little bit of terrain they get to do it all over again for the next objective they'll have to take . this is examplified by the defeat russia suffered around kyiv . the battle for irpin/hostomel/bucha . but also down in makariv to the south west of kyiv . where the ukrainians allowed russia to overstretch their lines , only held them in urban terrain and in the meantime ambushed the russian supply line . this is much the same on the east of kyiv . for 30 days the russians attempted to take kyiv , and suffered so many casualties doing it , suffered so many losses in their logistical abillity they had to give up on kyiv completely . their only ticket to a swift end of the war and they lost it . they were defeated . if you remember the salient of a few motorstrelski's that tried to bypass mykolaiv by driving up north towards the closest bridge over the bug river by voznesens'k . they were utterly defeated in the same way . more recently , we're seeing ukraine succefully go on the counteroffensive by kharkov . where they applied the same strategy and worn down the russians so far that they are now incapable of even mounting a defense against the ukrainians . and keep in mind that by kharkov , russia's supply lines are shortest . across the border lies belgorod at roughly 50km's from kharkov and yet the russians are incapable to even supply their units not even 30km's away from a major logistical hub for this invasion . today both ruska lozova and momotove were liberated from russian control and there's fuck all the russians in that area can do about it . so , lets take a look at the russian succes stories so far . the first week of the invasion , they got their way and were able to embark on these rediculous salients capturing towns , strategic crossroads and a few city's . i'd say kherson is the most important one . but after ukraine mobilised , got their shit together . it's where it ended for the russians . the eastern front has been absolutely static on the russians end for 6 to 7 weeks already . beyond their initial results there's very sparce actual tactical victories for them to celebrate . most recently , they were able to take izyum after a long and quite hard fight . but since then , what have they achieved ? they've been able to push maybe 10 kilometers to the south and to the west of izyum . where we see the ukrainians acting out their defense in depth again . if the russians cross fields to try to get the next little village , they get hit . if they succesfully capture the village , they are largely unable to destroy the ukrainians who defended that village , and on their way to the next village , guess who'se taking shots at them ? the same ukrainians from that first village . and that keeps going on , and on , and on , and on , until after suffering losses , and fighting for every kilometer they reach the next midlly urban area . where they encounter the concentrated forces of the ukrainians who have been tormenting them all the way to get there . if you look at it objectivly , the territory controlled by russia in ukraine is not even 20 % of the country , and without total control of the country , removing the leadership and subjugating the populace there can be no victory for russia . without the total destruction of the ukrainian armed forces , or at the very least destruction to the point where the ukrainian military can pose no threat . there is no victory for russia . there's just more war to be fought . and if you take in perspective the losses russia has suffered so far , just by looking at the known losses posted by oryx . russia simply does not have the capability to keep this up forever . in the meantime , ukraine is grinding them down . sure , they give up a little territory but ivan is paying dearly for it . tl;dr ; russia isn't winning , ukraine isn't losing . we're in round 3 of a 12 round boxing match . and ukraine is still standing , still fighting . edit - oh , and lets not forget about the partisan activities already reported in the area of melitopol . it won't be the only area in which partisans will become active after its clear the territory is seperated from the ukrainian armed forces"
15644,grabbing territory but at what costs ? advancing is not the same as winning . you could advance all the way to moscow and still lose
15645,"indeed , although there are plenty of smart munitions in the west that'll make your head spin . the newest excalibur artillery rounds , as well as having a 70km range in certain configurations , are laser ** or gps ** guided with autonomous targetting . they can scan the ground with radar , identify targets such as tanks , and home in on them targetting the weakest points on the vehicle . they can chase target vehicles travelling at least 70mph . the shell's fuse can switch between an airburst , contact , or penetration detonation depending on the target . meanwhile , newer missiles like the british brimstone can do all that autonomous targeting , while communicating with dozens of other brimstone missiles in mid-flight to ensure they each go for different targets . if there's more brimstone missiles than targets then they attack one after the other , assessing which targets should be hit a second time . we're finally coming to the point where modern , miniaturised processing power and sensor capabilities , of the kind found in our smartphones , are being applied to battlefield munitions . switchblades are okay , but they require the operator to spend the entire time piloting it , trying to spot enemy targets on a screen . meanwhile the newest smart munitions you basically just aim towards russia and fire and let the munition's own sensors and "" brain "" do all the work for you ."
15646,"they just lie to thier people with a massive propaganda campain , thats why putin needed the synchronization of the media . but i think it will get harder for them to hide thier faliure and loss of soldiers with every day the war keeps going ."
15647,no city there just rubble . worse place on earth i'm sure .
15648,no we won't . it needs to remain as a reminder . normal people forgot how bad of a world actor russia is and always has been . i hope you all know china would be just as bad if they could do the same .
15649,"as a moderator here i also want to emphasize that we wholesale remove and issue bans if a user is using the term "" orc "" to describe in general russians since - as you say yourself - it is used historically to dehumanize an entire race/population of people so that when atrocities are committed also against them people are able to feel desensitized to it . obviously , i understand that this use of the term is being made to understand it from an educational perspective and it doesn't violate the rules due to that , but just wanted to emphasize that so it's made clear on where the sub stands on the term's usage ."
15650,i think you make a very good point about the phase of the war . perhaps the switchblade does best in a more chaotic enviroment where the enemy is advancing and doesnt have full situational awareness .
15651,loitering munitions like the switchblade are the reason for the cages on top of most of the tanks . i have a feeling they're being used on different targets than the tanks .
15652,ukraine has already mobilized everyone they can . theyve basically been handing out weapons to anyone willing to fight .
15653,sam
15654,yeah for real . i think a lot of people have missed that .
15655,"they often come from a lack of knowledge of what the french army did during both 1940 and after the defeat for me(i don't forget the verry bad part , vichy france , ptain didn't protected french jews and participated in the holocaust , the sto , pierre laval speech "" je souhaite la victoire de l'allemagne "", collaboration with the nazis ...)."
15656,it also denies agency to ukrainians . it acts like ukraine is just some buffer state whose fate should be dictated in a negotiation between russia and the west . as opposed to a sovereign nation full of independent people who should be the primary parties deciding when they want to stop resisting .
15657,lots of universities and office builds have tunnel complexes like this for just moving people and supplies around .

15659,"interesting . i had no previous knowledge of the brimstones , are they available as ground based munitions now ? wikipedia article focuses on air-launched munitions , but i assume ukr doesn't have the capability to fly airplanes in contested regions / it would be a lot better for them to use ground launch ."
15660,we will . theyre already drawing up a mar hall plan for ukraine . might not be enough but it will help .
15661,"thanks , good to make that clear ."
15662,"yup , it's incredibly dehumanizing . and they'll excuse it by saying that * they're * not thinking of ukraine as a buffer state , but the reality is that the "" great powers "" do , and that we have no choice but to accommodate that ( the implication being that if you think otherwise you're naive ). that fuckwit jeffrey sachs has been spewing his appeasement argument in the media lately and he never once takes into account what ukrainians want . he's a rape apologist ."

15671,"im an estonian . no wonder , russians we try to not put ukrainians and russians close together ( in schools , for example ), because russians would harass them . if your car or house does have a ukrainian flag to show support and many russians live in neighborhood , be ready they will throw a rock into your window . russians , such wonderful people ! they came , raped , looted , killed , sent estonians to gulags and siberia . took our freedom and made us second class citizens for 46 years . the kremlin put a huge number of russians into estonia and latvia to russify these countries . russians didnt care to learn the local language . they told to us speak the human language! ( russian , of course .) in the 90s after occupation , they told us that wait and see , mother russia is coming back , your independence is temporary. they didnt care to learn estonian or latvian language . its humiliating for the mighty and glorious russian nation to learn some pointless and dirty estonian . russia language is a real language , russian culture is a real culture . russia is a real country , estonia isnt even a real country . they tell us the russians were our liberators . sending estonians to gulags and siberia didnt happen ! in 2007 we removed one soviet memorial statue with a soviet liberating soldier from our capital tallinn , because estonians had enough of watching that rapist-looter-killer-occupier . russians started rioting-looting in our capital . in that moment in our country the police didnt exist , all our police forces were sent to capital to manage uprising against nazi government. in the 90s and until around 2015 they called us nationalists-nazis who oppress them . that in estonia the state language is only estonian is oppressive . voting patterns ( many do have russian citizenship ) have shown they support putin even more than the russians in russia . now in 2022 ? ukrainians are nazis who oppress russians ! washingtons puppets ! ukrainians are dumb , they dont understand what is really happening ! to get enlightened what is really happening , one should consume russian tv and online portals . estonia is the 4th country in the media freedom index ( russia 155th ), but everything in estonian media is shit and fake news , washingtons propaganda . they believe russian media and russian narratives . its a choice , a preference . it's only putin , russians are wonderful people ! : d * thankfully in 2022 i can relax myself watching burning orc tanks . thanks , ukrainians !*"

15687,"put on a uniform and make it happen tough guy ! oh youd rather bully women at the beach than fight ? gotcha . no wonder nobody fears you , your country , or your army ."
15688,estonia should send him to the frontlines as a volunteer for ukraine . hopefully he gets sent back in a body bag .
15689,"the offensive remarks of these russian idiots are the clear hallmarks of bullies , who nearly always act out of deep seated insecurity . respect to these women who know who they are and know who these fools are . we all also know many proud ukrainians already have russian as first language , just by virtue of the parts of ukraine they were born in . many fight against russia and get bombed by russia just like their compatriot "" ukraini-glots "" and they hate putin just as much . it saddens me to sometimes see remarks suggesting that they are somehow less ukrainian or less anti-putin . few ukrainians seem to discriminate against "" russi-glots "" just because of their mother tongue but some do . not wise - it pre-judges the person and gives putin something else with which to distort the truth and brainwash his population . anyone using the language someone learned as a baby , as a tool of abuse , derision or division is a an idiot ."

15732,yeah its happened in daugavpils also in latvia
15733,believe it or not - ukrainians in majority can behave in exile . ( though not so much those who profit from illegal immigration i'm afraid ) and if the action can invoke wrath of local police - we ain't doing it . one should be an exemplary human being while hes a guest in another country . good proof of that would be how markus(ananjev ) well-known ukrainian airborn officer met russian propagandist sheinin during his vacation and stoped himself from killing the bastard just because he was on a foreign ground .
